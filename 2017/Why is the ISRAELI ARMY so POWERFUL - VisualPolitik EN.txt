3
00:00:06.83 --> 00:00:11.429
Israel does not have the world's biggest

4
00:00:09.12 --> 00:00:12.750
army but it is the most effective think

5
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.059
about it we are talking about a country

6
00:00:12.75 --> 00:00:17.250
with less than nine million habitants

7
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.100
nonetheless they have won wars against

8
00:00:17.25 --> 00:00:21.390
countries ten times bigger for example

9
00:00:20.1 --> 00:00:23.250
during the six days war Israel

10
00:00:21.39 --> 00:00:28.470
confronted a coalition that included

11
00:00:23.25 --> 00:00:30.359
Egypt Syria and Jordan all of these

12
00:00:28.47 --> 00:00:31.949
countries put together sums up to more

13
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.770
than a hundred and thirty million people

14
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.260
and they sent over two hundred and forty

15
00:00:34.77 --> 00:00:39.540
thousand soldiers twice as many as the

16
00:00:37.26 --> 00:00:41.460
Israeli army did in other words no one

17
00:00:39.54 --> 00:00:46.140
would expect a victory for Israel but

18
00:00:41.46 --> 00:00:48.059
history was rather different in just six

19
00:00:46.14 --> 00:00:50.700
days the Israeli Defense Forces also

20
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.949
known as IDF wiped out their enemies and

21
00:00:50.7 --> 00:00:54.870
yes I know what you're gonna say now the

22
00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.449
Israelis have the best technology and

23
00:00:54.87 --> 00:00:58.410
weaponry right well that is true now but

24
00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.420
it wasn't back then

25
00:00:58.41 --> 00:01:02.520
for instance in 1973 during the Yom

26
00:01:00.42 --> 00:01:04.290
Kippur War Israel's weapons were as

27
00:01:02.52 --> 00:01:08.820
modern as those of their main rival

28
00:01:04.29 --> 00:01:11.310
Syria in fact the IDF had some combat

29
00:01:08.82 --> 00:01:14.040
jets manufactured in the 1950s the

30
00:01:11.31 --> 00:01:15.689
famous a4 Skyhawk however the Syrians

31
00:01:14.04 --> 00:01:17.850
they had state-of-the-art anti-aircraft

32
00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.250
missiles they were given to the Soviets

33
00:01:17.85 --> 00:01:22.409
just five years before and who won that

34
00:01:20.25 --> 00:01:23.580
war yeah it was Israel all right all

35
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.350
right so I can hear some of you saying

36
00:01:23.58 --> 00:01:27.900
now I'll come on time but Israel has the

37
00:01:25.35 --> 00:01:30.110
sport of America that's a really big

38
00:01:27.9 --> 00:01:30.110
help

39
00:01:30.7 --> 00:01:35.710
and yes at this point you are right

40
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.049
Israel is the country that receives the

41
00:01:35.71 --> 00:01:39.700
most help from Uncle Sam but do you know

42
00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.009
of any other country who buys the best

43
00:01:39.7 --> 00:01:44.320
weaponry from America well that would be

44
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.110
Saudi Arabia the Saudis have an army as

45
00:01:44.32 --> 00:01:48.369
big and as modern as the Israeli one but

46
00:01:47.11 --> 00:01:49.869
if you've been subscribed to visual

47
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.429
politic for a while you already know

48
00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.829
that the big failure of the Saudi army

49
00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.319
was fighting guerrilla warriors namely

50
00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.390
those who the rebels from Yemen in other

51
00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.340
words neither the technology nor the

52
00:01:58.39 --> 00:02:03.039
Americans support are enough to explain

53
00:02:00.34 --> 00:02:08.140
why the Israeli army is such a fearful

54
00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:10.569
one so the question of the day is why is

55
00:02:08.14 --> 00:02:12.459
the Israeli army so powerful what are

56
00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.920
the key elements explaining such

57
00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.140
military success well today we are going

58
00:02:14.92 --> 00:02:23.530
to tell you the five key facts that

59
00:02:17.14 --> 00:02:25.540
explain this vast decision-making every

60
00:02:23.53 --> 00:02:28.599
army is based on hierarchy and authority

61
00:02:25.54 --> 00:02:30.730
right well some of them they're more

62
00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.799
flexible than others in this other video

63
00:02:30.73 --> 00:02:34.900
we explained how the Saudi Army has a

64
00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.730
bigger sense of hierarchy and the

65
00:02:34.9 --> 00:02:38.769
officials don't have much power to make

66
00:02:36.73 --> 00:02:40.780
their own decisions the same goes with

67
00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.540
other Arabic countries like Syria or

68
00:02:40.78 --> 00:02:45.579
Egypt so here is an example imagine a

69
00:02:43.54 --> 00:02:46.900
Syrian unit defending a position let's

70
00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.549
say their headquarters have been

71
00:02:46.9 --> 00:02:50.890
destroyed before the soldiers in the

72
00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.600
front line are aware of it

73
00:02:50.89 --> 00:02:54.340
if they have to follow the normal

74
00:02:52.6 --> 00:02:56.200
procedure they will have to wait until

75
00:02:54.34 --> 00:02:57.670
someone gives them an order during this

76
00:02:56.2 --> 00:03:00.370
time they don't know if they should

77
00:02:57.67 --> 00:03:02.620
retreat strike back or coordinate with

78
00:03:00.37 --> 00:03:04.090
other military units all right so now um

79
00:03:02.62 --> 00:03:06.070
are you wondering well why are Arab

80
00:03:04.09 --> 00:03:07.390
armies so centralized now don't forget

81
00:03:06.07 --> 00:03:09.700
the most of these countries are

82
00:03:07.39 --> 00:03:12.070
dictatorships or absolute monarchies if

83
00:03:09.7 --> 00:03:13.960
you are a tyrant you want your army to

84
00:03:12.07 --> 00:03:16.000
be under control in order to micromanage

85
00:03:13.96 --> 00:03:19.840
every little decision in order to

86
00:03:16.0 --> 00:03:22.510
prevent a coup d'etat the Israeli army

87
00:03:19.84 --> 00:03:24.459
is way different from that let's look

88
00:03:22.51 --> 00:03:26.230
back to our previous example in this

89
00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.480
case the Israeli commander on the front

90
00:03:26.23 --> 00:03:30.640
line wouldn't need to wait for orders he

91
00:03:28.48 --> 00:03:32.890
has a degree of his own decision-making

92
00:03:30.64 --> 00:03:34.989
power so he can react immediately and

93
00:03:32.89 --> 00:03:37.150
seize opportunities in fact this is

94
00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.040
pretty normal in almost all Western

95
00:03:37.15 --> 00:03:41.530
armies the big planning is centralized

96
00:03:39.04 --> 00:03:43.300
but the execution is decentralized this

97
00:03:41.53 --> 00:03:44.610
way the organization is more flexible

98
00:03:43.3 --> 00:03:47.800
and can react more quickly

99
00:03:44.61 --> 00:03:50.500
[Music]

100
00:03:47.8 --> 00:03:52.630
but unlike the Western countries Israel

101
00:03:50.5 --> 00:03:54.610
has something unique in their culture we

102
00:03:52.63 --> 00:03:57.400
are talking about a pretty unknown fact

103
00:03:54.61 --> 00:03:58.540
about this country yes it is a very very

104
00:03:57.4 --> 00:04:00.970
important one

105
00:03:58.54 --> 00:04:03.190
Israel is the least hierarchical country

106
00:04:00.97 --> 00:04:05.620
on the planet and you can feel this in

107
00:04:03.19 --> 00:04:07.240
every aspect of their culture inside of

108
00:04:05.62 --> 00:04:08.710
an Israeli company it's pretty normal

109
00:04:07.24 --> 00:04:10.960
for an average worker to have a

110
00:04:08.71 --> 00:04:13.000
discussion with his boss debates are a

111
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:17.920
common thing and there is a pretty small

112
00:04:13.0 --> 00:04:19.900
sense of Authority actually in the 1970s

113
00:04:17.92 --> 00:04:21.580
of Dutch anthropologist named Geert

114
00:04:19.9 --> 00:04:23.500
Hofstede er studied the power

115
00:04:21.58 --> 00:04:25.720
relationships in different countries

116
00:04:23.5 --> 00:04:27.790
over the course of six years he surveyed

117
00:04:25.72 --> 00:04:30.610
IBM workers in different offices around

118
00:04:27.79 --> 00:04:33.220
the globe this is how the power distance

119
00:04:30.61 --> 00:04:35.500
index was born and among all those

120
00:04:33.22 --> 00:04:37.600
countries Israel has the lowest power

121
00:04:35.5 --> 00:04:40.030
distance while the Arab countries like

122
00:04:37.6 --> 00:04:42.550
Egypt or Saudi Arabia rank among the

123
00:04:40.03 --> 00:04:44.380
highest in other words Israeli citizens

124
00:04:42.55 --> 00:04:48.790
are educated in flexibility more than

125
00:04:44.38 --> 00:04:50.770
any other nation internal cohesion in

126
00:04:48.79 --> 00:04:53.169
Israel military service is mandatory for

127
00:04:50.77 --> 00:04:55.480
every citizen regardless of their social

128
00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.580
condition or their gender both men and

129
00:04:55.48 --> 00:04:59.250
women rich and poor start from the very

130
00:04:57.58 --> 00:05:03.110
bottom

131
00:04:59.25 --> 00:05:05.449
[Music]

132
00:05:03.11 --> 00:05:07.250
well actually this is not entirely true

133
00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.960
because the ultra-orthodox Jews don't

134
00:05:07.25 --> 00:05:11.509
need to do military service and neither

135
00:05:08.96 --> 00:05:13.490
does Israel's Palestinian population but

136
00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.169
the rest of Israel's citizens must serve

137
00:05:13.49 --> 00:05:17.810
in the military and fall into a

138
00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.120
meritocratic scheme this means everyone

139
00:05:17.81 --> 00:05:23.330
must follow the same rules in order to

140
00:05:20.12 --> 00:05:24.080
be promoted and this is not as common as

141
00:05:23.33 --> 00:05:25.610
you might think

142
00:05:24.08 --> 00:05:27.139
for instance during world war ii the

143
00:05:25.61 --> 00:05:29.419
aristocrats who joined the British Army

144
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.230
started with higher positions than the

145
00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:35.970
peasants and the working-class

146
00:05:32.23 --> 00:05:38.400
[Music]

147
00:05:35.97 --> 00:05:40.350
and of course such elitism it tends to

148
00:05:38.4 --> 00:05:42.150
destroy an Army's morale and make it

149
00:05:40.35 --> 00:05:44.070
harder for it function for example the

150
00:05:42.15 --> 00:05:47.560
Saudi army consists of both civil

151
00:05:44.07 --> 00:05:50.810
servants and members of the royal family

152
00:05:47.56 --> 00:05:50.810
[Music]

153
00:05:53.27 --> 00:05:58.070
and hierarchy matters a lot the son of a

154
00:05:56.15 --> 00:06:00.080
Saudi prince will never be a soldier and

155
00:05:58.07 --> 00:06:02.400
as you can imagine this classist

156
00:06:00.08 --> 00:06:06.719
structure has negative consequences

157
00:06:02.4 --> 00:06:10.889
[Music]

158
00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:12.839
our bat morale in the year 1973 Israel

159
00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.759
forced the Egyptian and the Syrian army

160
00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.979
at the same time as we said at the

161
00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.689
beginning back then Israel was not the

162
00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.289
technological powerhouse that it is

163
00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.269
today

164
00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.189
Syrians had those anti-aircraft guns the

165
00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.779
s 200 s that we mentioned before and

166
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.179
during the first days those

167
00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.879
anti-aircraft missiles destroyed a lot

168
00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:32.269
of Israeli combat jets Israel had to

169
00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.269
retreat

170
00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.389
nonetheless Uncle Sam was here to help

171
00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.860
the White House sends a package of

172
00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.650
weapons so they could neutralize the

173
00:06:37.86 --> 00:06:42.330
s200 than the radars things like flares

174
00:06:40.65 --> 00:06:46.409
that could confuse the smart missiles

175
00:06:42.33 --> 00:06:48.330
that were guided by temperature this way

176
00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.740
the Israeli struck back and in a short

177
00:06:48.33 --> 00:06:51.870
amount of time they finished off the

178
00:06:49.74 --> 00:06:53.999
Syrian defenses and well guess what

179
00:06:51.87 --> 00:06:56.009
happened next well the lot of those Arab

180
00:06:53.999 --> 00:07:02.759
soldiers scared of being wiped out from

181
00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:04.199
the air well they defected if you look

182
00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.749
at the picture on the screen you will

183
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:11.029
see seven Syrian tanks they are not

184
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:11.029
moving but not one of them is destroyed

185
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.930
well it means that the soldiers that

186
00:07:13.74 --> 00:07:18.419
were inside of those tanks they decided

187
00:07:15.93 --> 00:07:21.059
to run away defection is a common

188
00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:25.680
problem when morale is low and this is a

189
00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:27.210
common problem for Arab armies 20 Syrian

190
00:07:25.68 --> 00:07:29.309
troops defect to southern Turkish

191
00:07:27.21 --> 00:07:31.379
province of Hut a think about it if you

192
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:33.689
are an Israeli soldier or an American

193
00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:36.210
one you know you must be loyal to your

194
00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:40.610
country but Arab soldiers have too many

195
00:07:36.21 --> 00:07:40.610
ethnic national and religious identities

196
00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:46.179
imagine you are a Syrian soldier at the

197
00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:48.159
same time you are occurred or you belong

198
00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:50.139
to the Muslim Brotherhood both groups

199
00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.449
are chased by the Syrian government so

200
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:53.799
well who are you loyal to of course the

201
00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:56.379
army pays your bills but when your life

202
00:07:53.799 --> 00:08:00.719
is a risk and everything is lost more

203
00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:00.719
importance your salary or your life

204
00:08:01.51 --> 00:08:05.980
in other words no matter your wealth and

205
00:08:03.85 --> 00:08:08.320
your technology if your soldiers are not

206
00:08:05.98 --> 00:08:10.690
strongly motivated you've already lost

207
00:08:08.32 --> 00:08:12.260
and the Israelis they know that better

208
00:08:10.69 --> 00:08:15.959
than anyone

209
00:08:12.26 --> 00:08:15.959
[Music]

210
00:08:16.14 --> 00:08:21.340
all tanks place their engines on the

211
00:08:18.67 --> 00:08:23.380
backside but why is this because usually

212
00:08:21.34 --> 00:08:25.060
the rocket sit on the front side and you

213
00:08:23.38 --> 00:08:27.400
want your tank to keep working even

214
00:08:25.06 --> 00:08:29.500
after being hit this is why all the

215
00:08:27.4 --> 00:08:30.520
models from the German leopards to the

216
00:08:29.5 --> 00:08:32.140
Russian t-90s

217
00:08:30.52 --> 00:08:34.450
keep their engines in the back

218
00:08:32.14 --> 00:08:36.250
nonetheless the Israeli army doesn't

219
00:08:34.45 --> 00:08:38.500
value the vehicle as much as their

220
00:08:36.25 --> 00:08:41.140
soldiers this is why the Israeli Merkava

221
00:08:38.5 --> 00:08:46.720
is the only one of its kind that has the

222
00:08:41.14 --> 00:08:47.830
engines in the front this way a rocket

223
00:08:46.72 --> 00:08:49.540
will destroy the tank but it will

224
00:08:47.83 --> 00:08:51.400
protect the soldiers putting aside the

225
00:08:49.54 --> 00:08:53.170
ethics Israel has a really small

226
00:08:51.4 --> 00:08:54.880
population this means that they can't

227
00:08:53.17 --> 00:08:57.160
allow themselves to lose too many

228
00:08:54.88 --> 00:08:59.290
soldiers this is why they receive much

229
00:08:57.16 --> 00:09:01.420
more intense training with real bullets

230
00:08:59.29 --> 00:09:03.160
and better equipment and don't forget

231
00:09:01.42 --> 00:09:05.680
that this is the country where Krav Maga

232
00:09:03.16 --> 00:09:07.300
one most advanced martial arts was born

233
00:09:05.68 --> 00:09:09.580
you can also see this human capital

234
00:09:07.3 --> 00:09:11.890
doctrine reflected in their intelligence

235
00:09:09.58 --> 00:09:14.970
service the Mossad it is considered one

236
00:09:11.89 --> 00:09:18.760
of the best in the entire world

237
00:09:14.97 --> 00:09:20.350
and if one day you happen to travel to

238
00:09:18.76 --> 00:09:22.150
Israel you should know that they will

239
00:09:20.35 --> 00:09:24.580
take your phone number and other data

240
00:09:22.15 --> 00:09:26.040
because they know information is power

241
00:09:24.58 --> 00:09:27.899
[Music]

242
00:09:26.04 --> 00:09:29.279
but all right I right I know what you

243
00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.600
want to hear now you came to this video

244
00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:33.240
because you wanted to hear about

245
00:09:30.6 --> 00:09:43.110
state-of-the-art weaponry right well

246
00:09:33.24 --> 00:09:45.060
here you have it made in Israel during

247
00:09:43.11 --> 00:09:47.639
the 1980s the Israeli government wanted

248
00:09:45.06 --> 00:09:50.279
a secret weapon a weapon no one had ever

249
00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:52.410
heard of until recently so they met a

250
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:55.079
local manufacturer a company called

251
00:09:52.41 --> 00:10:00.720
rafael do you design a very special

252
00:09:55.079 --> 00:10:02.339
vehicle the so called para this is a

253
00:10:00.72 --> 00:10:04.980
vehicle that looks like a tank but in

254
00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:06.540
fact is a tank hunter weapon with a big

255
00:10:04.98 --> 00:10:07.440
rocket launcher if you know about

256
00:10:06.54 --> 00:10:07.980
weapons you know there's a big

257
00:10:07.44 --> 00:10:09.720
difference

258
00:10:07.98 --> 00:10:11.579
tank weaponry has to reach a distance of

259
00:10:09.72 --> 00:10:14.699
between two and four kilometers para

260
00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:16.829
rockets can travel a distance of 30 so

261
00:10:14.699 --> 00:10:18.420
imagine the situation the enemies would

262
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:20.250
take satellite pictures to see the

263
00:10:18.42 --> 00:10:22.470
Israeli weaponry and they would see a

264
00:10:20.25 --> 00:10:24.029
lot of normal tanks based on this they

265
00:10:22.47 --> 00:10:26.220
would tan their strategy but then

266
00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:28.740
surprise surprise those tanks are not

267
00:10:26.22 --> 00:10:35.160
tanks Bart in fact something with a much

268
00:10:28.74 --> 00:10:36.720
much bigger reach the decades this

269
00:10:35.16 --> 00:10:39.209
parrot was one of the most mysterious

270
00:10:36.72 --> 00:10:41.069
weapons of the Israeli army and their

271
00:10:39.209 --> 00:10:42.690
main strength was that no one knew

272
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:45.089
anything about them so now the question

273
00:10:42.69 --> 00:10:47.430
is how come Israel makes its own secret

274
00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:49.050
weapons and other countries don't well

275
00:10:47.43 --> 00:10:50.730
the answer is that in Israel there are a

276
00:10:49.05 --> 00:10:52.769
lot of rocket science companies that

277
00:10:50.73 --> 00:10:54.480
give it a world-class defense industry

278
00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:57.360
so a while ago we did a video about

279
00:10:54.48 --> 00:10:58.980
Israeli startups well in the 1980s the

280
00:10:57.36 --> 00:11:01.199
Israeli government created a special

281
00:10:58.98 --> 00:11:03.180
program which was called yozma this

282
00:11:01.199 --> 00:11:05.220
program consisted of ten hedge funds

283
00:11:03.18 --> 00:11:07.649
with both private and government money

284
00:11:05.22 --> 00:11:09.600
in them those funds helps to create a

285
00:11:07.649 --> 00:11:11.040
lot of tech companies and you know what

286
00:11:09.6 --> 00:11:13.529
the favorite industry for those brand

287
00:11:11.04 --> 00:11:15.540
new startups was well of course it was

288
00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:17.850
the military industry at the end of the

289
00:11:15.54 --> 00:11:19.290
day the army it was a rich and reliable

290
00:11:17.85 --> 00:11:21.209
clients all of a sudden

291
00:11:19.29 --> 00:11:22.680
dozens of weapon manufacturers were born

292
00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:24.870
companies are creating customized

293
00:11:22.68 --> 00:11:28.680
products that met the exact needs of the

294
00:11:24.87 --> 00:11:31.300
Israeli army at every Mona

295
00:11:28.68 --> 00:11:33.580
from my iearned own defense system to

296
00:11:31.3 --> 00:11:35.230
the Merkava tanks or the Perret we

297
00:11:33.58 --> 00:11:36.490
mentioned before so now you might be

298
00:11:35.23 --> 00:11:37.899
wondering what happens in the other

299
00:11:36.49 --> 00:11:39.790
countries well let's first consider

300
00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:41.680
Saudi Arabia as you know the Saudi

301
00:11:39.79 --> 00:11:43.810
economy has got a problem it relies

302
00:11:41.68 --> 00:11:45.550
heavily on the oil industry of course

303
00:11:43.81 --> 00:11:47.470
thanks to the dinosaur juice the Saudis

304
00:11:45.55 --> 00:11:49.899
have become a rich and they can pay for

305
00:11:47.47 --> 00:11:55.959
the third biggest army in the world only

306
00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:58.899
surpassed by China and America but

307
00:11:55.959 --> 00:12:01.000
expensive is not a synonym for good the

308
00:11:58.899 --> 00:12:02.800
Saudi army buys their tanks from the USA

309
00:12:01.0 --> 00:12:04.029
and those are customized for the needs

310
00:12:02.8 --> 00:12:05.709
of the American army

311
00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:07.360
besides that makes it harder to have a

312
00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:08.980
secret weapon because everyone knows

313
00:12:07.36 --> 00:12:14.410
what you've bought on the international

314
00:12:08.98 --> 00:12:15.790
market alright so I probably know you're

315
00:12:14.41 --> 00:12:17.950
thinking now it seems that we're really

316
00:12:15.79 --> 00:12:19.270
talking up the Israelis right but do you

317
00:12:17.95 --> 00:12:21.430
make no mistake the Israeli army

318
00:12:19.27 --> 00:12:22.930
certainly has its weak points in fact

319
00:12:21.43 --> 00:12:24.820
there is an organization that could make

320
00:12:22.93 --> 00:12:26.380
their life even harder but that's

321
00:12:24.82 --> 00:12:32.050
something we're going to talk about in

322
00:12:26.38 --> 00:12:34.000
another video now the question for you

323
00:12:32.05 --> 00:12:35.560
is who do you think can defeat the

324
00:12:34.0 --> 00:12:37.720
Israeli army and what do you think there

325
00:12:35.56 --> 00:12:39.940
mainly points are well please leave your
