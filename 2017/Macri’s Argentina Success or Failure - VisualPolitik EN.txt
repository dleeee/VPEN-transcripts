34
00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.800
with more than 10 million votes they won

35
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.509
15 out of the 24 electoral districts

36
00:01:39.8 --> 00:01:43.580
including the top five these are the

37
00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.250
most populated ones - Aires province

38
00:01:43.58 --> 00:01:48.320
brannis aires city cordova Santa Fe and

39
00:01:46.25 --> 00:01:50.730
Mendoza something like that hasn't

40
00:01:48.32 --> 00:01:52.450
happened since 1985

00:01:50.73 --> 00:01:55.599
[Music]

[Applause]

43
00:01:57.42 --> 00:02:01.409
now after these elections can be a Maus

44
00:01:59.79 --> 00:02:03.210
is close to having an absolute majority

45
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:21.150
which ensures the government's ability

46
00:02:03.21 --> 00:02:22.770
to push their reform agenda forward for

47
00:02:21.15 --> 00:02:24.360
this reason several analysts have stated

48
00:02:22.77 --> 00:02:26.489
that this is the true beginning of

49
00:02:24.36 --> 00:02:28.350
macri's term so after two years of power

50
00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.450
what is mercury done what hasn't he done

51
00:02:28.35 --> 00:02:31.590
Anse what are his intentions you're

52
00:02:30.45 --> 00:02:33.540
gonna find the answers to all of these

53
00:02:31.59 --> 00:02:34.980
questions in today's video but before we

54
00:02:33.54 --> 00:02:42.200
do that let's take a look back at the

55
00:02:34.98 --> 00:02:44.850
history downfall

56
00:02:42.2 --> 00:02:47.160
[Music]

57
00:02:44.85 --> 00:02:49.110
a century ago Argentina was one of the

58
00:02:47.16 --> 00:02:50.730
richest countries in the world even

59
00:02:49.11 --> 00:02:54.630
richer than countries like Canada

60
00:02:50.73 --> 00:02:56.550
Australia France or even Germany and not

61
00:02:54.63 --> 00:02:59.310
only that when world war ii ended on may

62
00:02:56.55 --> 00:03:00.960
v8 in 1945 this country was along with

63
00:02:59.31 --> 00:03:03.180
the united states one of the largest

64
00:03:00.96 --> 00:03:05.520
creditors in the world and also one of

65
00:03:03.18 --> 00:03:08.670
the largest gold owners on the entire

66
00:03:05.52 --> 00:03:11.160
planet at that time Buenos Aires the

67
00:03:08.67 --> 00:03:13.710
Argentine capital was in full swing and

68
00:03:11.16 --> 00:03:15.270
could even rival New York of course

69
00:03:13.71 --> 00:03:16.530
having said all of that well you might

70
00:03:15.27 --> 00:03:24.570
now be wondering well what the hell

71
00:03:16.53 --> 00:03:26.670
happened to Argentina well even though

72
00:03:24.57 --> 00:03:28.290
things didn't look bad for this country

73
00:03:26.67 --> 00:03:32.330
after the Second World War the truth is

74
00:03:28.29 --> 00:03:32.330
that something it was already changing

75
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:36.860
the great international crisis of the

76
00:03:34.43 --> 00:03:39.190
1930s affected this country a lot

77
00:03:36.86 --> 00:03:41.690
Argentina which was a huge agricultural

78
00:03:39.19 --> 00:03:44.660
exporter suffered and has had its first

79
00:03:41.69 --> 00:03:47.030
major financial crisis and since that

80
00:03:44.66 --> 00:03:49.540
time all those years ago nothing has

81
00:03:47.03 --> 00:03:49.540
been the same

82
00:03:50.23 --> 00:03:55.239
politics dear viewer began to intervene

83
00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.000
in every economic and societal field

84
00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.190
finally in 1946 what we could call the

85
00:03:58.0 --> 00:04:01.959
definitive turn well it began the

86
00:04:00.19 --> 00:04:04.030
government of general Farrell first and

87
00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.239
then colonel juan domingo perón approved

88
00:04:04.03 --> 00:04:08.410
all kinds of rules and laws more than

89
00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.870
16-thousand in fact which puts the

90
00:04:08.41 --> 00:04:13.849
economy under state control

91
00:04:10.87 --> 00:04:16.130
[Music]

92
00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.810
something which for example meant that

93
00:04:16.13 --> 00:04:19.970
things like foreign trade business

94
00:04:17.81 --> 00:04:22.250
creation or competition wouldn't really

95
00:04:19.97 --> 00:04:24.770
be a priority instead policies such as

96
00:04:22.25 --> 00:04:27.229
import substitution nationalization and

97
00:04:24.77 --> 00:04:28.650
large state enterprises they became the

98
00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.620
order of the day

99
00:04:28.65 --> 00:04:34.560
[Music]

100
00:04:31.62 --> 00:04:36.479
this is how a seventy year downfall

101
00:04:34.56 --> 00:04:38.130
began which made Argentina become one of

102
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.500
the very few countries that has gone

103
00:04:38.13 --> 00:04:42.389
from a developed country to a developing

104
00:04:40.5 --> 00:04:44.669
country economic crisis hyperinflation

105
00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.979
and payment suspension have become very

106
00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.470
very common problems talked about in the

107
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.570
Argentinian media in recent decades and

108
00:04:49.47 --> 00:04:55.639
this process culminated with Kirchner

109
00:04:51.57 --> 00:04:55.639
ISM from Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner

throughout our two terms as president

114
00:05:10.21 --> 00:05:14.680
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner set up a

115
00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.229
model that could simply be defined as

116
00:05:14.68 --> 00:05:19.419
unyk an imagined Zeenat was already

117
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.009
pretty terrible at business but Cristina

118
00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.439
she took it a step further

119
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.150
see in CF Kay's Argentina there were

120
00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.099
capital controls companies couldn't

121
00:05:25.15 --> 00:05:28.479
repatriate their profits taxes on

122
00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.310
companies reached in comparable

123
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.050
proportions in Latin America there were

124
00:05:30.31 --> 00:05:34.509
lots of restrictions on imports and the

125
00:05:32.05 --> 00:05:36.610
central bank was only dedicated to

126
00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.060
making money in order to finance the

127
00:05:36.61 --> 00:05:39.060
government

128
00:05:41.77 --> 00:05:46.479
the model was so terribly uh neck anomic

129
00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.849
that CFK set up a lot of taxes on

130
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.870
exports yes who would really think of

131
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.550
punishing companies that are exporting

132
00:05:49.87 --> 00:05:54.550
selling to other countries

133
00:05:51.55 --> 00:05:56.949
it's pretty crazy indeed who know me

134
00:05:54.55 --> 00:05:57.849

but that isn't all with Christina at the

147
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.130
helm of the Casa Rosada the Argentine

148
00:06:29.12 --> 00:06:33.289
White House this country became one of

149
00:06:31.13 --> 00:06:35.570
the most protectionist in all of Latin

150
00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.280
America and also a country where setting

151
00:06:35.57 --> 00:06:39.350
up companies was incredibly difficult

152
00:06:37.28 --> 00:06:41.660
and of course the results they were

153
00:06:39.35 --> 00:06:43.610
immediate during her second term growth

154
00:06:41.66 --> 00:06:46.009
was null the public deficit soared

155
00:06:43.61 --> 00:06:48.830
inflation rose to 40 percent investment

156
00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:51.130
collapsed and suddenly again nothing

157
00:06:48.83 --> 00:06:54.199
seemed to work

158
00:06:51.13 --> 00:06:56.720
this is how in December of 2015 the

159
00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:59.449
Argentinian people chose Mauricio Macri

160
00:06:56.72 --> 00:07:02.090
former president of Boca jr. as the new

00:07:30.98 --> 00:07:34.100
of course this was bound to happen

169
00:07:32.24 --> 00:07:36.110
because of the terrible steak that he

170
00:07:34.1 --> 00:07:37.490
inherited the country in for example he

171
00:07:36.11 --> 00:07:39.410
reduced electricity and natural gas

172
00:07:37.49 --> 00:07:41.360

have immediate results things didn't

174
00:07:41.36 --> 00:07:48.050
look so great at the beginning in 2016

175
00:07:46.25 --> 00:07:50.750
the country suffered a severe recession

176
00:07:48.05 --> 00:07:52.820
with a GDP drop of 2.6 percent inflation

177
00:07:50.75 --> 00:07:55.280
also approached 40 percent poverty

178
00:07:52.82 --> 00:07:57.230
unemployment deficits and external debt

179
00:07:55.28 --> 00:07:59.720
also increased in other words there were

180
00:07:57.23 --> 00:08:01.490
ample opportunities to criticize Macri I

181
00:07:59.72 --> 00:08:05.900
mean wasn't he the one you promised that

182
00:08:01.49 --> 00:08:07.670
things were going to change well as we

183
00:08:05.9 --> 00:08:09.980
said a minute ago reforms do not have

184
00:08:07.67 --> 00:08:13.540
immediate results but in the end those

185
00:08:09.98 --> 00:08:13.540
changes they do arrive

186
00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:19.349
in 2017 the Argentine economy was

187
00:08:17.43 --> 00:08:21.599
finally showing signs of improvements

188
00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:23.789
this year's growth may exceed 3% and the

189
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:24.539
appetite for investment is already more

190
00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:26.520
than evidence

191
00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:30.949
yep that's right it looks like Argentina

192
00:08:26.52 --> 00:08:30.949
may be coming out of that long tunnel

193
00:08:31.05 --> 00:08:39.740
[Music]

194
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:42.199
Philip I'm being these results have

195
00:08:39.74 --> 00:08:44.329
given Macri the great electoral victory

196
00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:45.920
that we've just seen now we come to the

197
00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:47.930
question of what exactly did the

198
00:08:45.92 --> 00:08:49.759
president do well basically he reduced

199
00:08:47.93 --> 00:08:53.360
all of the crazy regulations and

200
00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:54.649
policies that have been put in place the

201
00:08:53.36 --> 00:08:56.209
new government it seemed got to work

202
00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:58.399
reducing these because in their eyes

203
00:08:56.209 --> 00:09:00.290
there was no time to lose as soon as he

204
00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:01.819
arrived he eliminated currency controls

205
00:09:00.29 --> 00:09:03.860
he allowed foreign investors to

206
00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:06.170
repatriate their profits he eliminated

207
00:09:03.86 --> 00:09:07.730
the most incomprehensible export taxes

208
00:09:06.17 --> 00:09:09.980
and reduced to subsidies and

209
00:09:07.73 --> 00:09:12.889
restrictions on imports and all of this

210
00:09:09.98 --> 00:09:15.170
was with one clear objective Argentina

211
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:17.300
had to recover its productive economy

212
00:09:15.17 --> 00:09:19.009
also and this is really important here

213
00:09:17.3 --> 00:09:20.569
Macri reached agreements with some of

214
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:23.540
the international investors that

215
00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:27.190
Argentina hadn't paid in 2001 hands with

216
00:09:23.54 --> 00:09:27.190
whom it still had judicial fights

217
00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:35.149
Argentina reached an agreement with the

218
00:09:32.81 --> 00:09:37.130
venture funds after 14 years of struggle

219
00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:39.829
in total to cover all the debts with the

220
00:09:37.13 --> 00:09:40.699
funds McCree offers sixty five hundred

221
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:43.339
million dollars

222
00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:45.199
this agreement implies a 25% reduction

223
00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:47.329
on the other hands the new government

224
00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:49.310
approved a kind of fiscal amnesty which

225
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:51.350
brought to light no less than a hundred

226
00:09:49.31 --> 00:09:53.209
and seventeen billion dollars the talent

227
00:09:51.35 --> 00:09:55.100
in Ian's had abroad and had not declared

228
00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:56.870
but before you think this is a huge

229
00:09:55.1 --> 00:09:58.310
scandal do you think about what would

230
00:09:56.87 --> 00:10:00.019
happen if you were afraid that your

231
00:09:58.31 --> 00:10:02.000
savings could be confiscated by the

232
00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:04.160
government's sometimes it's not just

233
00:10:02.0 --> 00:10:06.500
about not paying taxes when states don't

234
00:10:04.16 --> 00:10:08.690
have legal security it's easy for money

235
00:10:06.5 --> 00:10:10.069
to simply disappear the fact is that

236
00:10:08.69 --> 00:10:11.839
with all these measures macri's

237
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.910
government has managed to get much of

238
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:15.199
that money back to Argentina and since

239
00:10:13.91 --> 00:10:16.639
then there's been an influx of money

240
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:19.399
which has triggered things like real

241
00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:21.110
estate sales and car sales we are

242
00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:22.970
breaking records more than seven hundred

243
00:10:21.11 --> 00:10:25.010
and eighty thousand cars have been sold

244
00:10:22.97 --> 00:10:26.540
to this day and most importantly trucks

245
00:10:25.01 --> 00:10:28.970
this means that production is moving

246
00:10:26.54 --> 00:10:30.709
construction is moving Mauricio Macri it

247
00:10:28.97 --> 00:10:33.560
looks like the engine quite literally

248
00:10:30.709 --> 00:10:35.329
has started again Volkswagen will invest

249
00:10:33.56 --> 00:10:38.860
six hundred and fifty million u.s.

250
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:42.900
dollars to modernize plants in Argentina

254
00:10:47.58 --> 00:10:52.410
but one question arises and that's is

255
00:10:50.13 --> 00:10:54.810
everything really so exemplary is

256
00:10:52.41 --> 00:10:56.520
everything really so perfect well hold

257
00:10:54.81 --> 00:10:58.500
on a man because the truth is that until

258
00:10:56.52 --> 00:11:00.990
now the reforms have been very very

259
00:10:58.5 --> 00:11:03.150
gradual and had a fairly limited range

260
00:11:00.99 --> 00:11:05.250
something that in spite of the electoral

261
00:11:03.15 --> 00:11:07.410
results and all those calls to uncork

262
00:11:05.25 --> 00:11:10.470
the champagne has alerted several

263
00:11:07.41 --> 00:11:12.390
experts at the moment of truth so far he

264
00:11:10.47 --> 00:11:14.280
hasn't done much beyond removing

265
00:11:12.39 --> 00:11:15.930
Kitchener ISM from power which isn't

266
00:11:14.28 --> 00:11:17.730
little even though he did say that these

267
00:11:15.93 --> 00:11:19.290
elections are the endorsement for the

268
00:11:17.73 --> 00:11:21.840
reforms we don't really know what they

269
00:11:19.29 --> 00:11:24.600
are what he wants to do Carlos Rodriguez

270
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:26.850
Braun Argentine economist but why so

271
00:11:24.6 --> 00:11:28.440
much distrust because despite the

272
00:11:26.85 --> 00:11:30.420
reforms we've seen it seems that this

273
00:11:28.44 --> 00:11:31.950
government is struggling to overcome

274
00:11:30.42 --> 00:11:34.110
some of the typical problems of

275
00:11:31.95 --> 00:11:35.520
Argentina's previous governments for

276
00:11:34.11 --> 00:11:37.500
example public spending has not

277
00:11:35.52 --> 00:11:38.910
decreased it continues to rise and rise

278
00:11:37.5 --> 00:11:41.400
which is caused among other things

279
00:11:38.91 --> 00:11:43.350
foreign debt to soar by more than 50

280
00:11:41.4 --> 00:11:46.230
billion dollars since Macri came to

281
00:11:43.35 --> 00:11:48.120
power and that's not all

282
00:11:46.23 --> 00:11:49.530
taxes are through the roof the central

283
00:11:48.12 --> 00:11:51.240
bank continues to finance the government

284
00:11:49.53 --> 00:11:52.920
with new money and according to the

285
00:11:51.24 --> 00:11:54.540
latest doing business reports which

286
00:11:52.92 --> 00:11:56.640
measures the ease of doing business in

287
00:11:54.54 --> 00:12:01.100
the country Argentina is still way down

288
00:11:56.64 --> 00:12:01.100
in one hundred and sixteenth place

289
00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:08.600
now to be fair we can say the Macri has

290
00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:09.980
two pretty good excuses first is that

291
00:12:08.6 --> 00:12:11.839
not much time has passed

292
00:12:09.98 --> 00:12:14.239
second is political position in Congress

293
00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:16.009
and the Senate were very weak now but

294
00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:19.059
after these last elections all of that

295
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:19.059
is finally over

296
00:12:20.889 --> 00:12:27.030
a reformist agenda

297
00:12:25.55 --> 00:12:29.160
[Music]

298
00:12:27.03 --> 00:12:31.140
it seems that often is crushing

299
00:12:29.16 --> 00:12:34.380
electoral triumph president Macri has

300
00:12:31.14 --> 00:12:36.450
made it clear we are entering a stage of

301
00:12:34.38 --> 00:12:37.860
permanent reform ISM Argentina doesn't

302
00:12:36.45 --> 00:12:40.020
have to stop it doesn't have to fear

303
00:12:37.86 --> 00:12:42.720
reforms because to reform is to grow to

304
00:12:40.02 --> 00:12:44.430
evolve to progress Mauricio Macri he

305
00:12:42.72 --> 00:12:46.740
certainly has a task out of him which is

306
00:12:44.43 --> 00:12:49.050
somewhat complicated but well what are

307
00:12:46.74 --> 00:12:51.090
his priorities well fundamentally Divya

308
00:12:49.05 --> 00:12:53.880
at first it's something that is as

309
00:12:51.09 --> 00:12:55.980
unpopular as it is necessary reducing

310
00:12:53.88 --> 00:12:58.320
public deficit and controlling inflation

311
00:12:55.98 --> 00:13:00.000
which are ultimately related then he's

312
00:12:58.32 --> 00:13:01.920
going to get Argentina back to being a

313
00:13:00.0 --> 00:13:03.960
competitive and attractive country in

314
00:13:01.92 --> 00:13:05.730
which to invest to achieve this it has

315
00:13:03.96 --> 00:13:07.950
promised to approve a tax reform that

316
00:13:05.73 --> 00:13:10.230
reduces taxes on businesses and a labor

317
00:13:07.95 --> 00:13:13.050
reform that facilitates hiring as well

318
00:13:10.23 --> 00:13:14.910
as more free trade agreements Argentina

319
00:13:13.05 --> 00:13:16.500
and Chile signed the most ambitious free

320
00:13:14.91 --> 00:13:18.300
trade agreement in 20 years

321
00:13:16.5 --> 00:13:20.490
then pension educational and

322
00:13:18.3 --> 00:13:21.930
infrastructure reforms are next yes we

323
00:13:20.49 --> 00:13:23.820
consistently say the Macri has a lot of

324
00:13:21.93 --> 00:13:25.680
work to do if he wants to meet the high

325
00:13:23.82 --> 00:13:30.240
expectations that have been placed on

326
00:13:25.68 --> 00:13:32.790
him in any case it does seem as if a new

327
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:35.340
political and economic era has begun

328
00:13:32.79 --> 00:13:37.020
Virgin Tina a good example is macri's

329
00:13:35.34 --> 00:13:39.180
commitment to reducing poverty by

330
00:13:37.02 --> 00:13:41.730
formalizing and extending property to

331
00:13:39.18 --> 00:13:43.980
the most disadvantaged Argentina

332
00:13:41.73 --> 00:13:45.960
delivers housing certificates to 1.5

333
00:13:43.98 --> 00:13:47.760
million people in slums Makris

334
00:13:45.96 --> 00:13:49.980
government will give them the documents

335
00:13:47.76 --> 00:13:51.840
to access water and electricity legally

336
00:13:49.98 --> 00:13:53.850
and by the way we will be discussing how

337
00:13:51.84 --> 00:13:55.680
to fight poverty in a future video so

338
00:13:53.85 --> 00:13:57.720
you know subscribe for now the question

339
00:13:55.68 --> 00:13:59.550
is will this country become great once

340
00:13:57.72 --> 00:14:01.290
again if they managed to deepen their

341
00:13:59.55 --> 00:14:03.090
reforms and take advantage of all their

342
00:14:01.29 --> 00:14:04.230
