[Applause]

2
00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.019
today we're going to talk about the

3
00:00:08.7 --> 00:00:12.420
Democratic People's Republic of Korea

4
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.820
the only country in the world named

5
00:00:12.42 --> 00:00:16.619
quite so ironically you may know it's

6
00:00:14.82 --> 00:00:18.090
better as North Korea

7
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
it sounds democratic as they come free

8
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:21.930
ruled by the same family for 17 years

9
00:00:19.89 --> 00:00:23.910
can be the head of state has been

10
00:00:21.93 --> 00:00:26.640
inherited through three generations of

11
00:00:23.91 --> 00:00:30.000
the portly Kim family Kim Il Sung Kim

12
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:32.040
jong-il and now kim jeong-hoon and in

13
00:00:30.0 --> 00:00:34.110
keeping with this perfectly democratic

14
00:00:32.04 --> 00:00:36.480
tradition the leader of North Korea is

15
00:00:34.11 --> 00:00:39.360
called not president not king but

16
00:00:36.48 --> 00:00:42.500
Supreme Leader you know just like any

17
00:00:39.36 --> 00:00:42.500
normal democracy

18
00:00:44.77 --> 00:00:48.370
so what can we really say at our North

19
00:00:47.05 --> 00:00:50.290
Koreans that you haven't heard before

20
00:00:48.37 --> 00:00:52.390
well it is one of the most brutal

21
00:00:50.29 --> 00:00:54.489
dictatorships in the whole world where

22
00:00:52.39 --> 00:00:57.280
mass torture execution and extreme

23
00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.170
poverty are common and now you might ask

24
00:00:57.28 --> 00:01:01.210
well why do we care so much about this

25
00:00:59.17 --> 00:01:04.119
country well the answer to that is as

26
00:01:01.21 --> 00:01:06.310
simple as nuclear bombs this is a

27
00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.500
country that is still officially at war

28
00:01:06.31 --> 00:01:10.540
with South Korea and makes a pastime of

29
00:01:08.5 --> 00:01:12.760
threatening Japan and the u.s. with

30
00:01:10.54 --> 00:01:14.410
nuclear annihilation and while that

31
00:01:12.76 --> 00:01:16.119
might have sounded far-fetched at one

32
00:01:14.41 --> 00:01:18.190
point in time with nuclear tests

33
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.350
happening almost every other year people

34
00:01:18.19 --> 00:01:26.950
are starting to take a little old Kim a

35
00:01:20.35 --> 00:01:29.860
bit more seriously but you still might

36
00:01:26.95 --> 00:01:32.229
wonder if North Korea is that dangerous

37
00:01:29.86 --> 00:01:34.690
well why isn't anyone stopping them well

38
00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.610
they've actually tried basically every

39
00:01:34.69 --> 00:01:39.190
sanction you could think of have been

40
00:01:36.61 --> 00:01:41.410
thrown at North Korea instead of that

41
00:01:39.19 --> 00:01:43.660
financial pressure forcing reform north

42
00:01:41.41 --> 00:01:46.600
Korea has just had its diplomats selling

43
00:01:43.66 --> 00:01:49.060
meth out of their embassies worldwide to

44
00:01:46.6 --> 00:01:52.119
shockers very yes indeed there are North

45
00:01:49.06 --> 00:01:54.430
Korean embassies and - yes indeed they

46
00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.770
were selling drugs out of them but

47
00:01:54.43 --> 00:01:59.080
there's one country that still calls

48
00:01:56.77 --> 00:02:01.720
North Korea a friends and that country

49
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:04.420
is China they even have a treaty called

50
00:02:01.72 --> 00:02:07.950
the sino North Korean mutual aid and

51
00:02:04.42 --> 00:02:07.950
cooperation friendship treaty

52
00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.300
China and North Korea are as close to

53
00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.550
each other as lips are to teeth China

54
00:02:13.3 --> 00:02:17.560
and to a lesser extent Russia have been

55
00:02:15.55 --> 00:02:20.140
the only things propping up the North

56
00:02:17.56 --> 00:02:22.330
Korean regime so damn us give China a

57
00:02:20.14 --> 00:02:23.890
lot of sway over kim jeong-hoon right

58
00:02:22.33 --> 00:02:25.480
well that's what the international

59
00:02:23.89 --> 00:02:27.489
community sought and that's how China

60
00:02:25.48 --> 00:02:29.530
came to be seen as the only country the

61
00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.140
world could turn Singh in order to rein

62
00:02:29.53 --> 00:02:34.330
in North Korea's nuclear ambitions

63
00:02:32.14 --> 00:02:36.160
but well not so fast because things they

64
00:02:34.33 --> 00:02:37.599
are changing and China is starting to

65
00:02:36.16 --> 00:02:40.980
get a rather annoyed at their little

66
00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.980
brothers Tom Marie

67
00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.110
so the question today is what's behind

68
00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.660
the cooling relationship between China

69
00:02:47.11 --> 00:02:51.700
and North Korea and what consequences

70
00:02:49.66 --> 00:02:52.180
could this have on the future of the

71
00:02:51.7 --> 00:02:53.500
country

72
00:02:52.18 --> 00:02:55.840
joining us today to answer these

73
00:02:53.5 --> 00:02:57.610
questions is the biggest China expert on

74
00:02:55.84 --> 00:02:59.680
YouTube yes the viewer we are talking

75
00:02:57.61 --> 00:03:02.049
about Chris Chappell the host of China

76
00:02:59.68 --> 00:03:04.060
uncensored hello Simon and hello to all

77
00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.530
our friends at visual politics so

78
00:03:04.06 --> 00:03:07.989
relations between these two communist

79
00:03:05.53 --> 00:03:09.640
brothers have deteriorated so much the

80
00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.650
China and North Korea are in the middle

81
00:03:09.64 --> 00:03:16.359
of a war of work basically China said

82
00:03:14.65 --> 00:03:19.570
that it would work with the evil

83
00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.180
imperialist you know the us to combat

84
00:03:19.57 --> 00:03:23.980
North Korea's nuclear program then North

85
00:03:22.18 --> 00:03:26.049
Korean state run media responded that

86
00:03:23.98 --> 00:03:28.450
China should really think about how its

87
00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.640
reckless act of chopping down the pillar

88
00:03:28.45 --> 00:03:33.880
of North Korea China relations could

89
00:03:30.64 --> 00:03:35.769
have grave consequences and then Chinese

90
00:03:33.88 --> 00:03:38.260
favor and media responded with a not so

91
00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.790
subtle threat to end their alliance so

92
00:03:38.26 --> 00:03:41.290
why is that they all they stabbing each

93
00:03:39.79 --> 00:03:44.069
other in the back well we're going to

94
00:03:41.29 --> 00:03:44.069
look at that right now

95
00:03:44.67 --> 00:03:49.890
chyna friends owns North Korea China and

96
00:03:48.0 --> 00:03:51.989
North Korea really makes the perfect

97
00:03:49.89 --> 00:03:53.790
best friend they have much in common

98
00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.590
they share a border they both had

99
00:03:53.79 --> 00:03:57.750
communist uprisings and they have

100
00:03:55.59 --> 00:03:59.880
installed leaders who have radical views

101
00:03:57.75 --> 00:04:01.440
of Marxism the People's Republic of

102
00:03:59.88 --> 00:04:03.239
China and the Democratic People's

103
00:04:01.44 --> 00:04:05.760
Republic of Korea really are like the

104
00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.459
Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez

105
00:04:05.76 --> 00:04:09.870
of international politics especially

106
00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.190
like we're doing a movie or something

107
00:04:09.87 --> 00:04:13.260
doing you're with Robert is just the

108
00:04:11.19 --> 00:04:15.330
idea that that's that year I get to hang

109
00:04:13.26 --> 00:04:17.250
out with Robert now China does more than

110
00:04:15.33 --> 00:04:19.049
just give North Korea financial aid

111
00:04:17.25 --> 00:04:20.639
China has also made big loans of the

112
00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.410
North Korean regime so they can build

113
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.360
railroads and highways and they're

114
00:04:22.41 --> 00:04:28.139
pretty forgiving when Pyongyang can't

115
00:04:24.36 --> 00:04:30.570
pay back its debt and then there's oil

116
00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.430
for decades China was the main source of

117
00:04:30.57 --> 00:04:36.320
Dino juice to North Korea

118
00:04:32.43 --> 00:04:36.320
plus there's military cooperation

119
00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.719
going to help train North Korean hackers

120
00:04:40.28 --> 00:04:45.180
hackers who've now become a threat to

121
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.849
the international community including

122
00:04:45.18 --> 00:04:50.520
China and what does Beijing get in

123
00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.129
exchange well North Korea is a cheap

124
00:04:50.52 --> 00:04:55.020
labor paradise in fact many products

125
00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:00.210
with the made in China label should

126
00:04:55.02 --> 00:05:02.400
actually say made in DPRK brilliant

127
00:05:00.21 --> 00:05:04.319
sportswear brand Rip Curl made a public

128
00:05:02.4 --> 00:05:06.120
apology this week after it emerged that

129
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.949
some of its key gear had been made in

130
00:05:06.12 --> 00:05:09.949
one of North Korea state owned factories

131
00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.359
but hold on a minute because things are

132
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.519
starting to change the Chinese Communist

133
00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:19.739
Party today is a little less interested

134
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.479
in the global spread of communism and a

135
00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:24.089
little more interested in becoming a

136
00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.609
global superpower and North Korea is

137
00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.589
well they're really cramping China's

138
00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:30.179
style imagine how hard it is to be cool

139
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.189
with America when your good buddy North

140
00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:35.039
Korea keeps threatening to blow them up

141
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:36.959
but this is not the end of the story

142
00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.359
sixteen years ago China and North Korea

143
00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:41.399
were pretty similar but today things are

144
00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:43.469
quite different terrorists came to see

145
00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.769
closely is the misery experienced by

146
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.239
their North Korean neighbors

147
00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:50.399
I'm not old but I feel like what I can

148
00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:52.109
see over there is similar to the very

149
00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:54.389
difficult time that our nation had in

150
00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:56.759
the past a lot of North Korean citizens

151
00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.369
would do whatever it takes in order to

152
00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.049
cross the Chinese border and Beijing is

153
00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.779
scared what could become a refugee

154
00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.409
crisis similar to that of Syria if this

155
00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:06.809
wasn't enough

156
00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.669
Pyongyang's diplomacy hasn't been all

157
00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.919
that diplomatic with its own allies

158
00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.599
here's a little snub courtesy of Kim

159
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.599
jong-un in 2015

160
00:06:17.61 --> 00:06:22.840
in all-female North Korean pop bands

161
00:06:20.44 --> 00:06:24.670
formed by leader Kim jong-un abruptly

162
00:06:22.84 --> 00:06:28.180
canceled a Beijing concert on Saturday

163
00:06:24.67 --> 00:06:31.230
and headed back home to Pyongyang

164
00:06:28.18 --> 00:06:31.230
[Music]

165
00:06:33.27 --> 00:06:37.690
unfortunately February 2017 became the

166
00:06:36.07 --> 00:06:39.550
breaking points for this friendship

167
00:06:37.69 --> 00:06:41.200
North Korea launching some ballistic

168
00:06:39.55 --> 00:06:44.500
missiles are conducting some nuclear

169
00:06:41.2 --> 00:06:46.960
tests is nothing new but what is due is

170
00:06:44.5 --> 00:06:48.670
the degree to which China is willing to

171
00:06:46.96 --> 00:06:50.980
criticize it this is happening at a time

172
00:06:48.67 --> 00:06:52.690
when Chinese leader Xi Jinping is trying

173
00:06:50.98 --> 00:06:54.700
to improve his relationship with the

174
00:06:52.69 --> 00:07:02.290
United States and of course Kourtney

175
00:06:54.7 --> 00:07:04.120
Pyongyang this is a stab in the back it

176
00:07:02.29 --> 00:07:05.890
triggered the war hoards between these

177
00:07:04.12 --> 00:07:06.670
two countries with state-run media in

178
00:07:05.89 --> 00:07:09.070
both countries

179
00:07:06.67 --> 00:07:09.940
criticizing the other but again this is

180
00:07:09.07 --> 00:07:11.740
not the end of the story

181
00:07:09.94 --> 00:07:13.570
remember those Chinese trained North

182
00:07:11.74 --> 00:07:15.520
Korean hackers that allegedly hit

183
00:07:13.57 --> 00:07:17.950
several Hollywood studios two years ago

184
00:07:15.52 --> 00:07:23.170
well if you lay down with dogs don't be

185
00:07:17.95 --> 00:07:24.910
surprised if you wake up with fleas the

186
00:07:23.17 --> 00:07:27.460
wave of so-called ransomware attacks

187
00:07:24.91 --> 00:07:29.920
that began Friday have struck China hard

188
00:07:27.46 --> 00:07:31.840
if North Korea is responsible even

189
00:07:29.92 --> 00:07:34.240
unintentionally it would be the first

190
00:07:31.84 --> 00:07:36.190
known attempt by Pyongyang to digitally

191
00:07:34.24 --> 00:07:38.290
pilfer China's coffers at such a scale

192
00:07:36.19 --> 00:07:40.690
in other words by keeping things the

193
00:07:38.29 --> 00:07:43.210
same North Korea is about to lose their

194
00:07:40.69 --> 00:07:45.610
biggest ally the only country willing to

195
00:07:43.21 --> 00:07:47.500
defend them in case of war and this is a

196
00:07:45.61 --> 00:07:52.140
war even if just for propaganda reasons

197
00:07:47.5 --> 00:07:52.140
a lot of people would love to start

198
00:07:52.19 --> 00:07:56.700
[Music]

199
00:07:53.93 --> 00:07:58.380
and Trump come in I I know what you're

200
00:07:56.7 --> 00:08:01.320
thinking all assignment list is quite a

201
00:07:58.38 --> 00:08:06.410
story and I need Batman Putin to become

202
00:08:01.32 --> 00:08:06.410
a true visual politic video so well

203
00:08:08.39 --> 00:08:12.900
Russia has already taken over the supply

204
00:08:10.92 --> 00:08:15.000
of jet fuel to North Korea after China

205
00:08:12.9 --> 00:08:16.740
halted exports two years ago according

206
00:08:15.0 --> 00:08:18.510
to the industry sources in China Russia

207
00:08:16.74 --> 00:08:20.400
and North Korea also have a lot of

208
00:08:18.51 --> 00:08:22.890
things in common apart from sharing a

209
00:08:20.4 --> 00:08:30.810
border they both have strong attractive

210
00:08:22.89 --> 00:08:32.430
and manly leaders and in both countries

211
00:08:30.81 --> 00:08:34.680
human rights are considered optional

212
00:08:32.43 --> 00:08:36.420
Russia and North Korea just started a

213
00:08:34.68 --> 00:08:38.460
ferry service to connect their two

214
00:08:36.42 --> 00:08:40.620
countries so Russian companies can be

215
00:08:38.46 --> 00:08:43.140
regularly stopped with a North Korean

216
00:08:40.62 --> 00:08:45.270
slave workforce does that mean Putin and

217
00:08:43.14 --> 00:08:47.820
Kim are now Betsey's well what if all

218
00:08:45.27 --> 00:08:53.010
because Kim jong-un has a rather funny

219
00:08:47.82 --> 00:08:56.790
concept of true love North Korea

220
00:08:53.01 --> 00:08:57.120
launches a missile near Russian sea all

221
00:08:56.79 --> 00:09:00.030
right

222
00:08:57.12 --> 00:09:01.770
listen Kim jong-un dude this is really

223
00:09:00.03 --> 00:09:03.060
not the way you make friends and as you

224
00:09:01.77 --> 00:09:05.430
might imagine with things like this

225
00:09:03.06 --> 00:09:08.400
Russia may not be too quick to become

226
00:09:05.43 --> 00:09:09.900
North Korea's unconditional Ally and so

227
00:09:08.4 --> 00:09:12.210
for the first time in its history the

228
00:09:09.9 --> 00:09:14.610
most hated country has run out of allies

229
00:09:12.21 --> 00:09:16.230
and this is where Donald Trump steps

230
00:09:14.61 --> 00:09:18.870
into the picture we have a big problem

231
00:09:16.23 --> 00:09:21.090
we have somebody that is not doing the

232
00:09:18.87 --> 00:09:23.250
right thing and that's going to be my

233
00:09:21.09 --> 00:09:25.530
responsibility this comes at a time when

234
00:09:23.25 --> 00:09:27.690
China is trying to work on a new trade

235
00:09:25.53 --> 00:09:29.640
deal with the United States at the same

236
00:09:27.69 --> 00:09:32.090
time that Donald Trump is facing a lot

237
00:09:29.64 --> 00:09:35.010
of pressure at home

238
00:09:32.09 --> 00:09:37.230
so the question is now will Donald Trump

239
00:09:35.01 --> 00:09:39.150
be taking responsibility for North Korea

240
00:09:37.23 --> 00:09:41.370
to improve his image in the United

241
00:09:39.15 --> 00:09:43.290
States could this be the end of the

242
00:09:41.37 --> 00:09:44.940
North Korean dictatorship well you can
