1
00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:11.099
a lot of people are wondering these days

2
00:00:09.63 --> 00:00:13.980
whether it's possible to put the word

3
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.109
Islam in the same sentence as democracy

4
00:00:13.98 --> 00:00:17.880
and human right and to tell you the

5
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.920
truth there are not that many examples

6
00:00:17.88 --> 00:00:22.080
to be optimistic about even in a country

7
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:24.449
like Turkey where they have a guarantee

8
00:00:22.08 --> 00:00:27.630
of the separation of church and state

9
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.970
they are still moving towards an Islamic

10
00:00:27.63 --> 00:00:32.369
theocracy nevertheless there is one

11
00:00:29.97 --> 00:00:38.219
country that is escaping this trend and

12
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.070
that country is Tunisia with

13
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.719
approximately 10 million inhabitants

14
00:00:40.07 --> 00:00:45.510
Tunisia is the cradle of the so-called

15
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.329
Arab Spring you know that phenomena that

16
00:00:45.51 --> 00:00:50.160
started in the winter of 2011 anyway if

17
00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.050
this is where everything started more

18
00:00:50.16 --> 00:00:54.420
specifically things started in the city

19
00:00:52.05 --> 00:00:56.280
of City boses things kicked off when a

20
00:00:54.42 --> 00:00:58.410
26 year old fruit seller earned himself

21
00:00:56.28 --> 00:01:00.449
to death as a form of protest in front

22
00:00:58.41 --> 00:01:02.940
of a government building this is how a

23
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.250
revolution spread all across northern

24
00:01:02.94 --> 00:01:07.860
Africa

25
00:01:05.25 --> 00:01:09.510
and from here you probably do know the

26
00:01:07.86 --> 00:01:11.370
rest of the story in Egypt they

27
00:01:09.51 --> 00:01:13.380
overthrew their dictator only them to be

28
00:01:11.37 --> 00:01:16.080
replaced by a man who is probably even

29
00:01:13.38 --> 00:01:17.970
worse Libya is a failed state that has a

30
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:20.430
high probability of becoming a radical

31
00:01:17.97 --> 00:01:22.380
Islamic country and well Lester says

32
00:01:20.43 --> 00:01:24.510
probably best that we don't talk about

33
00:01:22.38 --> 00:01:27.000
Syria among all of this madness though

34
00:01:24.51 --> 00:01:29.520
Tunisia is an exception after resting

35
00:01:27.0 --> 00:01:31.710
their dictator Abidine Ben Ali Tunisians

36
00:01:29.52 --> 00:01:34.290
wrote a brand new constitution which was

37
00:01:31.71 --> 00:01:36.330
inspired by French law this new text

38
00:01:34.29 --> 00:01:39.090
allows freedom of speech and the freedom

39
00:01:36.33 --> 00:01:40.440
of religion but not only that now 20% of

40
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:43.170
the country's parliamentary seats

41
00:01:40.44 --> 00:01:44.880
occupied by women this is a very big

42
00:01:43.17 --> 00:01:50.100
achievement if you consider Tunisia

43
00:01:44.88 --> 00:01:51.810
through any other Islamic country this

44
00:01:50.1 --> 00:01:54.720
is why Tunisia has become one of the

45
00:01:51.81 --> 00:01:56.340
main targets of - so far more than 73

46
00:01:54.72 --> 00:01:58.440
people have died in three separate

47
00:01:56.34 --> 00:02:00.960
terrorist attacks and this is what leads

48
00:01:58.44 --> 00:02:02.820
us to many questions can Tunisia and

49
00:02:00.96 --> 00:02:05.190
liberal democracies survive in such a

50
00:02:02.82 --> 00:02:07.170
harsh environment can Tunisia become a

51
00:02:05.19 --> 00:02:09.299
model for neighboring countries will the

52
00:02:07.17 --> 00:02:11.130
European Union help or damage this

53
00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.750
democracy well today we are going to

54
00:02:11.13 --> 00:02:14.730
answer all of these questions for you

55
00:02:12.75 --> 00:02:17.780
but first we need to look a bit at the

56
00:02:14.73 --> 00:02:17.780
history of Tunisia

57
00:02:17.98 --> 00:02:24.800
light and shadows of a BBA Ben Ali in

58
00:02:22.04 --> 00:02:25.550
1955 Tunisia got its independence from

59
00:02:24.8 --> 00:02:27.470
France

60
00:02:25.55 --> 00:02:29.629
just like other countries in the region

61
00:02:27.47 --> 00:02:32.870
the republic of tunisia followed the

62
00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.239
so-called Arab socialism or pan-arabism

63
00:02:32.87 --> 00:02:37.519
this was an ideological cocktail the

64
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.590
mixed authoritarianism charismatic

65
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.230
leaders a centralized economy and

66
00:02:39.59 --> 00:02:44.720
finally a secular state you might even

67
00:02:42.23 --> 00:02:46.760
say it's an anti-religious state this

68
00:02:44.72 --> 00:02:48.590
ideology became very fashionable in the

69
00:02:46.76 --> 00:02:52.900
area that brought us tyrants such as

70
00:02:48.59 --> 00:02:52.900
Gaddafi in Libya and Nasser in Egypt

71
00:02:53.87 --> 00:02:58.680
in the Keynesian case the man is Manny

72
00:02:56.52 --> 00:03:00.599
you are seeing on the screen now his

73
00:02:58.68 --> 00:03:02.459
name it was happy before Weber in

74
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.590
summary his government was famous for

75
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.760
its corruption in summary his government

76
00:03:04.59 --> 00:03:08.069
was famous for its corruption

77
00:03:05.76 --> 00:03:09.840
clientelism and its systemic

78
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.870
devaluations of the national currency

79
00:03:09.84 --> 00:03:15.180
the dinar it's really no wonder the

80
00:03:12.87 --> 00:03:17.670
economy eventually collapsed and so what

81
00:03:15.18 --> 00:03:19.380
was the outcome well in 1987 president

82
00:03:17.67 --> 00:03:21.090
Borg Revo was at the hospital recovering

83
00:03:19.38 --> 00:03:23.010
from a heart attack it was at this point

84
00:03:21.09 --> 00:03:25.200
that his prime minister Abidine Ben Ali

85
00:03:23.01 --> 00:03:27.360
took his seat June is Ian's called this

86
00:03:25.2 --> 00:03:28.799
event the medical coup d'etat no blood

87
00:03:27.36 --> 00:03:31.319
was spilled and actually there was no

88
00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.269
violence whatsoever even when Borg Weber

89
00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.340
left the hospital Ben Ali sent into a

90
00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.790
luxury mansion with a team of doctors

91
00:03:35.34 --> 00:03:40.730
and nurses to take care of him

92
00:03:37.79 --> 00:03:42.650
[Music]

93
00:03:40.73 --> 00:03:45.110
legend even says that he went to visit

94
00:03:42.65 --> 00:03:47.030
the man often so you can say that this

95
00:03:45.11 --> 00:03:48.769
was a coup d'etat that you can say that

96
00:03:47.03 --> 00:03:51.680
it was one with a lot of love and care

97
00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.330
so what did Ben Ali do well during his

98
00:03:51.68 --> 00:03:56.269
mandate he said that he would bring

99
00:03:53.33 --> 00:03:58.190
democracy to Tunisia and while he did

100
00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.410
call for election several times the

101
00:03:58.19 --> 00:04:02.390
problem was that in order to run in the

102
00:04:00.41 --> 00:04:04.640
elections you needed the approval of 30

103
00:04:02.39 --> 00:04:06.860
people from the existing government

104
00:04:04.64 --> 00:04:10.010
party this means that in most of the

105
00:04:06.86 --> 00:04:11.629
cases well surprise surprise the only

106
00:04:10.01 --> 00:04:13.280
eligible candidate was one from the

107
00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.299
government party

108
00:04:13.28 --> 00:04:19.609
[Music]

109
00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.970
thanks to all of this Ben Ali held power

110
00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.889
for 23 years 23 years but of course

111
00:04:22.97 --> 00:04:26.930
continued the tradition of corruption

112
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.639
that the Tunisian people have grown used

113
00:04:26.93 --> 00:04:31.220
to but now there is something positive

114
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:37.400
we should say la mr. Ben Ali and that is

115
00:04:31.22 --> 00:04:38.780
his economic magnitude from the start of

116
00:04:37.4 --> 00:04:40.610
his rule he encouraged foreign

117
00:04:38.78 --> 00:04:41.960
investment in this encouraged a lot of

118
00:04:40.61 --> 00:04:44.210
foreign companies to establish

119
00:04:41.96 --> 00:04:45.979
themselves in Tunisia this is housed

120
00:04:44.21 --> 00:04:47.720
several hotel chains started up in the

121
00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.030
country attracted by the great weather

122
00:04:47.72 --> 00:04:52.280
this led to tourism becoming to Nazir's

123
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:53.990
main industry followed by the olive

124
00:04:52.28 --> 00:04:55.130
industry and don't forget the latter of

125
00:04:53.99 --> 00:04:57.680
those because we're going to be coming

126
00:04:55.13 --> 00:04:59.780
back to it shortly so during those 20

127
00:04:57.68 --> 00:05:02.659
years humans actually managed to

128
00:04:59.78 --> 00:05:05.210
multiplying their income by 3 in fact in

129
00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.550
2010 that unity have boosted over 6

130
00:05:05.21 --> 00:05:11.809
million tourists

131
00:05:06.55 --> 00:05:14.129
[Music]

132
00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:16.199
this is about half the number who

133
00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.999
visited neighboring Egypt but do you

134
00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.249
keep in mind here that Egypt has well

135
00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.469
the pyramids and also a population nine

136
00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.360
times the size of Tunisia paying close

137
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.849
attention to the numbers here Tunisia

138
00:05:24.36 --> 00:05:29.099
has a population of 10 million people

139
00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.460
and in a single year

140
00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.169
they hosted 6 million tourists so why am

141
00:05:32.46 --> 00:05:35.969
i emphasizing this quite so much

142
00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.830
well that's because tourists are much

143
00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.569
more than an influx of money for the

144
00:05:37.83 --> 00:05:41.669
country they also bring with them

145
00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.439
another culture suddenly in a country

146
00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.149
which is majority Islam it becomes

147
00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:47.159
normal for people to see women walking

148
00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.779
around without scarves on their heads so

149
00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.460
I'm a sexual people to be seen kissing

150
00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.259
in the streets and for people to be

151
00:05:50.46 --> 00:05:54.419
drinking alcohol there is no other

152
00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.699
Islamic country that is quite so exposed

153
00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.110
to this level of Western culture so if

154
00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.059
you are one of those British people who

155
00:05:58.11 --> 00:06:01.979
got drunken age unity and hotel well

156
00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:04.589
know that you're doing your part for

157
00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.089
Tunisia's cultural diversity well thanks

158
00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:09.830
to this wider cultural exposure

159
00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:14.069
something quite extraordinary happened

160
00:06:09.83 --> 00:06:16.949
this democratic transition in Tunisia in

161
00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:20.310
2010 the Tunisian economy was on fire

162
00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.229
but the unemployment rate with 12% added

163
00:06:20.31 --> 00:06:24.870
to this work corruption scandals and

164
00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.099
power abuses under Ben Ali's regime now

165
00:06:24.87 --> 00:06:27.569
all of these things were of course

166
00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.580
hidden from the people in the local

167
00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.289
press but due to the large amount of

168
00:06:29.58 --> 00:06:33.060
tourists a lot of foreign media was

169
00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.949
being brought into the country and this

170
00:06:33.06 --> 00:06:36.719
educated the people now all of these

171
00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.939
things would never be published in the

172
00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.009
local press but the foreign media they

173
00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.990
were reporting everything and in a

174
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.120
country with so much tourism what is

175
00:06:42.99 --> 00:06:47.969
written outside can very easily be read

176
00:06:45.12 --> 00:06:50.490
inside so people knew what was going on

177
00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:52.620
and they really didn't like it this led

178
00:06:50.49 --> 00:06:54.689
to demonstrations being organized in

179
00:06:52.62 --> 00:06:56.309
several cities perhaps these projects

180
00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.949
wouldn't have been so big if it wasn't

181
00:06:56.309 --> 00:07:00.930
for Mohamed Bouazizi it was a 26 year

182
00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.789
old man who burned himself to death in

183
00:07:00.93 --> 00:07:04.370
protest after police took over his

184
00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.490
Street shop

185
00:07:04.37 --> 00:07:08.210
you

186
00:07:04.49 --> 00:07:10.720
[Music]

187
00:07:08.21 --> 00:07:13.520
this is how the Jasmine Revolution

188
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:15.830
started all of a sudden thousands of

189
00:07:13.52 --> 00:07:18.560
protesters gathered in every Tunisian

190
00:07:15.83 --> 00:07:20.720
city now unlike other dictators Ben Ali

191
00:07:18.56 --> 00:07:27.139
didn't confront them decently left

192
00:07:20.72 --> 00:07:30.229
Tunisia generally quits after 23 years

193
00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.240
in power and leaves Tunisia after this

194
00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.250
momentous occasion the presidents of the

195
00:07:32.24 --> 00:07:36.289
Parliament of Tunisia formed a

196
00:07:34.25 --> 00:07:38.750
provisional government and freed over

197
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.460
500 political prisoners not only that

198
00:07:38.75 --> 00:07:42.410
but some Tunisian dissidents who were

199
00:07:40.46 --> 00:07:44.210
living in exile came back to the country

200
00:07:42.41 --> 00:07:46.669
among them the one this man

201
00:07:44.21 --> 00:07:48.470
Montez Mizuki he was the president of

202
00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.630
the Arab Commission on Human Rights a

203
00:07:48.47 --> 00:07:52.789
lot of ashoka mukpo sue Roy question you

204
00:07:50.63 --> 00:07:56.240
might wonder now is whether the Tunisia

205
00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:59.570
we're talking Islamic and the answer is

206
00:07:56.24 --> 00:08:01.820
no the Tunisia were talking a team of

207
00:07:59.57 --> 00:08:03.650
private so a year after Boas easily

208
00:08:01.82 --> 00:08:05.870
burned himself to death Tunisia was

209
00:08:03.65 --> 00:08:07.729
holding their first free election and

210
00:08:05.87 --> 00:08:10.070
our friends marzocchi would become the

211
00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:10.699
first president so what exactly wasn't

212
00:08:10.07 --> 00:08:12.740
the problem

213
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:15.159
well the president was from the Islamist

214
00:08:12.74 --> 00:08:15.159
party

215
00:08:17.03 --> 00:08:21.500
we are talking about the another

216
00:08:19.22 --> 00:08:23.210
movement the Tunisian and perhaps more

217
00:08:21.5 --> 00:08:25.520
moderate version of the Islamic

218
00:08:23.21 --> 00:08:27.590
Brotherhood any time when over 100

219
00:08:25.52 --> 00:08:29.780
political parties appeared in order with

220
00:08:27.59 --> 00:08:31.820
the only one with inefficient structure

221
00:08:29.78 --> 00:08:33.860
this is why the party won the majority

222
00:08:31.82 --> 00:08:35.960
of the seats in the Tunisian Parliament

223
00:08:33.86 --> 00:08:37.310
this is particularly problematic if we

224
00:08:35.96 --> 00:08:39.140
take into account that this was the

225
00:08:37.31 --> 00:08:41.360
party that was going to be responsible

226
00:08:39.14 --> 00:08:46.400
for crafting the new Tunisian

227
00:08:41.36 --> 00:08:48.350
Constitution so you might be wondering

228
00:08:46.4 --> 00:08:51.110
after this how is it that the Tunisian

229
00:08:48.35 --> 00:08:52.760
Constitution that remains so secular

230
00:08:51.11 --> 00:08:58.880
well here's the story

231
00:08:52.76 --> 00:08:58.880
[Music]

232
00:08:59.94 --> 00:09:04.620
after so much political uncertainty the

233
00:09:02.74 --> 00:09:07.330
hardcore Islamists created the so-called

234
00:09:04.62 --> 00:09:09.130
Islamic League these of course supported

235
00:09:07.33 --> 00:09:11.230
the ruling party in order to speed up

236
00:09:09.13 --> 00:09:13.240
the islamification of the country this

237
00:09:11.23 --> 00:09:20.160
led to violence on the streets and even

238
00:09:13.24 --> 00:09:23.140
word and Misha shocked by assassination

239
00:09:20.16 --> 00:09:25.390
opposition leaders Mohamed Brahmi and

240
00:09:23.14 --> 00:09:27.940
Chakri meanwhile the income from tourism

241
00:09:25.39 --> 00:09:30.130
was falling sharply no one wants to

242
00:09:27.94 --> 00:09:32.800
travel to a dangerous country and this

243
00:09:30.13 --> 00:09:34.900
generated more and more social unrest

244
00:09:32.8 --> 00:09:37.300
with this situation the secular parties

245
00:09:34.9 --> 00:09:39.280
created a common front against in order

246
00:09:37.3 --> 00:09:41.140
and this is how the Islamist bloc was

247
00:09:39.28 --> 00:09:42.070
forced to have secular politicians in

248
00:09:41.14 --> 00:09:43.930
their cabinet

249
00:09:42.07 --> 00:09:45.430
months later both the Islamists League's

250
00:09:43.93 --> 00:09:47.650
and the Muslim Brotherhood were

251
00:09:45.43 --> 00:09:49.660
considered terrorist organizations by

252
00:09:47.65 --> 00:09:51.550
the Tunisian government and of course

253
00:09:49.66 --> 00:09:52.720
the most extreme politicians had to

254
00:09:51.55 --> 00:09:54.730
leave the government as well

255
00:09:52.72 --> 00:09:56.320
actually in some month the whole in our

256
00:09:54.73 --> 00:09:58.240
the movement to left the cabinet and

257
00:09:56.32 --> 00:09:59.990
left the decision-making power in the

258
00:09:58.24 --> 00:10:02.590
hands of a secular party

259
00:09:59.99 --> 00:10:05.180
[Music]

260
00:10:02.59 --> 00:10:07.670
they did this with just one condition

261
00:10:05.18 --> 00:10:09.500
and that is that Islam must remain the

262
00:10:07.67 --> 00:10:11.450
official religion in the new

263
00:10:09.5 --> 00:10:13.160
constitution so what was the result of

264
00:10:11.45 --> 00:10:15.290
all of this well the new Tunisian

265
00:10:13.16 --> 00:10:17.390
Constitution is not based on Sharia law

266
00:10:15.29 --> 00:10:19.250
and it includes both freedom of religion

267
00:10:17.39 --> 00:10:22.070
and freedom of speech but not only that

268
00:10:19.25 --> 00:10:24.710
it also guarantees a non-religious

269
00:10:22.07 --> 00:10:27.530
education Islam now holds only a

270
00:10:24.71 --> 00:10:28.820
symbolic position in Tunisia the reality

271
00:10:27.53 --> 00:10:32.120
is that when it comes to politics

272
00:10:28.82 --> 00:10:34.250
Tunisia is a secular nation new free

273
00:10:32.12 --> 00:10:36.290
media organizations were then formed and

274
00:10:34.25 --> 00:10:38.600
what followed this was the creation of

275
00:10:36.29 --> 00:10:41.060
one of the strongest civil societies in

276
00:10:38.6 --> 00:10:42.890
the whole of North Africa after this it

277
00:10:41.06 --> 00:10:44.390
is no surprise that during the elections

278
00:10:42.89 --> 00:10:46.520
in 2014

279
00:10:44.39 --> 00:10:51.740
Islamist parties lost to the secular

280
00:10:46.52 --> 00:10:53.390
liberal coalition now if you still then

281
00:10:51.74 --> 00:10:55.580
believe me about the influence of

282
00:10:53.39 --> 00:10:57.830
tourism in Tunisia well I'll have a look

283
00:10:55.58 --> 00:10:59.540
at this electoral map on this map you

284
00:10:57.83 --> 00:11:01.640
can see how the Islamists lost in the

285
00:10:59.54 --> 00:11:03.260
regions that are closer to the coast and

286
00:11:01.64 --> 00:11:05.420
business because that's where all the

287
00:11:03.26 --> 00:11:07.730
hotels and resorts are but hold on a

288
00:11:05.42 --> 00:11:11.870
second because things are about to get a

289
00:11:07.73 --> 00:11:15.020
little greener who is threatening

290
00:11:11.87 --> 00:11:17.270
Tunisian democracy months after Tunisia

291
00:11:15.02 --> 00:11:19.190
published their constitution - or the

292
00:11:17.27 --> 00:11:21.140
Islamic state organized their first

293
00:11:19.19 --> 00:11:23.450
terrorist attack against the Alvaro

294
00:11:21.14 --> 00:11:26.160
museum this is one of the main tourist

295
00:11:23.45 --> 00:11:29.320
attractions in the country

296
00:11:26.16 --> 00:11:32.020
as a result the number of British

297
00:11:29.32 --> 00:11:35.410
arrivals which look set to break records

298
00:11:32.02 --> 00:11:38.200
in the early months of 2015 has fallen

299
00:11:35.41 --> 00:11:40.720
by ninety three point two percent for

300
00:11:38.2 --> 00:11:42.340
the first five months of this year after

301
00:11:40.72 --> 00:11:44.950
this two attacks followed and in total

302
00:11:42.34 --> 00:11:46.870
73 people were left dead this is why the

303
00:11:44.95 --> 00:11:49.360
Jean is Ian government has a security

304
00:11:46.87 --> 00:11:50.890
crisis as well as an economic crisis and

305
00:11:49.36 --> 00:11:52.810
one of them is destroying their main

306
00:11:50.89 --> 00:11:58.930
industry which is why stories like this

307
00:11:52.81 --> 00:12:00.940
one are quite so important janeshia

308
00:11:58.93 --> 00:12:03.670
to offer fifty billion dollars of

309
00:12:00.94 --> 00:12:05.260
projects to foreign investors not only

310
00:12:03.67 --> 00:12:07.720
that but the European Union has also

311
00:12:05.26 --> 00:12:09.460
eliminated all fares on the import of

312
00:12:07.72 --> 00:12:11.620
Tunisian olive oil as you know in the

313
00:12:09.46 --> 00:12:13.630
European Union agriculture is protected

314
00:12:11.62 --> 00:12:15.790
from foreign markets but in the case of

315
00:12:13.63 --> 00:12:17.890
Tunisia it is essential in order to

316
00:12:15.79 --> 00:12:19.930
support their aulet industry as I said

317
00:12:17.89 --> 00:12:22.120
before it is the second largest industry

318
00:12:19.93 --> 00:12:23.500
in the country behind tourism but hold

319
00:12:22.12 --> 00:12:25.270
on for a moment because as you can

320
00:12:23.5 --> 00:12:27.400
probably imagine this didn't make the

321
00:12:25.27 --> 00:12:31.900
European farmers too happy especially

322
00:12:27.4 --> 00:12:36.310
those ones based in it its favor of

323
00:12:31.9 --> 00:12:38.080
quality say no to Tunisian oil well this

324
00:12:36.31 --> 00:12:40.390
is especially funny given that most of

325
00:12:38.08 --> 00:12:42.580
that oil that is labeled album made in

326
00:12:40.39 --> 00:12:44.980
Italy is actually produced in Tunisia

327
00:12:42.58 --> 00:12:47.800
and then shipped to Italy where it is

328
00:12:44.98 --> 00:12:50.230
labeled and this is where the political

329
00:12:47.8 --> 00:12:52.300
battle starts in in Europe on the one

330
00:12:50.23 --> 00:12:54.100
hand it is crucial to help the Tunisian

331
00:12:52.3 --> 00:12:56.560
economy so they can maintain their

332
00:12:54.1 --> 00:12:58.510
democracy but on the other hand a lot of

333
00:12:56.56 --> 00:13:01.440
European countries don't want to lose

334
00:12:58.51 --> 00:13:01.440
their privileges

335
00:13:02.92 --> 00:13:08.170
so the question is do you think Europe

336
00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:10.119
should open its market to Tunisia do you

337
00:13:08.17 --> 00:13:11.949
think that it is important sacrifice to

338
00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:14.170
make in order to prevent political

339
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:15.639
unrest in the country and do you think

340
00:13:14.17 --> 00:13:17.499
Tunisia could become a model for

341
