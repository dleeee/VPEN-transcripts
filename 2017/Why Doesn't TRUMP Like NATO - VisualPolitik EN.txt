3
00:00:06.89 --> 00:00:11.790
the alliance between the United States

4
00:00:09.33 --> 00:00:14.280
and the European countries is not

5
00:00:11.79 --> 00:00:16.049
exactly having its best moments right

6
00:00:14.28 --> 00:00:17.609
now Thermal trump has made quite an

7
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.380
entrance and it is jeopardize the

8
00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.199
relationship of these nations to an

9
00:00:19.38 --> 00:00:24.029
extent that they could even possibly

10
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.029
breakup we have seen that with the Paris

11
00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.090
agreement make our planet

12
00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.489
great again and also with Donald Trump's

13
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:35.340
position towards NATO the most powerful

14
00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.710
military organisation in history and I

15
00:00:35.34 --> 00:00:43.500
never asked what what the new NATO

16
00:00:40.71 --> 00:00:45.840
headquarters cost I refused to do that

17
00:00:43.5 --> 00:00:47.820
in this video we're going to focus on

18
00:00:45.84 --> 00:00:49.980
this organization we're going to look at

19
00:00:47.82 --> 00:00:52.440
what's happening with NATO why Donald

20
00:00:49.98 --> 00:00:54.870
Trump is criticizing it so much and what

21
00:00:52.44 --> 00:00:57.270
the future is for this organization but

22
00:00:54.87 --> 00:00:58.980
before we get into any of that let's get

23
00:00:57.27 --> 00:01:01.500
some perspective

24
00:00:58.98 --> 00:01:03.770
[Music]

25
00:01:01.5 --> 00:01:05.489
NATO of look back

26
00:01:03.77 --> 00:01:07.560
[Music]

27
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.200
shortly after the end of World War two

28
00:01:07.56 --> 00:01:13.079
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

29
00:01:10.2 --> 00:01:15.630
took its first steps it was born in 1949

30
00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.270
with a very clear mission restrain that

31
00:01:15.63 --> 00:01:20.549
stopped and if needed defeat the Soviet

32
00:01:18.27 --> 00:01:22.979
Union the Cold War had just started and

33
00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.390
there was an atmosphere of tension the

34
00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.830
Berlin Blockade had already taken place

35
00:01:24.39 --> 00:01:27.600
and the Czech Communist Party had

36
00:01:25.83 --> 00:01:30.090
completely taken control with a coup

37
00:01:27.6 --> 00:01:31.979
d'etat at that time nobody knew what was

38
00:01:30.09 --> 00:01:34.649
going to happen and the possibility of

39
00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.570
war was very very real so let's take a

40
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.549
look at the historical context the world

41
00:01:36.57 --> 00:01:40.619
had just gone through world war two

42
00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.470
Europe was destroyed and there was an

43
00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.759
absolute distrust on both sides the

44
00:01:43.47 --> 00:01:46.200
truth is there's a war wouldn't have

45
00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.509
been a surprise and that was the

46
00:01:46.2 --> 00:01:52.049
situation which existed when NATO was

47
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.759
born the beginning NATO was formed by

48
00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.250
the United States Canada and ten

49
00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.959
European countries France Italy the

50
00:01:56.25 --> 00:02:00.600
United Kingdom Belgium the Netherlands

51
00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.640
Luxembourg Denmark Norway Iceland and

52
00:02:00.6 --> 00:02:04.799
Portugal a few years later the federal

53
00:02:02.64 --> 00:02:07.470
public of Germany or western Germany was

54
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.780
added to that list the original purpose

55
00:02:07.47 --> 00:02:11.910
of the idea this spirit so to speak was

56
00:02:09.78 --> 00:02:13.290
to bring forces together if a member

57
00:02:11.91 --> 00:02:15.090
comes she was attacked it was seen as if

58
00:02:13.29 --> 00:02:17.430
all the members had been attacked as

59
00:02:15.09 --> 00:02:20.700
well all for one and one for all right

60
00:02:17.43 --> 00:02:23.320
well yes but also not quite because

61
00:02:20.7 --> 00:02:28.760
there was quite a lot of small prints

62
00:02:23.32 --> 00:02:34.560
[Music]

63
00:02:28.76 --> 00:02:37.019
NATO after the Cold War however that all

64
00:02:34.56 --> 00:02:39.870
changed in 1991 the fall of the Soviet

65
00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.700
Union left NATO with no clear purpose

66
00:02:39.87 --> 00:02:43.590
without an enemy what is the point of

67
00:02:41.7 --> 00:02:46.620
the alliance that is a question many

68
00:02:43.59 --> 00:02:49.140
people asked and many still do today but

69
00:02:46.62 --> 00:02:51.120
wait one second because against all odds

70
00:02:49.14 --> 00:02:53.069
it was actually after the fall of the

71
00:02:51.12 --> 00:02:57.769
Soviet Union that the organization

72
00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.769
started to play a more active role and

73
00:02:59.9 --> 00:03:04.829
it has taken action quite frequently

74
00:03:02.31 --> 00:03:07.349
since then this includes Serbia Kosovo

75
00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.420
Afghanistan Libya control over the

76
00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.519
Baltic Sea against piracy in the Indian

77
00:03:09.42 --> 00:03:14.519
Ocean and recently support for the fight

78
00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.190
against Isis it was also during this

79
00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.900
time when more new countries signed up

80
00:03:17.19 --> 00:03:21.359
since it started in corporations have

81
00:03:18.9 --> 00:03:24.870
been regular but since 1991 in

82
00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.480
corporations have really sped up next be

83
00:03:24.87 --> 00:03:29.700
49 there were 12 countries in NATO today

84
00:03:27.48 --> 00:03:31.829
there are 28 many of these countries are

85
00:03:29.7 --> 00:03:33.590
from the old Warsaw Pact a similar thing

86
00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.870
to NATO but led by the Soviet Union

87
00:03:33.59 --> 00:03:36.870
[Music]

88
00:03:37.95 --> 00:03:44.190
and Putin's Russia has never liked that

89
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:45.989
in fact the war of 2008 between Russia

90
00:03:44.19 --> 00:03:48.330
and Georgia took place partly because

91
00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.580
Georgia wanted to become a member of

92
00:03:48.33 --> 00:03:53.190
NATO and something similar has happened

93
00:03:50.58 --> 00:03:55.350
in the Ukraine and after the recent

94
00:03:53.19 --> 00:03:57.810
crisis in Ukraine and the clash between

95
00:03:55.35 --> 00:03:59.980
them and Russia NATO seems to have sped

96
00:03:57.81 --> 00:04:09.790
up again

97
00:03:59.98 --> 00:04:13.400
[Music]

98
00:04:09.79 --> 00:04:15.620
also in 2016 an immediate action force

99
00:04:13.4 --> 00:04:17.419
was set up this is made of five thousand

100
00:04:15.62 --> 00:04:21.680
soldiers capable of deploying very

101
00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:24.110
quickly and in almost any place the so

102
00:04:21.68 --> 00:04:26.150
called spearhead force has five thousand

103
00:04:24.11 --> 00:04:28.220
soldiers that are part of a larger Rapid

104
00:04:26.15 --> 00:04:30.320
Action Force of forty thousand soldiers

105
00:04:28.22 --> 00:04:32.360
in order to coordinate its deployments

106
00:04:30.32 --> 00:04:35.419
the Alliance has created since September

107
00:04:32.36 --> 00:04:37.099
2014 eight support headquarters in all

108
00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.050
the countries that used to be under

109
00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:44.120
Soviet influence I think 2017 the United

110
00:04:42.05 --> 00:04:46.340
States made the largest troop deployment

111
00:04:44.12 --> 00:04:50.030
in Europe since the Cold War following a

112
00:04:46.34 --> 00:04:52.070
NATO mission thousands of US troops

113
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:54.979
arrived in Europe in one of the largest

114
00:04:52.07 --> 00:04:56.750
deployments since the Cold War we are

115
00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.940
talking about more than 4,000 soldiers

116
00:04:56.75 --> 00:05:00.889
and hundreds of tanks and armored

117
00:04:58.94 --> 00:05:03.080
vehicles already being deployed in

118
00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.970
Eastern Europe on a mission that reminds

119
00:05:03.08 --> 00:05:07.310
us of the initial mission of NATO to

120
00:05:04.97 --> 00:05:09.770
discourage Russia from any expansionist

121
00:05:07.31 --> 00:05:11.949
temptations however despite all of this

122
00:05:09.77 --> 00:05:15.020
activity the role of NATO is skill

123
00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:17.229
uncertain and the United States is still

124
00:05:15.02 --> 00:05:21.430
unhappy with the commitments from the

125
00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:23.560
organization's European partners

126
00:05:21.43 --> 00:05:27.010
[Music]

127
00:05:23.56 --> 00:05:28.360
the anger of the United States as we

128
00:05:27.01 --> 00:05:30.430
were saying earlier on the mutual

129
00:05:28.36 --> 00:05:32.920
defense guarantee yes a member of NATO

130
00:05:30.43 --> 00:05:35.200
is attacked is not as clear as it seems

131
00:05:32.92 --> 00:05:38.290
take a look at article 5 the one that

132
00:05:35.2 --> 00:05:40.270
regulates this situation the parties

133
00:05:38.29 --> 00:05:42.340
agreed that an armed attack against one

134
00:05:40.27 --> 00:05:44.680
or more of them shall be considered an

135
00:05:42.34 --> 00:05:46.690
attack against them all and consequently

136
00:05:44.68 --> 00:05:49.030
they agree that if such an attack occurs

137
00:05:46.69 --> 00:05:51.520
each of them will assist the party or

138
00:05:49.03 --> 00:05:53.850
parties so attacked by taking forthwith

139
00:05:51.52 --> 00:05:56.740
such actions as it deems necessary

140
00:05:53.85 --> 00:05:59.590
including the use of armed force article

141
00:05:56.74 --> 00:06:02.320
5 of the North Atlantic Treaty including

142
00:05:59.59 --> 00:06:04.480
the use of armed force this means that

143
00:06:02.32 --> 00:06:06.190
if a country were to suffer an attack it

144
00:06:04.48 --> 00:06:08.800
doesn't mean the rest have to give

145
00:06:06.19 --> 00:06:10.090
immediate military support and that is

146
00:06:08.8 --> 00:06:12.730
why all of the presidents of the United

147
00:06:10.09 --> 00:06:14.890
States since Harry Truman have taken

148
00:06:12.73 --> 00:06:17.620
advantage of the first NATO meeting they

149
00:06:14.89 --> 00:06:21.210
attended to interpret article 5 as a

150
00:06:17.62 --> 00:06:21.210
commitment of military force

151
00:06:23.55 --> 00:06:27.790
however Donald Trump hasn't he was

152
00:06:26.26 --> 00:06:29.890
expected to do so during the

153
00:06:27.79 --> 00:06:32.050
inauguration of a monument for victims

154
00:06:29.89 --> 00:06:34.270
of 9/11 in Brussels where he attended

155
00:06:32.05 --> 00:06:36.490
his first NATO meeting indeed he was

156
00:06:34.27 --> 00:06:38.500
asked to do so by the European countries

157
00:06:36.49 --> 00:06:40.780
the White House said that they were but

158
00:06:38.5 --> 00:06:42.910
a final commitment was not forthcoming

159
00:06:40.78 --> 00:06:44.950
there are analysts that think this is a

160
00:06:42.91 --> 00:06:46.990
major issue and they refer to this as

161
00:06:44.95 --> 00:06:49.180
one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes

162
00:06:46.99 --> 00:06:50.560
of all time other analysts don't think

163
00:06:49.18 --> 00:06:53.080
this is so important but what is

164
00:06:50.56 --> 00:06:55.479
undeniable is that this had not been

165
00:06:53.08 --> 00:06:57.880
well received in Europe especially for

166
00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.950
these reasons up until now the only

167
00:06:57.88 --> 00:07:02.530
country which is invoked article 5 was

168
00:06:59.95 --> 00:07:04.150
the United States they did it after 9/11

169
00:07:02.53 --> 00:07:07.120
and they received immediate support from

170
00:07:04.15 --> 00:07:09.040
all members of NATO the thing is that

171
00:07:07.12 --> 00:07:11.140
Trump didn't want to offer support and

172
00:07:09.04 --> 00:07:13.210
actually he took advantage of his speech

173
00:07:11.14 --> 00:07:15.479
to recriminate the alleged lack of

174
00:07:13.21 --> 00:07:17.950
commitments by his European allies

175
00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:20.169
dissing the Europeans while dedicating a

176
00:07:17.95 --> 00:07:24.130
monument to remember the 888 European

177
00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:26.229
158 Canadian and 2396 American troops

178
00:07:24.13 --> 00:07:27.870
who died in Afghanistan took some doing

179
00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.570
Tomas Rey

180
00:07:27.87 --> 00:07:31.290
let's Trump is not the only one angry

181
00:07:30.57 --> 00:07:33.330
about it

182
00:07:31.29 --> 00:07:35.639
Obama me on the same opinion and the

183
00:07:33.33 --> 00:07:38.490
question is now why is the United States

184
00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.470
so angry at NATO well basically because

185
00:07:38.49 --> 00:07:42.690
they claim that the European members of

186
00:07:40.47 --> 00:07:49.800
NATO are not committed enough or don't

187
00:07:42.69 --> 00:07:51.510
spend enough money as a rule all NATO

188
00:07:49.8 --> 00:07:53.430
members are committed to spending at

189
00:07:51.51 --> 00:07:56.550
least two percent of their GDP on

190
00:07:53.43 --> 00:07:58.020
defense however only a few countries are

191
00:07:56.55 --> 00:08:00.300
meeting this commitment these include

192
00:07:58.02 --> 00:08:03.630
the United Kingdom Poland Estonia Greece

193
00:08:00.3 --> 00:08:05.250
and of course the United States the rest

194
00:08:03.63 --> 00:08:07.410
well they're quite some way from

195
00:08:05.25 --> 00:08:08.880
spending that amount just take a look at

196
00:08:07.41 --> 00:08:11.370
what Trump's Secretary of Defense James

197
00:08:08.88 --> 00:08:14.340
mattis has to say about the European

198
00:08:11.37 --> 00:08:16.560
country Americans cannot care more for

199
00:08:14.34 --> 00:08:19.050
your children's future security than you

200
00:08:16.56 --> 00:08:20.970
do now wait a second because does this

201
00:08:19.05 --> 00:08:23.160
mean that the European countries don't

202
00:08:20.97 --> 00:08:25.770
spend money on a defense well that's

203
00:08:23.16 --> 00:08:27.840
certainly not the case in fact if we add

204
00:08:25.77 --> 00:08:29.639
up all of the budgets of all European

205
00:08:27.84 --> 00:08:31.830
countries that are members of NATO these

206
00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:33.990
countries spend two hundred and fifty

207
00:08:31.83 --> 00:08:35.969
billion dollars every year so if these

208
00:08:33.99 --> 00:08:38.159
countries were one it would be the

209
00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:41.039
country with the second-highest military

210
00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.659
spending after only the United States so

211
00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.670
if it's money we're talking about it's

212
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.530
not that spending has been reduced or at

213
00:08:44.67 --> 00:08:48.630
least not relative to these threats of

214
00:08:46.53 --> 00:08:50.940
the world is currently facing find that

215
00:08:48.63 --> 00:08:53.990
pretty difference and we don't live with

216
00:08:50.94 --> 00:08:53.990
the Soviet Union anymore

217
00:08:55.72 --> 00:09:03.370
an obsession of the United States let us

218
00:09:00.819 --> 00:09:05.350
say it loud and clear the world has

219
00:09:03.37 --> 00:09:07.720
changed and we are facing different

220
00:09:05.35 --> 00:09:10.060
difficulties than we were in the 1960s

221
00:09:07.72 --> 00:09:11.860
the risks today is not the possibility

222
00:09:10.06 --> 00:09:14.379
of a Great War this risk has been

223
00:09:11.86 --> 00:09:16.660
reduced by globalization trade and

224
00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:19.000
mutually assured destruction the threats

225
00:09:16.66 --> 00:09:22.000
we face today can be found in terrorism

226
00:09:19.0 --> 00:09:24.250
piracy cyber warfare and the risk of the

227
00:09:22.0 --> 00:09:26.920
proliferation of weapons of mass

228
00:09:24.25 --> 00:09:29.050
destruction so must we fight these risks

229
00:09:26.92 --> 00:09:31.689
well certainly but this is something

230
00:09:29.05 --> 00:09:33.399
that we won't accomplish with more tanks

231
00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:35.470
we also need to consider that we are

232
00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:37.660
dealing with a very different kind of

233
00:09:35.47 --> 00:09:40.060
war today something known as hybrid

234
00:09:37.66 --> 00:09:44.230
warfare where combat isn't like what it

235
00:09:40.06 --> 00:09:46.000
was in old movies modern wars are more

236
00:09:44.23 --> 00:09:48.250
and more often about guerrillas and

237
00:09:46.0 --> 00:09:50.199
groups aimed at destabilizing nation

238
00:09:48.25 --> 00:09:52.209
further there is political pressure

239
00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:54.160
economic penalties cyber warfare

240
00:09:52.209 --> 00:09:57.129
interference in election processes

241
00:09:54.16 --> 00:10:02.889
intelligence operations etc etc that

242
00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:07.509
make war much more complicated the

243
00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:09.850
mistakes of Europe one thing is clear

244
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:12.250
NATO numbers are not doing everything

245
00:10:09.85 --> 00:10:14.350
right on the one hand the organization

246
00:10:12.25 --> 00:10:16.420
has established more sensible conditions

247
00:10:14.35 --> 00:10:18.309
20% of the budget should be spent in

248
00:10:16.42 --> 00:10:20.319
equipment and here even European

249
00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:22.779
countries which spend more on soldiers

250
00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:25.029
than they need still aren't meeting this

251
00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:27.100
requirement on the other hand European

252
00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:29.170
countries are still quite disorganized

253
00:10:27.1 --> 00:10:31.240
and use very different systems which

254
00:10:29.17 --> 00:10:34.149
makes production maintenance and

255
00:10:31.24 --> 00:10:37.059
deployment more and more expensive just

256
00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:39.279
have a look at ones with tanks the

257
00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:41.949
United States primarily uses one kind of

258
00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:45.600
tank the Abrams tank while Europeans use

259
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:45.600
up to 19 different models

260
00:10:45.68 --> 00:10:49.260
imagine the chaos when a joint

261
00:10:47.55 --> 00:10:50.730
deployment has to be organized

262
00:10:49.26 --> 00:10:53.279
they can't even share the same

263
00:10:50.73 --> 00:10:55.410
replacement equipment and well the same

264
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:57.839
is true for much more than just tanks

265
00:10:55.41 --> 00:11:00.810
and so the final question is can NATO

266
00:10:57.839 --> 00:11:02.730
play a significant role in the future in

267
00:11:00.81 --> 00:11:05.850
our opinion here of visual politics yes

268
00:11:02.73 --> 00:11:08.279
they absolutely can but only after a bit

269
00:11:05.85 --> 00:11:09.959
of a perspective shift we feel that

270
00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:11.820
countries can spend money better and

271
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.890
actually share resources rather than

272
00:11:11.82 --> 00:11:15.390
just spending more even though that

273
00:11:13.89 --> 00:11:17.700
might have said some military

274
00:11:15.39 --> 00:11:19.920
contractors well now we'd like to know

275
00:11:17.7 --> 00:11:22.110
your opinion what should the future of

276
00:11:19.92 --> 00:11:23.820
NATO be do you think that the European

277
00:11:22.11 --> 00:11:25.860
countries should meet to the us's

278
00:11:23.82 --> 00:11:28.110
demands or do you think NATO should

279
00:11:25.86 --> 00:11:29.880
focus less on conventional warfare or

280
00:11:28.11 --> 00:11:31.589
maybe you think NATO should just

281
00:11:29.88 --> 00:11:34.200
dissolve let us know what you think in

282
00:11:31.589 --> 00:11:36.209
