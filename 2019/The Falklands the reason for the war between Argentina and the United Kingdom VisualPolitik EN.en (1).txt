3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,870
so the New York Times has just published

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,960
its list of must-see places for 2019 and

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,820
nestled quietly in the top 25

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,800
destinations is none other than the

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,910
Falkland Islands

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,380
[Music]

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,400
but we're not talking about a tropical

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,660
paradise here we're talking about a

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,279
remote archipelago in the South Atlantic

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,099
more than 700 islands exposed to the

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,169
harsh elements with a tiny population of

14
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:33,300
just 3,000 people it's a territory as

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,070
empty as it is in hospitable

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,260
nevertheless this windblown backwater

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,329
was the cause of intense political

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,220
tension in the second half of the 20th

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,680
century culminating in a war between the

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,409
United Kingdom and Argentina why until

21
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,000
the Islanders have made it perfect it

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,430
there these islands are British

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,640
they are the Queen's loyal subjects they

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,210
wishing to stay that way it's important

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,979
to understand here the four Argentinians

26
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,200
the Falkland Islands is a national issue

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
Argentinian children learn very very

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,369
early that the Falklands are a part of

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:12,750
Argentina for them the British

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,850
occupation of the islands was nothing

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:31,760
more than Imperial plunder

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,850
[Applause]

00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,400
[Music]

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,380
so given its controversial history the

35
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,300
New York Times list sparked a few

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,730
questions do the Falkland Islands belong

37
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,530
to Argentina and why are they so

38
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,990
important to mainland residents after

39
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,270
all Argentina is a huge country in fact

40
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,920
the eighth largest country in the world

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,750
so why all the fuss about this remote

42
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,520
inhospitable and largely uninhabited

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,010
archipelago well this video aims to

44
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,500
answer these questions the first things

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,520
first let's find out how it all began

[Music]

49
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,060
the origin of an endless dispute the

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,650
beginning of the 19th century the

51
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,420
Spanish colonies in America begin to

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,489
protest against Spanish rule the recent

53
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,810
United States Declaration of

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,730
Independence and the French Revolution

55
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,799
of ignited the desire for autonomy and

56
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:31,519
freedom that cannot be suppressed in

57
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,650
1808 the Napoleonic invasion of Spain

58
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,329
are led to the dismantling of Madrid's

59
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,730
power and that kicked off a race towards

60
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,620
independence that more or less resulted

61
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,639
in Latin America as we know it today the

62
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,739
server was that on May the 25th 1810

63
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,299
just two years after the French

64
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,010
occupation of Spain the Municipal

65
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,659
Council of the city of Buenos Aires

66
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,269
decided to replace the Viceroy of Rio de

67
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,430
la Plata with the first government of

68
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,650
genset Argentinians today think of this

69
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,870
as their first patriotic government

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,400
Argentina was on its own Rhodes

71
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,139
Revolution but it wouldn't be free of

72
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,299
Spain until six years later on July the

73
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,669
9th 1816 came the proclamation of

74
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,650
Independence of the United Provinces of

75
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,079
the Rio de la Plata and this is where

76
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,740
the first confusion arises

77
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,069
[Music]

78
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,120
you see many people think that the

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,769
Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata

80
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,680
created in 1776 by King Carlos the third

81
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,870
of Spain was synonymous with what we

82
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,120
know of as Argentina today but this

83
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,349
wasn't the case

84
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,120
let me explain while it is true that the

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,890
Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata

86
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,750
included modern-day Argentina

87
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,819
it also included Uruguay Bolivia and

88
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,180
Paraguay

89
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,940
[Music]

90
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,870
all right so somewhere you might now be

91
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,670
thinking well hang on Simon when of the

92
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,680
Falklands fit into all of this well the

93
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
factors that Uruguay Paraguay and

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,849
Bolivia along with the Falkland Islands

95
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,069
were all part of the Viceroyalty of the

96
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,079
Rio de la Plata and the thing is I don't

97
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,579
think you'll find many Argentinians

98
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,379
claiming sovereignty over Paraguay

99
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,959
Bolivia or Uruguay these days and of

100
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,159
course if they did everyone would think

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,769
they were crazy so well why the

102
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,810
Falklands the fact that the Falklands

103
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,760
were part of this mammoth Viceroyalty

104
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,470
which belonged to the Spanish crown is

105
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,480
not really surprising what is surprising

106
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,910
is Argentina's claim on the Falklands

107
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,440
especially given that until this

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,389
territory was consolidated as a British

109
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,220
sovereignty it was passed back and forth

110
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,050
between European powers numerous times

111
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,880
[Music]

112
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,080
from hand to hand from play to play the

113
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,430
history of the Falkland Islands is

114
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,710
actually much simpler and shorter than

115
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,360
many people think you see until the mid

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,610
1700s the Falkland Islands weren't even

117
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,440
inhabited on a permanent basis indeed

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,669
the first people to live there

119
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,860
permanently were not the British or the

120
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,750
Spanish but the French yep you heard

121
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,550
that right it was the French who first

122
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,930
permanently inhabited the Falkland

123
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,360
Islands but that is only the start

124
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,560
between 1764 and 1833 the islands passed

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,810
from one nation to another first from

126
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,820
France to Spain then to England then

127
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,010
back to Spain and finally since 1833 the

128
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,690
Falklands have been under British

129
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,560
sovereignty

130
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,220
[Music]

131
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,750
so let's do some quick addition since

132
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,280
they began to be permanently occupied

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,870
the Falklands have been under Spanish

134
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,270
sovereignty for just over 40 years and

135
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,190
under British sovereignty for more than

136
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,840
a hundred and eighty so why does

137
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,510
Argentina stake its claim quite so

138
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,460
vigorously well it all goes back to the

139
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,320
time between the may Revolution and the

140
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,180
subsequent Declaration of Independence

141
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,310
of the United Provinces of the Rio de la

142
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,230
Plata at that time the local authorities

143
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,640
began sending expeditions to the

144
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,560
Falklands Islands which they considered

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,170
their own and this is precisely where

146
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,480
the controversy arose because while the

147
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,370
Argentinian version insists that the

148
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,870
English snatched part of their territory

149
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,780
in 1833 the truth is that at the time

150
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,400
Argentina was still a work in progress

151
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,430
and its borders were far from defined

152
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,440
and if you're not convinced I'll check

153
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,420
this out just five years before the

154
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,680
British returned to the Falklands in

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,620
1833 Argentina lost Uruguay what's more

156
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,200
it took until 1862 that's almost three

157
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
decades later for Argentina to have a

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,990
national president

159
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,310
in other words in 1833

160
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,230
when the English regains control over

161
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,210
the Falklands Argentina's borders were

162
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,500
yet to be decided there was no

163
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,750
Argentinian national governments and so

164
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,730
of course they had nothing like a

165
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,190
national army in fact it may seem hard

166
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,170
to believe that between the years 1852

167
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,120
and 1860 the state of awareness Aires

168
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,130
wasn't even part of the Argentine

169
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,270
Confederation but in the grand scheme of

170
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,580
things this isn't so extraordinary

171
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,620
stories rely on the continuous changes

172
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,420
in rules of the game viewed through a

173
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,850
historical prism sovereignties come and

174
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,310
they go all the time now is clear that

175
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,290
history can be framed and interpreted in

176
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,280
many different ways

177
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,810
and that may explain why many

178
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,550
Argentinians insist that when the

179
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,170
English reasserted control over the

180
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,510
Falklands in 1833 the islands were

181
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,850
already a part of Argentina as we know

182
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,280
it today and therefore are a part of the

183
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,530
Argentinian permanent but let's see

184
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,720
because 190 years later can you guess

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,610
how many people of Argentinian origin

186
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,560
live on the Falkland Islands today that

187
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,230
would be 18 in fact there are almost 10

188
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,300
times as many inhabitants from Chile as

189
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,220
there are from Argentina nevertheless

190
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,620
not so long ago the contested

191
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,070
sovereignty it was grounds for war

192
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,939
[Music]

193
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:44,789
an unexpected war ever since the British

194
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,739
regains control of the Falkland Islands

195
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,989
Argentina has wanted them back it's been

196
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,849
like a national obsession through the

197
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,829
generations in 1888 they began

198
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,569
publishing maps that included these

199
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,639
previously disregarded islands within

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,929
Argentina's and borders now let's just

201
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,339
be clear that apart from the map

202
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,199
redesign there were no great claims on

203
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,879
the Falklands from either side until the

204
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,469
Second World War happens or then

205
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,569
Argentina in England's work two friendly

206
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,039
allies in fact the latin-american

207
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,659
country that received the most direct

208
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,489
and indirect investments from England

209
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:19,439
was Argentina but after the Second World

210
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,009
War

211
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,659
everything changed for one thing

212
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:22,979
commercial relations between the

213
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,019
countries were no longer as significant

214
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,969
secondly the election of general puranas

215
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,949
Argentina's president gave weight to his

216
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:30,299
nationalist and anti imperialist

217
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,729
discourse and thirdly the newly created

218
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,709
United Nations was focused on the

219
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,330
process of decolonization

220
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,570
in fact UN resolution 2:06 5 invited

221
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,580
Argentina in the UK to clear up the

222
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,290
matter of the Falklands sovereignty in

223
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,779
1965 but within two years of this

224
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,550
resolution the situation had taken a

225
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,130
hundred and eighty degree turn in 1967

226
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,570
London told the Argentinian government

227
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,579
that it was willing to cede sovereignty

228
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,380
over the Falklands but on one condition

229
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,959
they had to respect the wishes of the

230
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,940
CalPERS or the Falkland Island

231
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,680
inhabitants the only problem was that

232
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,420
the CalPERS opposed any sovereignty

233
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,399
transfer point blank in fact they

234
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,899
actively mobilized against the

235
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,760
possibility by creating what became

236
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,230
known as the Falklands Lobby and it

237
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,700
seems that at the time the British

238
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,620
government was willing to deliver or at

239
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,329
least share sovereignty over the

240
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,190
Falklands in exchange for commercial

241
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,050
agreements so let me stress here that it

242
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,120
was the islands inhabitants themselves

243
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,079
who prevented this in the mid-1960s

244
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,329
pragmatism would have probably led the

245
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,800
British government to transfer the

246
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,930
sovereignty of the Falklands had not the

247
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,149
Falklands Lobby arisen to counter the

248
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,040
pressure of Argentine demands

249
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,230
Clive Ellerbe an English researcher

250
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,660
author of the work role of the Falklands

251
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,820
Lobby and that is how things stood on

252
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:56,160
April the 2nd 1982

253
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,580
[Music]

254
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,870
[Applause]

255
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,790
[Music]

256
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,180
[Applause]

257
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,100
[Music]

258
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,560
on that day a grim military government's

259
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,840
led by General Leopoldo Galtieri held

260
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,610
power in Argentina it was they

261
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,680
discredited and repressive regime

262
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,150
without the people's support and

263
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,710
responsible for one of the darkest

264
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,720
periods in Argentina's modern history

265
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,370
many citizens were branded political

266
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,050
prisoners and thousands more simply

267
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,420
disappeared and a huge economic crisis

268
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,370
it was crippling the economy on that day

269
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,470
galti aires government made a fateful

270
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,270
decision gained the people's support by

271
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,220
feeding it their patriotic fervor and

272
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,810
with that the argentinian government

273
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,640
decided to invade and occupy the

274
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,180
Falkland Islands the Argentinian

275
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,130
authorities expected this move to spur a

276
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,930
diplomatic agreements with the UK

277
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,420
however they underestimated this woman's

278
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,020
determination

279
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,000
Margaret Thatcher the Prime Minister of

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,800
the United Kingdom was willing to fight

281
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,350
a war thousands of kilometres away the

282
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,020
outcome will it was disastrous people of

283
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,970
the Falkland Islands like the people of

284
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,060
the United Kingdom are an island race

285
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,100
their way of life is British their

286
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,130
allegiance is to the crown they are few

287
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,290
in number but they have the right to

288
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,899
live in peace to choose their own way of

289
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,089
life and to determine their own

290
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:36,500
Allegiance

291
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,880
the British Army's technological and

292
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,529
military superiority couples with the

293
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:41,970
Argentinean government's lack of

294
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,740
planning they carried out the invasion

295
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,329
with many young poorly equipped and

296
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,769
poorly trained soldiers allowed the

297
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,540
United Kingdom to recover the islands in

298
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,000
a little over two months so once again a

299
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,290
tyrannical government's political

300
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,480
decision ended with a war as unnecessary

301
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,000
as it was useless costing the lives of

302
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,950
hundreds of people

303
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,089
and look we know how sensitive these

304
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,460
types of border issues can be and with

305
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,930
this video we want to put some facts on

306
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,670
the table and maybe give you a new

307
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,080
perspective because throughout history

308
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,330
territories have passed from one power

309
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,670
to another for more than 300 years what

310
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,350
is now Argentina was under Spanish rule

311
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,420
for more than 180 years the Falklands

312
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,830
have been British but what does it

313
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,080
matter who was and wasn't right 200

314
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,520
years ago there's an it more important

315
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,990
to think about where we are today and

316
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,700
try and build a more harmonious future

317
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,890
just a little reflection from us a

318
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,480
visual politic now here are some more

319
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,430
questions why is this so much interest

320
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,589
in the Falklands what's special about

321
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:36,240
these islands these are topics we're

322
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,770
going to address in an upcoming video

323
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,930
here on a visual politic but before we

324
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,040
go we'd really like to hear your

325
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,020

to the Falklands comment section should

327
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,290
