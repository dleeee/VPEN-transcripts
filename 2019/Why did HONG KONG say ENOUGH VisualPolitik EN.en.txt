2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,820
thank today's sponsor Skillshare

by a guy called Thomas Frank who's also

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,410

it's a win-win and let's get into it

32
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:12,950
[Applause]

33
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,200
it's a fact China is hot right now the

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,970
Beijing regime's influence over the

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,920
world has never been as great as it is

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,899
today and the same applies to China's

37
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,270
fame and presence in global media and

38
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,100
you know what the person responsible for

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:37,680
all of that is this man Xi Jingping

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,390
has become the Chinese president with

41
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,429
the most power since the fall of Mao

42
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:44,340
Zedong he came to power in 2013 with two

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,679
great promises on the one hand to expand

44
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,810
China's power and influence over the

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,909
world and on the other to consolidate

46
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,830
the Communist Party's political power

47
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,810
that way the Chinese president seeks to

48
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,729
end the widespread belief that economic

49
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:58,619
development is always followed by

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,810
political transitions and democratic

51
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,600
processes but to achieve his goal and

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,880
consolidate his power Xi Jingping needs

53
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,370
first to remove two large pebbles from

54
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,709
his shoe two pebbles he perceives as a

55
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,500
threat to China's cohesion and national

56
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,530
identity yes I am talking about Taiwan

57
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,810
and Hong Kong

58
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,700
and it's precisely the second one Hong

59
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,080
Kong which we're going to be talking

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:37,410
about in this video

61
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,150
as you probably all know Hong Kong is

62
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,920
currently experiencing the greatest

63
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,930
civil protest since the end of British

64
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,690
colonization and they might also become

65
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,820
the longest protests the trigger the

66
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,480
extradition law you see this law

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
proposed by Hong Kong's chief executive

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,470
Carrie Lam following Beijing's

69
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,820
directives would allow for the

70
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,860
extradition of Hong Kong citizens to be

71
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,200
tried and if applicable imprisoned in

72
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,880
mainland China in other words this

73
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,620
proposed law would recognize the

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,690
validity of the courts controlled by the

75
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,790
Chinese Communist Party and even though

76
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,350
in the ends after pressure from the

77
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,240
protesters the proposed law was

78
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,460
withdrawn it's a clear example of how

79
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,500
things are working in Hong Kong but why

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,300
was this particular proposal the last

81
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,130
straw for the people of Hong Kong what

82
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,170
does Carrie lambs proposal mean are we

83
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,420
witnessing a historical turning point in

84
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,920
the relationship between the former

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,230
colony in China

86
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,660
[Music]

87
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,390
the extradition law the straw that broke

88
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,480
the camel's back that's right the

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,250
extradition law is the proverbial straw

90
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,260
that broke the camel's back because

91
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,730
don't think it all began with this

92
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,380
legislation not at all

93
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,760
Beijing's interference in Hong Kong

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,590
politics and the promotion of pro

95
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,600
Chinese laws by Kong Kong authorities

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,220
which actually emanates from the

97
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,290
continental regime itself the Chinese

98
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,570
regime have been somewhat constant since

99
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,430
the United Kingdom transferred Hong Kong

100
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,370
back to China in 1997 one an example but

101
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,110
I'll check this out let's go back to the

102
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,390
year 2003 just six years after its

103
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,800
transfer to China the Hong Kong

104
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,630
executive proposed the so called

105
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,489
national security law which sought to

106
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:20,930
ban and punish pro-independence

107
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,270
movements Beijing was seeking and I say

108
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,010
seeking because the law was repealed to

109
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,600
shield its sovereignty over the

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,790
territory and stamp out any scrap of

111
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,560
opposition however it didn't let a small

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,390
obstacle get in its way China ran into

113
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,800
fierce opposition from Hong Kong

114
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,330
citizens which took to the streets

115
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,250
leading to the greatest protest in Hong

116
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,570
Kong's history until now

117
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,810
[Music]

118
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,390
yes the protests of this year 2019 have

119
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,970
already far exceeded those of 2003 and

120
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,650
the truth is that there are plenty of

121
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:55,400
reasons why imagine that you live in a

122
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,200
territory with an independent economic

123
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,540
system guaranteed justice into society

124
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,980
with a lot of freedoms such as free

125
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,390
access to the Internet and social

126
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,160
networks and suddenly a dictatorial

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,770
regime with which you don't identify at

128
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,630
all a regime where none of these rights

129
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,730
and freedoms exist in where justice is

130
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,620
controlled by a single party seeks to

131
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,000
impose a law that would allow them to

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
extradite you to be judged under that

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,350
regime with its conditions what would

134
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,050
you do

135
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,640
[Music]

136
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,590
discontent and anger seem far more than

137
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,720
justified wouldn't you think after all

138
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,220
the extradition law even though it

139
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,200
apparently doesn't specifically mention

140
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
political opposition marks the end of

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,919
Hong Kong's model and its autonomy

142
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
because of course it does don't tell me

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,550
it's hard to imagine a Chinese Court

144
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,050
asking for the extradition of a

145
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,060
dissident or political opponent for Hong

146
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,910
Kong for any reason right Hong Kong

147
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,650
extradition laws a death sentence for

148
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,870
Hong Kong says exiled bookseller Lam

149
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,419
winky Beijing will use this law to

150
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,210
control Hong Kong completely freedom of

151
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,220
speech will be lost in the past the

152
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,169
regime kidnapped its critics like me

153
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:05,360
illegally with this law they will abduct

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,090
their critics legally well the fact is

155
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,040
that the discontent is so great that

156
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,660
according to a recent study of the

157
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,580
public opinion program of the university

158
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,229
of hong kong rejection of china has

159
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,090
never been as strong among Hong Kong

160
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,010
citizens as it is now

161
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:30,850
[Music]

162
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,139
but that's not all the worst is the

163
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,400
general feeling that the Hong Kong

164
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,680
executive responds to China's interests

165
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,500
and not those of its own local citizens

166
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,720
[Music]

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,949
and that's a problem in a territory

168
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,750
where citizens cannot change things

169
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,220
because the truth is that democracy

170
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,500
doesn't exist in Hong Kong not all

171
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,060
citizens are allowed to vote and the

172
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,830
government chief executive himself is

173
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,930
proposed by Beijing you see in a normal

174
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,880
democratic and free country if Peru

175
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,770
lured us badly if he or she rules

176
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,539
against the people's interests or is

177
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,370
discovered favoring other interests

178
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,530
people stop voting for that person or

179
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,479
that party and then they can start

180
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,120
undoing the bad policies

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,430
however that can't happen here after

182
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,139
transferring the territory sovereignty

183
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,360
to China the political system turns into

184
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,190
something very very similar to a

185
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,350
corporatist regime that governs for the

186
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,020
interests of two powerful hands on the

187
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,210
one hands that of the Chinese iron fist

188
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,370
and on the other the money filled hands

189
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,260
of the great businessman the faith of

190
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,180
Beijing especially those of the great

191
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,919
real estate tycoons that have managed to

192
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,990
form an oligopoly where Hong Kong is

193
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,880
nothing more than a captive market that

194
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,860
acts the best service

195
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,029
surprised well you shouldn't be in fact

196
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,949
the Hong Kong political system it feeds

197
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:57,360
this model a lot

198
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,739
in fact we've already talked about this

199
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,179
in a previous video where we tell you

200
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,739
why Hong Kong has the most expensive

201
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,779
housing in the world the point is that

202
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,249
in Hong Kong the chief executive the

203
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,019
governmental leader is elected by

204
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,059
members of the election committee which

205
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,969
has about 1200 people and who chooses

206
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:15,219
those 1200 representatives well to be

207
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,259
honest it's easier to start by counting

208
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,389
those who don't vote in us the citizens

209
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,949
we're talking about a very complicated

210
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,229
system in which sectoral organisations

211
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:24,459
religious leaders business leaders

212
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,830
unions and even companies participate

213
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,409
it's all orchestrated to endorse China's

214
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,250
power for example check out what's

215
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,389
happening with the agriculture sector

216
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,279
which is traditionally connected to

217
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,069
Beijing despite only involving 0.1% of

218
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:40,959
Hong Kong's economy farmers hold more

219
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,669
weight in the election committee than

220
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,829
much much more important sectors such as

221
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,839
the financial sector so as you can see

222
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,290
it's all very democratic right

223
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,690
[Music]

224
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,550
in fact the lack of democracy is the

225
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,410
real reason behind the current protests

226
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,990
and bind many past protests because in

227
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,940
spite of the fact that democracy doesn't

228
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,790
technically exist Hong Kong is and has

229
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,920
been a regional epicenter of political

230
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,140
activism and dissent against Beijing for

231
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:15,190
decades and the law of extradition was

232
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,170
the last straw in a process that is

233
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,970
spelling the end of all those freedoms

234
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,560
if you think about it it's the most

235
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,630
dramatic part of it in Hong Kong we are

236
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,730
facing a dictatorship that wants to get

237
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,680
its way we're witnessing people who are

238
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,480
used to living in freedom and who are

239
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,790
watching that freedom slip away every

240
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,210
day and that explains what comes next

241
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,090
[Applause]

242
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,680
[Music]

243
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,809
triple freedom downhill with no brakes

244
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:45,220
that's right in Hong Kong the three

245
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,319
freedoms are in free fall economic

246
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,999
individual and political freedom all

247
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,069
three have worsened since China took

248
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:59,170
over in 1997 and that has consequences

249
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,540
on every level especially in a place

250
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,339
that has been traditionally known for

251
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,050
its scrupulous respect for legal

252
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,819
certainty and institutional stability

253
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:09,939
and that's precisely why around 1,500

254
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,649
multinational companies have their Asian

255
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,869
headquarters in Hong Kong however all of

256
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:15,999
this may end badly not only in the

257
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,740
political fields but also in the

258
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,329
economic field

259
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,829
China's continuous interference is in

260
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:26,740
many cases translating into serious very

261
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,050
serious violations of several company's

262
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,480
legal safety in the economic field China

263
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,949
has increased its blackmailing of

264
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,569
private companies so they'll maintain a

265
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,639
critical stance against any movement

266
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,709
that opposes Beijing that is if they

267
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:39,999
don't want to have any trouble staying

268
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,959
in the big Chinese market

269
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,100
that's what Emmons for example with the

Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific which

271
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,279
suffered the consequences of not being

272
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,259

gesture first of all we aren't even

295
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,420
talking about small isolated cases not

296
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,320
at all

297
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,779
xi Jinping knows that he runs a country

298
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,699
that has one of the most desired markets

299
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,290
for any company worth its salt and

300
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,910
overwhelmingly huge population a growing

00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,160
middle class and consumer power that is

302
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,320
already at exorbitant levels to be in

303
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,149
business in China is to be close to

304
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,279
success and Xi Jingping knows that this

305
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:05,720
is something he can leverage to

306
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,160
politically press people by using

307
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,230
Commerce and the business sector and

308
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,980
that obviously doesn't reassure any

309
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,779
company one misstep and it's all

310
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,730
downhill and also how are they going to

311
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,319
control their employees how can they

312
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:19,670
limit the freedom of expression of

313
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,959
others how can they attract

314
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,610
international talent with such

315
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,100
conditions anyway it starts with bubble

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,660
tea and it ends with any company that

317
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,699
doesn't want to do what China wants and

318
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,829
of course this isn't just reprehensible

319
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,390
it's irresponsible

320
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,380
[Music]

321
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,759
China's attitude along with the blatant

322
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,500
protection of local oligarchs and the

323
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,360
submission of the local governments are

324
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,279
ending Hong Kong's prosperity the people

325
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,990
of Hong Kong they feel like that not

326
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,670
only losing their political freedoms but

327
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,199
also their own economic well-being

328
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,850
because if Hong Kong loses its

329
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,889
independence it's legal certainty its

330
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:54,199
neutrality what's left the worst part is

331
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,209
that Hong Kong may simply stop being

332
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,030

[Music]

334
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,270
so surely you now may understand why the

335
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,070
protests happened and why they've lasted

336
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,000
so long

337
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,590
Hong Kong's society feels like it's

338
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,510
facing one of the last chances to fight

339
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,430
back that it's now or never but if you

340
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,930
want to know why she Jing ping is so

341
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,090
interested in Hong Kong and why despite

342
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,130
all of this China still needs this small

343
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,020
territory or stay tuned because we'll

344
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,820
bring more videos about Hong Kong in

345
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,230
which we'll explain these things and

346
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,150
many others very soon but now it's your

347
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,510
turn

348
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,010
do you think that the pressure from the

349
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,390
people of Hong Kong will help them

350
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,220
regain their political and individual

351
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,810
freedoms will China be able to squash

352
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,400
Hong Kong's languishing political

353
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,050
freedom is this the beginning of the

354
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,270
