3
00:00:07.33 --> 00:00:12.230
Donald Trump President of the United

4
00:00:09.71 --> 00:00:14.059
States and the world the most powerful

5
00:00:12.23 --> 00:00:15.980
man a lot has been said about his anti

6
00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.619
liberal agenda but the question today is

7
00:00:15.98 --> 00:00:20.630
can he really put it all into place the

8
00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.250
bigger question here being how powerful

9
00:00:20.63 --> 00:00:26.330
is the President of the United States

10
00:00:22.25 --> 00:00:28.550
really let's have a look at an example

11
00:00:26.33 --> 00:00:30.439
can Donald Trump get up one morning and

12
00:00:28.55 --> 00:00:32.659
launch a couple of nuclear warheads to

13
00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.210
another country without passing a dork

14
00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.309
Congress Callison is all the Supreme

15
00:00:35.21 --> 00:00:39.440
Court stop the massive deportations that

16
00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.569
he's proposed during his campaign so

17
00:00:39.44 --> 00:00:43.940
forget democracy in the United States

18
00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.609
congratulate Sid self for his clear

19
00:00:43.94 --> 00:00:49.489
distinction between executive judicial

20
00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.530
and legislative branches this system of

21
00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.420
checks and balances was designed to

22
00:00:51.53 --> 00:00:55.879
prevent an eventual psychopath from

23
00:00:53.42 --> 00:00:58.280
taking over the country and creating

24
00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.360
chaos by seizing the power that he was

25
00:00:58.28 --> 00:01:02.050
given by the citizen

26
00:01:00.36 --> 00:01:04.030
[Music]

27
00:01:02.05 --> 00:01:06.220
even with the system in place the

28
00:01:04.03 --> 00:01:08.200
President of the United States or POTUS

29
00:01:06.22 --> 00:01:09.940
has a lot of authority to do things

30
00:01:08.2 --> 00:01:11.770
unilaterally without having to ask

31
00:01:09.94 --> 00:01:14.080
permission of any court of parliament

32
00:01:11.77 --> 00:01:16.720
and believe you me some of these things

33
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:17.980
are pretty darn scary today in this

34
00:01:16.72 --> 00:01:19.450
video we're going to tell you about some

35
00:01:17.98 --> 00:01:21.520
of the things that Donald Trump can do

36
00:01:19.45 --> 00:01:23.260
by himself and we're doing it along with

37
00:01:21.52 --> 00:01:25.780
our friend Eric Fox Eric is the

38
00:01:23.26 --> 00:01:28.210
co-founder of reconsider media one of

39
00:01:25.78 --> 00:01:30.640
the most influential political podcasts

40
00:01:28.21 --> 00:01:34.830
in America hello Simon and hello to all

41
00:01:30.64 --> 00:01:34.830
the visual politics subscribers ah

42
00:01:37.2 --> 00:01:43.149
that's a nuclear football exists the

43
00:01:40.57 --> 00:01:46.240
answer is oh yes it does these circles

44
00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.520
nuclear for fool aka the doomsday button

45
00:01:46.24 --> 00:01:50.110
does exist in fact it's carried in the

46
00:01:48.52 --> 00:01:58.090
briefcase that we're showing in the

47
00:01:50.11 --> 00:02:00.520
picture here when the president presses

48
00:01:58.09 --> 00:02:03.040
that button he's sending in order to to

49
00:02:00.52 --> 00:02:05.920
u.s. army officials usually lieutenants

50
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:07.840
for stationed aboard a combat jet that

51
00:02:05.92 --> 00:02:09.759
has a nuclear weapon each of these

52
00:02:07.84 --> 00:02:12.370
lieutenants has a key when they turn

53
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.990
those keys at the same time they deploy

54
00:02:12.37 --> 00:02:15.990
and launch the nuclear weapon

55
00:02:16.01 --> 00:02:20.880
so now you might be wondering is it

56
00:02:18.27 --> 00:02:23.010
required the Congress passed a law or

57
00:02:20.88 --> 00:02:25.020
some kind of special order in order to

58
00:02:23.01 --> 00:02:27.720
launch that nuke and the answer is a

59
00:02:25.02 --> 00:02:29.790
resounding no the president can give the

60
00:02:27.72 --> 00:02:35.190
order to launch a nuke just about any

61
00:02:29.79 --> 00:02:37.680
time he wants just like a president

62
00:02:35.19 --> 00:02:39.500
could push the button all by himself or

63
00:02:37.68 --> 00:02:43.319
herself legally and constitutionally

64
00:02:39.5 --> 00:02:45.269
speaking basically military personnel

65
00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.420
would need to carry out the strike of

66
00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.790
course any military officer ignoring a

67
00:02:48.42 --> 00:02:53.549
presidential order would be no pending

68
00:02:50.79 --> 00:02:56.450
subordination subject to dismissal and

69
00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.450
court-martial

70
00:02:56.63 --> 00:02:59.840
[Music]

71
00:02:59.99 --> 00:03:04.310
all of this comes from the time of the

72
00:03:02.39 --> 00:03:06.980
Cold War the United States fell

73
00:03:04.31 --> 00:03:08.930
existential II threatened by the Soviet

74
00:03:06.98 --> 00:03:10.550
Union they worried that eventually the

75
00:03:08.93 --> 00:03:13.370
Soviets would be able to nuke any

76
00:03:10.55 --> 00:03:15.620
American city at any time if this would

77
00:03:13.37 --> 00:03:17.840
be the case the United States would need

78
00:03:15.62 --> 00:03:20.030
to be able to react with the retaliatory

79
00:03:17.84 --> 00:03:21.860
strike immediately there wouldn't be

80
00:03:20.03 --> 00:03:25.030
time for debate in the House of

81
00:03:21.86 --> 00:03:25.030
Representatives sort of Center

82
00:03:29.55 --> 00:03:33.780
hold on a minute here because there is

83
00:03:31.47 --> 00:03:35.790
much more imagine Donald Trump wakes up

84
00:03:33.78 --> 00:03:37.680
one morning and since he is my big fan

85
00:03:35.79 --> 00:03:40.950
of the Chinese people he decides to

86
00:03:37.68 --> 00:03:43.050
launch a nuke at Beijing from a legal

87
00:03:40.95 --> 00:03:44.580
and constitutional point of view he is

88
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:46.800
allowed to do so

89
00:03:44.58 --> 00:03:48.360
but this isn't going to be for free in

90
00:03:46.8 --> 00:03:49.950
this example launching a bomb against

91
00:03:48.36 --> 00:03:52.140
China would violate several

92
00:03:49.95 --> 00:03:53.970
international treaties as well as

93
00:03:52.14 --> 00:03:56.340
agreements between the United States and

94
00:03:53.97 --> 00:03:58.560
China this means the US Congress would

95
00:03:56.34 --> 00:04:00.060
ask him for an explanation or even call

96
00:03:58.56 --> 00:04:02.220
for a vote to decide whether he should

97
00:04:00.06 --> 00:04:05.130
be kicked out of the Oval Office or not

98
00:04:02.22 --> 00:04:06.720
this is a process called impeachment and

99
00:04:05.13 --> 00:04:08.670
it comes into effect when the

100
00:04:06.72 --> 00:04:10.320
president's breaks our law including

101
00:04:08.67 --> 00:04:12.900
treaties that the US has agreed to

102
00:04:10.32 --> 00:04:16.970
former presidents like Richard Nixon are

103
00:04:12.9 --> 00:04:16.970
rather familiar with this process

104
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:26.230
[Music]

105
00:04:24.0 --> 00:04:28.180
this is not the end of things though

106
00:04:26.23 --> 00:04:32.080
because there is far more than nukes in

107
00:04:28.18 --> 00:04:33.160
America's arsenal or and a state of

108
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:35.770
emergency

109
00:04:33.16 --> 00:04:38.440
so can Donald Trump declare war on

110
00:04:35.77 --> 00:04:41.410
another country all by himself however

111
00:04:38.44 --> 00:04:43.210
in cases of emergency the president can

112
00:04:41.41 --> 00:04:46.210
actually send troops into another

113
00:04:43.21 --> 00:04:49.190
country without a declaration of war by

114
00:04:46.21 --> 00:04:51.720
Congress ahead of time here's an example

115
00:04:49.19 --> 00:04:55.150
[Music]

116
00:04:51.72 --> 00:04:57.490
President Obama is facing criticism that

117
00:04:55.15 --> 00:04:59.070
versus the political divide for not

118
00:04:57.49 --> 00:05:01.930
seeking congressional authorization

119
00:04:59.07 --> 00:05:04.570
before or during the American military

120
00:05:01.93 --> 00:05:07.180
to join in attacks of Libyan earth

121
00:05:04.57 --> 00:05:08.500
defences and government forces this

122
00:05:07.18 --> 00:05:10.000
means that if Trump wanted to send

123
00:05:08.5 --> 00:05:11.380
troops to a country like Iran for

124
00:05:10.0 --> 00:05:13.419
example you can absolutely do it that

125
00:05:11.38 --> 00:05:15.400
you can only do it 60 days after that

126
00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.070
60-day period it has to report to

127
00:05:15.4 --> 00:05:19.630
Congress and get a vote declaring war

128
00:05:18.07 --> 00:05:21.460
this would mean an extended military

129
00:05:19.63 --> 00:05:23.289
presence in the territory so this means

130
00:05:21.46 --> 00:05:25.510
that you can send troops to a country it

131
00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.919
is an emergency that you can't send them

132
00:05:25.51 --> 00:05:29.320
there if you want them to stay for

133
00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.389
longer in that case you do need Congress

134
00:05:29.32 --> 00:05:34.539
to approve it nonetheless once Congress

135
00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.060
has declared a declaration of war the

136
00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.700
president has the power to micromanage

137
00:05:37.06 --> 00:05:42.550
the war however they want nonetheless

138
00:05:39.7 --> 00:05:42.970
once Congress has passed a declaration

139
00:05:42.55 --> 00:05:45.760
of war

140
00:05:42.97 --> 00:05:48.849
the President as commander-in-chief has

141
00:05:45.76 --> 00:05:49.580
the power to micromanage the war however

142
00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.590
they want

143
00:05:49.58 --> 00:05:53.220
[Applause]

144
00:05:50.59 --> 00:05:55.740
[Music]

145
00:05:53.22 --> 00:05:57.870
nonetheless once Congress has passed a

146
00:05:55.74 --> 00:06:00.150
declaration of war the president is

147
00:05:57.87 --> 00:06:01.620
allowed to micromanage the warfare as

148
00:06:00.15 --> 00:06:03.510
much as you want this means the

149
00:06:01.62 --> 00:06:05.640
president can give very specific and

150
00:06:03.51 --> 00:06:07.260
details orders if you remember the

151
00:06:05.64 --> 00:06:10.290
capture of Osama bin Laden that would

152
00:06:07.26 --> 00:06:12.000
sign rectify President Obama himself and

153
00:06:10.29 --> 00:06:14.160
then there are also the many drone

154
00:06:12.0 --> 00:06:15.870
strikes the President Obama also ordered

155
00:06:14.16 --> 00:06:17.250
itself but let's now move on from

156
00:06:15.87 --> 00:06:22.140
warfare and let's talk a little bit

157
00:06:17.25 --> 00:06:24.270
about economics barren world through the

158
00:06:22.14 --> 00:06:26.640
free trade agreement when it comes to

159
00:06:24.27 --> 00:06:29.130
the economy almost all domestic policies

160
00:06:26.64 --> 00:06:30.720
do have to go through Congress if Donald

161
00:06:29.13 --> 00:06:32.940
Trump wants to raise taxes it would

162
00:06:30.72 --> 00:06:34.860
require a legislative vote the same

163
00:06:32.94 --> 00:06:37.200
happens if he wants to liberalize one

164
00:06:34.86 --> 00:06:39.570
industry or nationalize another in many

165
00:06:37.2 --> 00:06:41.880
cases he might face the Supreme Court or

166
00:06:39.57 --> 00:06:43.950
even individual states who have their

167
00:06:41.88 --> 00:06:45.300
own power to stop some actions and

168
00:06:43.95 --> 00:06:46.500
that's something we're actually going to

169
00:06:45.3 --> 00:06:48.750
be covering in an upcoming video

170
00:06:46.5 --> 00:06:50.700
nonetheless there is an area where

171
00:06:48.75 --> 00:06:53.340
Donald Trump will have power to act

172
00:06:50.7 --> 00:06:55.410
however you want international trade

173
00:06:53.34 --> 00:06:58.050
agreements and this is really no small

174
00:06:55.41 --> 00:06:59.970
matter US companies buy and sell goods

175
00:06:58.05 --> 00:07:02.070
and services all over the world and

176
00:06:59.97 --> 00:07:03.870
these commercial relationships are

177
00:07:02.07 --> 00:07:06.380
regulated through international

178
00:07:03.87 --> 00:07:06.380
agreements

179
00:07:08.51 --> 00:07:13.100
many governments have the special taxes

180
00:07:10.73 --> 00:07:15.170
which calls tariffs on foreign goods in

181
00:07:13.1 --> 00:07:17.390
order to avoid these countries can sign

182
00:07:15.17 --> 00:07:20.360
what they call a free trade agreement

183
00:07:17.39 --> 00:07:22.670
here in North America we have the NAFTA

184
00:07:20.36 --> 00:07:25.130
treaty or the north american free trade

185
00:07:22.67 --> 00:07:26.540
association which allows for forms of

186
00:07:25.13 --> 00:07:29.930
free trade between the United States

187
00:07:26.54 --> 00:07:31.940
Canada and Mexico now this law is 20

188
00:07:29.93 --> 00:07:34.130
years old and because it's already on

189
00:07:31.94 --> 00:07:36.380
the books Donald Trump cannot

190
00:07:34.13 --> 00:07:39.620
unilaterally break it or change it in

191
00:07:36.38 --> 00:07:44.290
any major way you would need Congress to

192
00:07:39.62 --> 00:07:44.290
pass a new law in order to make changes

193
00:07:44.4 --> 00:07:48.640
[Music]

194
00:07:46.42 --> 00:07:50.680
nevertheless there are two other big

195
00:07:48.64 --> 00:07:52.540
treaties that were negotiated by Barack

196
00:07:50.68 --> 00:07:55.180
Obama that are still to be passed

197
00:07:52.54 --> 00:07:57.100
through Congress the first is the TPP

198
00:07:55.18 --> 00:07:59.560
that allows a form of free trade between

199
00:07:57.1 --> 00:08:02.320
America and Asia and Oceania the other

200
00:07:59.56 --> 00:08:04.240
is the TTIP which opens commerce with

201
00:08:02.32 --> 00:08:06.070
the European Union these two treaties

202
00:08:04.24 --> 00:08:08.170
were almost done they just needed to be

203
00:08:06.07 --> 00:08:10.300
passed by the American Congress as well

204
00:08:08.17 --> 00:08:11.920
as the legislative bodies of some other

205
00:08:10.3 --> 00:08:13.870
countries however the American

206
00:08:11.92 --> 00:08:16.390
Constitution says that any president can

207
00:08:13.87 --> 00:08:18.820
renegotiate or cancel any international

208
00:08:16.39 --> 00:08:20.980
treaties before they have been voted on

209
00:08:18.82 --> 00:08:23.110
by Congress and even if they were

210
00:08:20.98 --> 00:08:25.690
approved by the legislature he could

211
00:08:23.11 --> 00:08:28.360
still choose not to sign it if he didn't

212
00:08:25.69 --> 00:08:30.100
sign it this would be called a veto and

213
00:08:28.36 --> 00:08:32.640
as you probably well know Trump is no

214
00:08:30.1 --> 00:08:36.700
big fan of free trade and the TPP fails

215
00:08:32.64 --> 00:08:38.980
TPP is a horrible deal it is a deal that

216
00:08:36.7 --> 00:08:41.410
is going to lead to nothing but trouble

217
00:08:38.98 --> 00:08:43.840
it's a deal that was designed for China

218
00:08:41.41 --> 00:08:46.450
to come in as they always do through the

219
00:08:43.84 --> 00:08:48.670
backdoor and totally take advantage of

220
00:08:46.45 --> 00:08:52.090
everyone in fact the president can veto

221
00:08:48.67 --> 00:08:55.270
any law passed by Congress however he

222
00:08:52.09 --> 00:08:57.940
can only veto the whole law or treaty

223
00:08:55.27 --> 00:09:00.040
and send it back to Congress he cannot

224
00:08:57.94 --> 00:09:02.860
pick and choose what parts of the law

225
00:09:00.04 --> 00:09:05.350
that past's wanted sent back to Congress

226
00:09:02.86 --> 00:09:07.810
if Congress wants to pass it over the

227
00:09:05.35 --> 00:09:10.300
veto they would have to vote for it with

228
00:09:07.81 --> 00:09:12.130
a two-thirds majority but of course the

229
00:09:10.3 --> 00:09:14.810
main area where Donald Trump would like

230
00:09:12.13 --> 00:09:18.500
to use this super powers as president is

231
00:09:14.81 --> 00:09:21.959
[Music]

232
00:09:18.5 --> 00:09:24.089
great this was the most hated yet most

233
00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:26.220
repeated word in Donald Trump features

234
00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:28.379
during his entire election campaign

235
00:09:26.22 --> 00:09:29.940
nonetheless he almost has no executive

236
00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:32.399
powers with which and can act on this

237
00:09:29.94 --> 00:09:34.740
matter in order to build the wall Trump

238
00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:37.470
actually needs congressional approval

239
00:09:34.74 --> 00:09:39.899
because at the end of the day it's a

240
00:09:37.47 --> 00:09:42.389
major civil construction project so it

241
00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:45.420
needs a budget which Congress passes and

242
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:47.939
it also needs big land allocations which

243
00:09:45.42 --> 00:09:50.399
he needs Congress to acquire as well if

244
00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:52.620
he's going to build the wall without the

245
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:55.350
permission of any other American

246
00:09:52.62 --> 00:09:58.199
institution he actually has to get not

247
00:09:55.35 --> 00:10:00.389
only Mexico to pay for the wall but also

248
00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:02.759
to build the wall with in their own

249
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:04.110
borders but this is again something that

250
00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:07.739
we gotta keep talking about later

251
00:10:04.11 --> 00:10:07.739
[Music]

252
00:10:08.05 --> 00:10:12.189
the truth is now the American system

253
00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:13.779
only lets Trump do one thing

254
00:10:12.189 --> 00:10:16.449
order the Department of Homeland

255
00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:18.339
Security to prioritize the deportation

256
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.629
of illegal immigrants but you know

257
00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:21.939
what's particularly interesting about

258
00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:27.420
this and what the problem is matt said

259
00:10:21.939 --> 00:10:30.279
obama well he already did that Aviano

260
00:10:27.42 --> 00:10:32.679
administration obama la portada hamas

261
00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:34.989
can take any munna administration and

262
00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:36.489
deal so strange as it sounds when it

263
00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:38.649
comes to illegal immigration

264
00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:43.899
Trump's administration is expected to

265
00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:45.429
follow the steps of Obama so this is our

266
00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.929
opinion here a visual politic and now

267
00:10:45.429 --> 00:10:48.309
we'd love to know what you think do you

268
00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:50.649
think that the president should be able

269
00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:51.790
to make so many unilateral decisions

270
00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:53.619
without having to go through Congress

271
00:10:51.79 --> 00:10:55.089
you think it's kind of scary that one

272
00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:57.189
person has the authority did nuke

273
00:10:55.089 --> 00:10:58.869
