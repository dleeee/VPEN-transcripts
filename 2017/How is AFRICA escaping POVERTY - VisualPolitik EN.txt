1
00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.919
Kirra visual politic we have talked

2
00:00:16.39 --> 00:00:19.599
about how we now live in a world where

3
00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.730
every day there is less poverty and

4
00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.649
people are able to live better lives a

5
00:00:21.73 --> 00:00:25.020
change that is even reaching the most

6
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:28.439
unprotected region in the world

7
00:00:25.02 --> 00:00:28.439
sub-saharan Africa

8
00:00:28.78 --> 00:00:32.140
we already talked about the African

9
00:00:30.52 --> 00:00:34.630
lions and paid special attention to

10
00:00:32.14 --> 00:00:36.910
cases like Rwanda however we still need

11
00:00:34.63 --> 00:00:38.559
to talk about when and why this region

12
00:00:36.91 --> 00:00:42.690
of the world which so many considered

13
00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.690
hopelessly destitute began to change

14
00:00:44.82 --> 00:00:49.260
well that is precisely what we are going

15
00:00:46.83 --> 00:00:53.060
to talk about in this video that and

16
00:00:49.26 --> 00:00:53.060
what we can expect in the upcoming years

17
00:00:58.84 --> 00:01:03.769
for years talking about Africa has meant

18
00:01:01.43 --> 00:01:06.170
talking about extreme poverty natural

19
00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.299
disasters and all kinds of conflicts and

20
00:01:06.17 --> 00:01:11.360
in a way things are still that way see

21
00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.770
no more or less than half yes half of

22
00:01:11.36 --> 00:01:15.020
all the people who suffer from extreme

23
00:01:12.77 --> 00:01:17.420
poverty in the world live in the

24
00:01:15.02 --> 00:01:19.700
sub-saharan African region we're talking

25
00:01:17.42 --> 00:01:21.590
about four hundred million people here

26
00:01:19.7 --> 00:01:25.820
also news like this isn't surprising

27
00:01:21.59 --> 00:01:27.830
either we are facing the largest

28
00:01:25.82 --> 00:01:31.070
humanitarian crisis since the creation

29
00:01:27.83 --> 00:01:33.050
of the United Nations in 1945 now more

30
00:01:31.07 --> 00:01:35.229
than 20 million people across four

31
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:37.429
countries face starvation and famine

32
00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.929
Stephen O'Brien the un

33
00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.659
under-secretary-general for Humanitarian

34
00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.280
Affairs due to all of this I'm sure

35
00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.350
nobody is a stranger to those NGO

36
00:01:43.28 --> 00:01:47.270
campaigns seeking to raise funds for all

37
00:01:45.35 --> 00:01:48.619
kinds of humanitarian catastrophes in

38
00:01:47.27 --> 00:01:50.090
Africa you're probably also familiar

39
00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.679
with government's allocating billions of

40
00:01:50.09 --> 00:01:53.119
dollars each year to official

41
00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.799
development assistance in fact

42
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.100
government aid is as high as it's ever

43
00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.539
been

44
00:01:55.1 --> 00:01:58.970
every year the African continent

45
00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.679
receives about fifty billion dollars and

46
00:01:58.97 --> 00:02:02.679
this it's been going on for decades

47
00:02:05.69 --> 00:02:09.300
however the truth is that for years all

48
00:02:07.98 --> 00:02:11.220
of this money it didn't help very much

49
00:02:09.3 --> 00:02:14.060
let's take a look at for example the

50
00:02:11.22 --> 00:02:14.060
1990s

51
00:02:21.89 --> 00:02:26.150
while international aid in this area of

52
00:02:24.02 --> 00:02:27.980
the world amounted to tens of millions

53
00:02:26.15 --> 00:02:30.560
what do you think happens with poverty

54
00:02:27.98 --> 00:02:33.010
do you think it decreased well no none

55
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:33.010
of that actually

56
00:02:34.24 --> 00:02:41.760
between 1990 and 1998 poverty levels

57
00:02:37.06 --> 00:02:41.760
went from 55% to 58%

58
00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.659
well how could this be you might ask

59
00:02:44.2 --> 00:02:49.209
well because intentions are one thing

60
00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.430
that reality is really different some

61
00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.530
experts claim that for years official

62
00:02:51.43 --> 00:02:58.689
aid weakens local producers evidence

63
00:02:56.53 --> 00:03:00.639
overwhelmingly demonstrates that aid to

64
00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.810
Africa has made the poor poorer and

65
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.239
growth slower

66
00:03:01.81 --> 00:03:06.939
dambisa Moyo an economist and the author

67
00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.040
of dead aid why Aid is not working and

68
00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.719
how there is a better way for Africa for

69
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:12.969
example in Tanzania is cheap advice

70
00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.250
subsidized milk from the European Union

71
00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.319
than from local producers however with

72
00:03:15.25 --> 00:03:20.639
the beginning of a new century suddenly

73
00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.639
everything began to change

74
00:03:26.55 --> 00:03:30.360
but great change

75
00:03:30.93 --> 00:03:35.129
suddenly when Africa seemed helpless

76
00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.200
everything began to change with the

77
00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.269
beginning of the 21st century statistics

78
00:03:37.2 --> 00:03:41.280
absolutely turned around since the year

79
00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.900
2000 extreme poverty has dropped by

80
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:44.730
almost 40 percent average life

81
00:03:42.9 --> 00:03:46.650
expectancy has grown by more than 10

82
00:03:44.73 --> 00:03:48.450
years infant mortality has decreased to

83
00:03:46.65 --> 00:03:50.909
less than half the same has happened

84
00:03:48.45 --> 00:03:57.599
with HIV infections in children and well

85
00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:59.400
virtually any other statistics if we

86
00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.700
look at the economy we'll be able to see

87
00:03:59.4 --> 00:04:05.040
how between 2000 and 2015 sub-saharan

88
00:04:02.7 --> 00:04:06.389
African countries excluding South Africa

89
00:04:05.04 --> 00:04:08.159
which is a bit of a peculiar case as

90
00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.680
we've seen on visual politic previously

91
00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.750
grew by an average of 6 percent which is

92
00:04:10.68 --> 00:04:14.609
more than twice for example Latin

93
00:04:12.75 --> 00:04:20.759
America another great indicator of how

94
00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:22.440
things are changing is tourism yep

95
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.610
tourism you heard that right the tourism

96
00:04:22.44 --> 00:04:25.949
sector has some particular

97
00:04:23.61 --> 00:04:27.930
characteristics that reveal a lot of

98
00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.060
information on the one hand this sector

99
00:04:27.93 --> 00:04:31.740
has great transformation or power for

100
00:04:30.06 --> 00:04:33.810
the poorest because it's very labor

101
00:04:31.74 --> 00:04:35.159
intensive and on the other hand we need

102
00:04:33.81 --> 00:04:37.560
to take into account so that people

103
00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.289
donation in countries that are at war or

104
00:04:37.56 --> 00:04:42.240
a famine or have epidemics it's just not

105
00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.340
a nice holiday when this industry

106
00:04:42.24 --> 00:04:46.680
improves in the poorest countries it is

107
00:04:44.34 --> 00:04:50.460
usually a good indicator that things are

108
00:04:46.68 --> 00:04:52.020
improving as a whole well if we see the

109
00:04:50.46 --> 00:04:53.639
data we might be quite surprised because

110
00:04:52.02 --> 00:04:56.099
this sector has been growing at an

111
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.580
average annual rate of no less than 9%

112
00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.500
for 20 years that is two full decades of

113
00:04:59.58 --> 00:05:03.780
nearly double-digit growth yes it does

114
00:05:01.5 --> 00:05:06.020
seem as if things are really moving

115
00:05:03.78 --> 00:05:06.020
forward

116
00:05:09.25 --> 00:05:13.910
but at this point in the video you might

117
00:05:12.2 --> 00:05:17.090
be wondering something because I

118
00:05:13.91 --> 00:05:19.520
certainly am what on earth happens to

119
00:05:17.09 --> 00:05:20.840
cause such a change well have a look at

120
00:05:19.52 --> 00:05:26.750
this graph because it really gives a

121
00:05:20.84 --> 00:05:30.550
clue but what exactly led to this

122
00:05:26.75 --> 00:05:30.550
miracle well let's have a look at that

123
00:05:33.91 --> 00:05:40.820
preparing for takeoff many things drive

124
00:05:38.96 --> 00:05:42.680
change but we will now see how three

125
00:05:40.82 --> 00:05:44.630
particular events in Africa began to

126
00:05:42.68 --> 00:05:46.790
change probably permanently this

127
00:05:44.63 --> 00:05:49.340
continents reality the first one it was

128
00:05:46.79 --> 00:05:51.500
remittances see in Africa the population

129
00:05:49.34 --> 00:05:53.330
grows very quickly which along with the

130
00:05:51.5 --> 00:05:55.370
terrible living conditions has led many

131
00:05:53.33 --> 00:05:58.100
Africans to immigrate to richer

132
00:05:55.37 --> 00:06:00.080
countries in the past few decades today

133
00:05:58.1 --> 00:06:02.060
these people send tens of billions of

134
00:06:00.08 --> 00:06:03.890
dollars home every year this money is

135
00:06:02.06 --> 00:06:05.480
used in local markets or to set up

136
00:06:03.89 --> 00:06:07.730
businesses these are what we call

137
00:06:05.48 --> 00:06:10.330
remittances and they are actually much

138
00:06:07.73 --> 00:06:12.740
more important than developmental aid

139
00:06:10.33 --> 00:06:14.990
second and very importantly in March of

140
00:06:12.74 --> 00:06:16.700
2000 the US Congress finally approved a

141
00:06:14.99 --> 00:06:18.800
law that had been promoted by Bill

142
00:06:16.7 --> 00:06:20.240
Clinton in his last years in office it's

143
00:06:18.8 --> 00:06:22.520
called the African growth and

144
00:06:20.24 --> 00:06:24.350
opportunity Act this is basically a law

145
00:06:22.52 --> 00:06:26.210
that establishes a preferential trade

146
00:06:24.35 --> 00:06:28.640
agreements that eliminates tariffs and

147
00:06:26.21 --> 00:06:30.260
reduces barriers to trade for thousands

148
00:06:28.64 --> 00:06:34.820
and thousands of products from

149
00:06:30.26 --> 00:06:36.320
sub-saharan Africa see since this

150
00:06:34.82 --> 00:06:38.780
agreement was approved we can see that

151
00:06:36.32 --> 00:06:40.400
between 2000 and 2016 which weren't

152
00:06:38.78 --> 00:06:42.650
exactly the most prosperous years ever

153
00:06:40.4 --> 00:06:44.720
trade between the United States and

154
00:06:42.65 --> 00:06:46.640
sub-saharan Africa multiplied two and a

155
00:06:44.72 --> 00:06:49.419
half times which means a six percent

156
00:06:46.64 --> 00:06:49.419
growth every year

157
00:06:50.59 --> 00:06:55.160
and thirds and perhaps the key to

158
00:06:52.88 --> 00:06:57.710
everything there's China yep you had it

159
00:06:55.16 --> 00:06:59.720
right in 2001 China it joins the World

160
00:06:57.71 --> 00:07:02.090
Trade Organization and became something

161
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:03.350
of a factory to the world well what has

162
00:07:02.09 --> 00:07:05.330
happened since then has been quite

163
00:07:03.35 --> 00:07:07.460
impressive China's huge growth has

164
00:07:05.33 --> 00:07:09.830
lifted tens of millions of people out of

165
00:07:07.46 --> 00:07:16.700
poverty both in China and in Africa

166
00:07:09.83 --> 00:07:19.670
government of China enhancing Ethiopia's

167
00:07:16.7 --> 00:07:22.840
industrialization and on supporting the

168
00:07:19.67 --> 00:07:30.140
obvious great vision to become Africa's

169
00:07:22.84 --> 00:07:32.270
manufacturing allow me to explain myself

170
00:07:30.14 --> 00:07:34.070
here the Asian Giants gigantic growth

171
00:07:32.27 --> 00:07:36.440
has increased this country's demand for

172
00:07:34.07 --> 00:07:39.980
all kinds of products raw materials food

173
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:41.570
manufacturing everything what many

174
00:07:39.98 --> 00:07:43.760
African countries took advantage of this

175
00:07:41.57 --> 00:07:45.890
opportunity since the year 2000 trade

176
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:48.830
between China and Africa has multiplied

177
00:07:45.89 --> 00:07:51.290
by no less than 17 times representing an

178
00:07:48.83 --> 00:07:54.080
annual growth rate of almost 20% since

179
00:07:51.29 --> 00:07:57.720
2009 China is already by far the

180
00:07:54.08 --> 00:08:00.210
continents largest trading partner

181
00:07:57.72 --> 00:08:02.400
but not only that the Chinese as we

182
00:08:00.21 --> 00:08:04.410
mentioned here have also been investing

183
00:08:02.4 --> 00:08:11.070
a lot of money all over the world and

184
00:08:04.41 --> 00:08:12.840
Africa is certainly no exception in 2016

185
00:08:11.07 --> 00:08:14.700
four out of every ten euros that

186
00:08:12.84 --> 00:08:16.500
foreigners invested in Africa came from

187
00:08:14.7 --> 00:08:18.000
China today more than ten thousand

188
00:08:16.5 --> 00:08:19.620
Chinese companies are doing business on

189
00:08:18.0 --> 00:08:21.540
the African continent mostly private

190
00:08:19.62 --> 00:08:23.370
companies that work in all kinds of

191
00:08:21.54 --> 00:08:29.580
industries and that number well it just

192
00:08:23.37 --> 00:08:31.530
keeps rising yes my friends this is how

193
00:08:29.58 --> 00:08:33.539
Africa has managed to start turning the

194
00:08:31.53 --> 00:08:35.070
statistics around the great catalyst for

195
00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.200
this entire change it wasn't some kind

196
00:08:35.07 --> 00:08:39.390
of miracle and it didn't have much to do

197
00:08:37.2 --> 00:08:41.909
with developmental aid this change was

198
00:08:39.39 --> 00:08:43.800
driven by trade and investments and

199
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.780
Africans themselves seem to see it very

200
00:08:43.8 --> 00:08:48.300
clearly if you don't believe me I'll

201
00:08:45.78 --> 00:08:49.950
take a look at this African countries

202
00:08:48.3 --> 00:08:52.500
are forging ahead to complete

203
00:08:49.95 --> 00:08:55.950
negotiations for a continental free

204
00:08:52.5 --> 00:08:58.050
trade area between 55 countries by early

205
00:08:55.95 --> 00:09:00.510
next year the idea adopted by the

206
00:08:58.05 --> 00:09:02.370
African Union in 2012 is to create a

207
00:09:00.51 --> 00:09:04.560
single market which includes the free

208
00:09:02.37 --> 00:09:07.050
movement of goods services and people

209
00:09:04.56 --> 00:09:09.240
yes that's right Africa is working to

210
00:09:07.05 --> 00:09:10.680
expand trade to every corner of the

211
00:09:09.24 --> 00:09:12.480
continent not all countries are

212
00:09:10.68 --> 00:09:16.070
developing equally but this is quite

213
00:09:12.48 --> 00:09:16.070
normal in all parts of the world

214
00:09:18.31 --> 00:09:23.730
following the Asian star

215
00:09:21.57 --> 00:09:26.339
at this point we need to ask ourselves

216
00:09:23.73 --> 00:09:28.889
another question can we really dream of

217
00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:29.940
Africa's final take off see I suspect

218
00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:31.529
that many of you are probably thinking

219
00:09:29.94 --> 00:09:33.839
right now well everything you say in

220
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:36.329
visual politic is very nice but it isn't

221
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.740
usually what really happens well yes in

222
00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:39.149
Africa it's absolutely true there are

223
00:09:37.74 --> 00:09:40.560
countries that are doing well and there

224
00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:42.540
are countries that are not doing well

225
00:09:40.56 --> 00:09:44.550
but you know what that's true but it's

226
00:09:42.54 --> 00:09:47.490
also really normal see it may sound

227
00:09:44.55 --> 00:09:49.440
shocking today but in the 1950s Asia was

228
00:09:47.49 --> 00:09:50.940
as poor as Africa I mean today we can

229
00:09:49.44 --> 00:09:52.829
look at cities like Shanghai Hong Kong

230
00:09:50.94 --> 00:09:54.690
Taipei it makes it really hard to

231
00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:56.970
imagine that these places were once poor

232
00:09:54.69 --> 00:09:57.420
but when South Korea or Taiwan began to

233
00:09:56.97 --> 00:09:58.829
grow

234
00:09:57.42 --> 00:10:01.470
they weren't richer than Ghana or

235
00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:05.420
Senegal for example and China India and

236
00:10:01.47 --> 00:10:05.420
Vietnam they were of course way poorer

237
00:10:10.54 --> 00:10:13.810
well we can absolutely draw some really

238
00:10:12.49 --> 00:10:15.940
interesting ideas from this because

239
00:10:13.81 --> 00:10:18.130
Asian countries didn't grow all at once

240
00:10:15.94 --> 00:10:20.380
and they didn't grow all together while

241
00:10:18.13 --> 00:10:22.120
Korea Singapore Japan and Taiwan grew

242
00:10:20.38 --> 00:10:25.440
other countries such as China Indonesia

243
00:10:22.12 --> 00:10:28.210
and India remains immersed in poverty

244
00:10:25.44 --> 00:10:30.280
also they weren't exactly Democratic

245
00:10:28.21 --> 00:10:32.200
models South Korea and Taiwan were under

246
00:10:30.28 --> 00:10:34.360
hard dictatorships until very recently

247
00:10:32.2 --> 00:10:39.760
Singapore is in a similar state and

248
00:10:34.36 --> 00:10:41.620
China well what can I say in short lots

249
00:10:39.76 --> 00:10:43.270
of poverty some more advanced countries

250
00:10:41.62 --> 00:10:45.010
with others further behind plenty of

251
00:10:43.27 --> 00:10:46.660
dictatorships essentially what we're

252
00:10:45.01 --> 00:10:47.980
seeing in Africa today wasn't so

253
00:10:46.66 --> 00:10:51.030
different from what was happening in

254
00:10:47.98 --> 00:10:51.030
Asia just fifty years ago

255
00:10:54.58 --> 00:10:57.810
ready for takeoff

256
00:10:58.5 --> 00:11:02.730
yes things in Africa are changing out of

257
00:11:01.32 --> 00:11:05.970
the ten countries that are apparently

258
00:11:02.73 --> 00:11:08.510
growing the most in 2017 five are in

259
00:11:05.97 --> 00:11:08.510
Africa

260
00:11:10.3 --> 00:11:14.320
if we take a look at the latest doing

261
00:11:12.31 --> 00:11:15.790
business report the World Bank indicator

262
00:11:14.32 --> 00:11:17.680
for measuring how easy it is to do

263
00:11:15.79 --> 00:11:19.420
business in certain economies we can see

264
00:11:17.68 --> 00:11:22.830
that out of the ten countries that have

265
00:11:19.42 --> 00:11:25.690
improved the most four are also Africa

266
00:11:22.83 --> 00:11:27.400
true poverty here is still very high in

267
00:11:25.69 --> 00:11:28.960
these countries are facing a difficult

268
00:11:27.4 --> 00:11:30.820
challenge indeed the large population

269
00:11:28.96 --> 00:11:32.170
growth on the continent is actually

270
00:11:30.82 --> 00:11:34.000
going to multiply in the upcoming

271
00:11:32.17 --> 00:11:35.890
decades however dear viewer the good

272
00:11:34.0 --> 00:11:37.540
news is that everything indicates but

273
00:11:35.89 --> 00:11:39.940
thanks to trade and the international

274
00:11:37.54 --> 00:11:42.340
investment Africa is finding its way and

275
00:11:39.94 --> 00:11:44.020
maybe once and for all is ready for take

276
00:11:42.34 --> 00:11:45.970
off but now it's your turn do you think

277
00:11:44.02 --> 00:11:48.400
that Africa will emulate the development

278
00:11:45.97 --> 00:11:49.900
that Asia has had in recent decades well

279
00:11:48.4 --> 00:11:52.300
