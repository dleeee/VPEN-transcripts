3
00:00:07.37 --> 00:00:11.700
have you ever heard of Erbil despite

4
00:00:10.11 --> 00:00:13.769
threats from Baghdad it seems probable

5
00:00:11.7 --> 00:00:15.269
that geography students will soon have

6
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.580
to learn the name of this capital city

7
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.920
as well as its new country and that

8
00:00:17.58 --> 00:00:21.539
would be Iraqi Kurdistan the 25th of

9
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:23.130
December this year was a historical

10
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.810
moments for the more than five million

11
00:00:23.13 --> 00:00:26.460
Kurds who currently live in this

12
00:00:24.81 --> 00:00:32.099
autonomous community in the north of

13
00:00:26.46 --> 00:00:33.870
Iraq and well why was this well that's

14
00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.149
because of after decades of unfulfilled

15
00:00:33.87 --> 00:00:37.649
promises and ethnic repression they have

16
00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.140
the opportunity to vote in a referendum

17
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.750
organized by the regional government of

18
00:00:40.14 --> 00:00:45.329
Kurdistan since 2005 and according to

19
00:00:42.75 --> 00:00:47.370
the constitution of Iran Kurdistan is an

20
00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.629
autonomous region despite it being an

21
00:00:47.37 --> 00:00:50.879
autonomous region though this place

22
00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.890
essentially works as its own almost

23
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.660
independent country and the result of

24
00:00:52.89 --> 00:00:57.260
this was that the population really

25
00:00:54.66 --> 00:00:59.920
wanted to be fully independent

26
00:00:57.26 --> 00:01:02.480
[Music]

27
00:00:59.92 --> 00:01:04.820
the day of the referendum Kurds showed

28
00:01:02.48 --> 00:01:06.500
up on mass to the polling stations even

29
00:01:04.82 --> 00:01:08.450
the speaker's of mosques encouraged

30
00:01:06.5 --> 00:01:10.729
voters to go to the polls while the

31
00:01:08.45 --> 00:01:12.800
final results showed the referendum was

32
00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.020
a complete success more than seven out

33
00:01:12.8 --> 00:01:17.930
of every ten Kurds went to vote

34
00:01:15.02 --> 00:01:19.610
that's almost 3.1 million voters the

35
00:01:17.93 --> 00:01:21.650
victory well it was overwhelming for

36
00:01:19.61 --> 00:01:23.360
those who supported independence the

37
00:01:21.65 --> 00:01:25.400
movement is obtained ninety two point

38
00:01:23.36 --> 00:01:27.350
seven three percent of the vote and you

39
00:01:25.4 --> 00:01:28.850
know what well this tribe that's totally

40
00:01:27.35 --> 00:01:30.409
understandable because we're talking

41
00:01:28.85 --> 00:01:33.020
about some of the most ill treated

42
00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.399
people in history they well treated

43
00:01:33.02 --> 00:01:35.930
despite the fact that the Kurds are

44
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.640
according to many experts the most

45
00:01:35.93 --> 00:01:42.220
ancient people in this entire region

46
00:01:38.64 --> 00:01:44.380
[Music]

47
00:01:42.22 --> 00:01:46.270
it is estimated that their culture their

48
00:01:44.38 --> 00:01:47.890
language their rituals essentially

49
00:01:46.27 --> 00:01:49.630
everything that could define them have

50
00:01:47.89 --> 00:01:52.300
been in this part of the world upper

51
00:01:49.63 --> 00:01:54.400
Mesopotamia for more than four thousand

52
00:01:52.3 --> 00:01:56.560
years in fact many of these experts

53
00:01:54.4 --> 00:01:58.810
consider the city center of Erbil the

54
00:01:56.56 --> 00:02:00.970
capital has the oldest human settlement

55
00:01:58.81 --> 00:02:01.980
to be continuously inhabited on the

56
00:02:00.97 --> 00:02:05.150
planet

57
00:02:01.98 --> 00:02:05.150
[Applause]

58
00:02:05.98 --> 00:02:11.120
in other words the Kurds are bolder than

59
00:02:08.99 --> 00:02:13.340
the Persians or indeed the Arabs however

60
00:02:11.12 --> 00:02:15.020
they have suffered from all kinds of

61
00:02:13.34 --> 00:02:17.150
persecution see the total number of

62
00:02:15.02 --> 00:02:20.180
Kurds is around 30 million spread across

63
00:02:17.15 --> 00:02:22.970
mainly four countries Turkey Iran Syria

64
00:02:20.18 --> 00:02:24.710
and Iraq well in all of these places the

65
00:02:22.97 --> 00:02:26.540
Kurds have suffered the consequences of

66
00:02:24.71 --> 00:02:28.640
nationalism which has tried to make them

67
00:02:26.54 --> 00:02:30.950
disappear as a community they've tried

68
00:02:28.64 --> 00:02:32.840
to end their culture their language as

69
00:02:30.95 --> 00:02:36.260
well as trying to close down their media

70
00:02:32.84 --> 00:02:38.270
outlets between 1986 and 1989 Saddam

71
00:02:36.26 --> 00:02:41.030
Hussein launched the am full of campaign

72
00:02:38.27 --> 00:02:44.930
and estimations are the between 50,000

73
00:02:41.03 --> 00:02:46.910
and 180,000 Kurds died as a result as he

74
00:02:44.93 --> 00:02:48.860
might imagine this cannot easily be

75
00:02:46.91 --> 00:02:50.330
forgotten my grandfather had a good

76
00:02:48.86 --> 00:02:52.040
sense of humor he used to say that he

77
00:02:50.33 --> 00:02:53.720
was born occured in a free country

78
00:02:52.04 --> 00:02:55.640
then the Ottomans arrived and said to my

79
00:02:53.72 --> 00:02:57.620
grandfather your ottoman at the fall of

80
00:02:55.64 --> 00:02:59.240
the Ottoman Empire he became Turkish the

81
00:02:57.62 --> 00:03:00.800
Turks left and he became a Girt again

82
00:02:59.24 --> 00:03:02.390
then the British arrived so my

83
00:03:00.8 --> 00:03:04.340
grandfather became a subject of his

84
00:03:02.39 --> 00:03:06.560
gracious majesty the British invented

85
00:03:04.34 --> 00:03:08.090
Iraq so my grandfather became Iraqi but

86
00:03:06.56 --> 00:03:10.459
to his dying breath he was never proud

87
00:03:08.09 --> 00:03:12.260
of being Iraqi he near Salim my father's

88
00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.420
rifle a childhood in Kurdistan

89
00:03:12.26 --> 00:03:16.400
considering the history it's no surprise

90
00:03:14.42 --> 00:03:18.410
that the Kurds once once and for all to

91
00:03:16.4 --> 00:03:20.450
make the dream of having their own state

92
00:03:18.41 --> 00:03:22.910
come true and if we add up the fact that

93
00:03:20.45 --> 00:03:24.920
Iraqi Kurdistan is quite a rich area in

94
00:03:22.91 --> 00:03:26.660
terms of oil and natural gas as well as

95
00:03:24.92 --> 00:03:28.970
fresh water by the way we can understand

96
00:03:26.66 --> 00:03:30.380
even more why they want independence so

97
00:03:28.97 --> 00:03:31.970
to some of the Kurds they wanted their

98
00:03:30.38 --> 00:03:34.800
own country and so they held a

99
00:03:31.97 --> 00:03:37.950
referendum in order to do that

100
00:03:34.8 --> 00:03:41.760
[Music]

101
00:03:37.95 --> 00:03:41.760
the referendum

102
00:03:42.41 --> 00:03:46.400
as we have said Kurdistan is almost an

103
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:48.080
independent country already they even

104
00:03:46.4 --> 00:03:50.420
have their own army of more than two

105
00:03:48.08 --> 00:03:52.160
hundred thousand soldiers this army is

106
00:03:50.42 --> 00:03:54.080
called the Peshmerga and they've by the

107
00:03:52.16 --> 00:03:55.760
way been the main defense to Islamic

108
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:57.770
state in Iraq do you bear this in mind

109
00:03:55.76 --> 00:03:59.900
because the government of Kurdistan is a

110
00:03:57.77 --> 00:04:01.490
close ally of Washington indeed it may

111
00:03:59.9 --> 00:04:03.740
be their most loyal ally in the region

112
00:04:01.49 --> 00:04:06.020
because of this the US has trained and

113
00:04:03.74 --> 00:04:07.310
financed and well-armed their army

114
00:04:06.02 --> 00:04:11.260
so I'm indeed even saved that the Kurds

115
00:04:07.31 --> 00:04:11.260
are as pro-american as the taxes

116
00:04:12.2 --> 00:04:17.850
[Music]

117
00:04:15.35 --> 00:04:19.829
so after many difficult years of intense

118
00:04:17.85 --> 00:04:21.299
fighting against Islamic state it has

119
00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.250
been clear for the Kurds there are

120
00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.960
almost no advantages in remaining in

121
00:04:23.25 --> 00:04:26.669
Iraq and the governments of a bill took

122
00:04:24.96 --> 00:04:28.410
advantage of these battles in order to

123
00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.479
integrate Kurd areas into their

124
00:04:28.41 --> 00:04:32.639
political space for example there is the

125
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.590
province of Kirkuk who has a majority of

126
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.960
Kurds but was not within the autonomous

127
00:04:34.59 --> 00:04:38.460
region of Kurdistan Kirkuk is something

128
00:04:36.96 --> 00:04:40.500
of a crown jewel and one of the main

129
00:04:38.46 --> 00:04:42.030
reasons for the conflicts with the Iraqi

130
00:04:40.5 --> 00:04:43.860
government who by the way is not

131
00:04:42.03 --> 00:04:45.810
hesitated to send their troops over to

132
00:04:43.86 --> 00:04:47.940
recover the settlements Iraqi forces

133
00:04:45.81 --> 00:04:49.950
sweep into Kirkuk checking Kurdish

134
00:04:47.94 --> 00:04:51.150
independence drive so why is this

135
00:04:49.95 --> 00:04:52.740
territory so valuable

136
00:04:51.15 --> 00:04:54.990
well that's because Kirkuk is the

137
00:04:52.74 --> 00:04:56.700
province that contains the most oil in

138
00:04:54.99 --> 00:04:58.860
Kurdistan in fact it's been estimated

139
00:04:56.7 --> 00:05:01.470
that around 10 percent of all Iraqi oil

140
00:04:58.86 --> 00:05:03.750
reserves are concentrated here in Kirkuk

141
00:05:01.47 --> 00:05:06.350
and nobody wants to let go

142
00:05:03.75 --> 00:05:08.810
[Music]

143
00:05:06.35 --> 00:05:11.150
in 2007 a referendum it should have been

144
00:05:08.81 --> 00:05:13.370
conducted in order to incorporate or not

145
00:05:11.15 --> 00:05:15.650
the autonomous region of Kurdistan but

146
00:05:13.37 --> 00:05:17.510
the voting they never took place so when

147
00:05:15.65 --> 00:05:19.340
the Peshmerga occupied the city in order

148
00:05:17.51 --> 00:05:21.560
to protect it from Islamic state since

149
00:05:19.34 --> 00:05:24.230
the Iraqi army had literally run away

150
00:05:21.56 --> 00:05:26.330
the Kurd government had facto annex the

151
00:05:24.23 --> 00:05:28.130
territory so with these conditions and

152
00:05:26.33 --> 00:05:30.860
with the constant negotiations between

153
00:05:28.13 --> 00:05:32.870
Baghdad and Erbil lands with a growing

154
00:05:30.86 --> 00:05:36.050
disconnect between both territories they

155
00:05:32.87 --> 00:05:37.490
eventually got the referendum this is

156
00:05:36.05 --> 00:05:39.530
the first time in history that the

157
00:05:37.49 --> 00:05:41.000
people of Kurdistan will freely decide

158
00:05:39.53 --> 00:05:42.860
their future after that we will start

159
00:05:41.0 --> 00:05:45.710
talks with Baghdad to reach an agreement

160
00:05:42.86 --> 00:05:47.930
over borders water and oil mr. Barzani

161
00:05:45.71 --> 00:05:49.670
president of Iraqi Kurdistan now the

162
00:05:47.93 --> 00:05:51.830
governments of Iraq opposed this

163
00:05:49.67 --> 00:05:53.480
referendum in every way and the

164
00:05:51.83 --> 00:05:55.430
Constitutional Court of Iraq even

165
00:05:53.48 --> 00:05:57.020
outlawed it Parliament asked for many

166
00:05:55.43 --> 00:05:58.880
things including the withdrawal of

167
00:05:57.02 --> 00:06:00.740
diplomatic representation in Erbil they

168
00:05:58.88 --> 00:06:02.840
bought a closed gym and even army

169
00:06:00.74 --> 00:06:04.550
deployments in Kirkuk there was also the

170
00:06:02.84 --> 00:06:06.350
prosecution of organizers of the

171
00:06:04.55 --> 00:06:08.300
referendum and of course Parliament

172
00:06:06.35 --> 00:06:10.040
tried their best to remain in control of

173
00:06:08.3 --> 00:06:11.750
all of the oil but even with this kind

174
00:06:10.04 --> 00:06:15.040
of action by the Iraqi government the

175
00:06:11.75 --> 00:06:15.040
Kurds they didn't really care

176
00:06:18.05 --> 00:06:22.370
and that's only logical because despite

177
00:06:20.15 --> 00:06:24.620
the progress of the Iraqi army the risk

178
00:06:22.37 --> 00:06:26.810
for Kurdistan is probably not in Iraq

179
00:06:24.62 --> 00:06:27.409
but rather with the international

180
00:06:26.81 --> 00:06:29.629
community

181
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.220
you see Turkey and Iran they don't even

182
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.110
want to hear about an independent

183
00:06:31.22 --> 00:06:34.759
Kurdistan that's because they might give

184
00:06:33.11 --> 00:06:35.979
the Kurds in their territories the idea

185
00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.270
that they can replicate this success

186
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.310
Turkey for instance has been a war with

187
00:06:38.27 --> 00:06:42.139
the Kurds for decades but that's a story

188
00:06:40.31 --> 00:06:44.750
for another day the thing is that these

189
00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.229
countries have allied with Iraq in order

190
00:06:44.75 --> 00:06:50.240
to defy the referendum Turkey's military

191
00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.370
has confirmed that Turkey and Iraq will

192
00:06:50.24 --> 00:06:54.080
conduct joint military drills in Turkey

193
00:06:52.37 --> 00:06:56.389
along an area bordering Iraq

194
00:06:54.08 --> 00:07:00.020
semi-autonomous Kurdish region Iran's

195
00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:02.120
semi official is na news agency reported

196
00:07:00.02 --> 00:07:04.490
on Sunday that the Supreme National

197
00:07:02.12 --> 00:07:07.280
Security Council closed Iranian airspace

198
00:07:04.49 --> 00:07:09.469
to the Iraqi Kurdish area at the request

199
00:07:07.28 --> 00:07:11.630
of the central government in Baghdad and

200
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:13.610
no it's not just about the possibility

201
00:07:11.63 --> 00:07:15.319
of conflicts after all this is likely to

202
00:07:13.61 --> 00:07:17.330
be the result of fear tactics which are

203
00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:19.009
very usual in this kind of situation and

204
00:07:17.33 --> 00:07:21.349
they rarely work by the way remember

205
00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.669
Kurdistan is a close ally of the USA and

206
00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:24.919
they have an experienced and

207
00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:27.259
well-trained army no the bigger issue

208
00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.120
here might be that Kurdistan they need

209
00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.979
their neighbors this territory its

210
00:07:29.12 --> 00:07:33.349
landlocked and they are very dependent

211
00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:35.330
on Turkey both in order to export their

212
00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:37.759
oil then to import anything that they

213
00:07:35.33 --> 00:07:40.360
might need so a trade blockade it would

214
00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:43.550
be a serious threat for this territory

215
00:07:40.36 --> 00:07:45.800
the kr G's economy depends on one

216
00:07:43.55 --> 00:07:47.599
pipeline that sells oil to international

217
00:07:45.8 --> 00:07:49.639
markets and that pipeline goes through

218
00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:51.710
Turkey you shut down that pipeline you

219
00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:53.900
choke the Kurdish economy Bilal Wahab

221
00:07:53.9 --> 00:07:58.099
Near East policy but there is more to it

222
00:07:56.27 --> 00:07:59.810
than just their neighbors nobody wants

223
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:01.669
anymore tension with this part of the

224
00:07:59.81 --> 00:08:03.560
world so internationally speaking that

225
00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:05.630
referendum didn't get much support the

226
00:08:03.56 --> 00:08:07.520
US has opposed it and Antonio Guterres

227
00:08:05.63 --> 00:08:09.229
Secretary General of the UN has

228
00:08:07.52 --> 00:08:11.449
described it as dangerous and

229
00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:12.740
potentially disruptive and today Israel

230
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.210
is the only country that supports

231
00:08:12.74 --> 00:08:15.680
independence so this might mean the

232
00:08:14.21 --> 00:08:17.479
future is not looking very good right

233
00:08:15.68 --> 00:08:19.340
well wait just a second because despite

234
00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:21.469
all of this it is very likely the

235
00:08:19.34 --> 00:08:23.410
Kurdistan will achieve independence you

236
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:30.759
know or later

the reasons for a new country Iraqi

Kurdistan it's got many issues however

240
00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:41.680
they have managed you become the region

241
00:08:39.339 --> 00:08:44.680
that functions the best in Iraq they are

242
00:08:41.68 --> 00:08:46.570
the safest and wealthiest area I've been

243
00:08:44.68 --> 00:08:48.760
to Iraqi Kurdistan a number of times

244
00:08:46.57 --> 00:08:51.010
it's safer than Kansas if you're coming

245
00:08:48.76 --> 00:08:53.589
from Baghdad or Mosul it's practically

journalist check this out

248
00:08:54.88 --> 00:08:58.600
in 2014 before the is offensive this

249
00:08:57.22 --> 00:09:00.880
region was turning into the most

250
00:08:58.6 --> 00:09:03.190
relevant financial and tourist spot in

251
00:09:00.88 --> 00:09:05.290
Iraq an oasis from any businessman both

252
00:09:03.19 --> 00:09:07.060
local and foreign skyscrapers smalls and

253
00:09:05.29 --> 00:09:09.040
mansions were spreading like mushrooms

254
00:09:07.06 --> 00:09:10.720
after the rain that was until war broke

255
00:09:09.04 --> 00:09:13.149
out in Iraq against the Islamic state

256
00:09:10.72 --> 00:09:15.190
then most of this development it simply

257
00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:18.130
had to stop now after an awful few years

258
00:09:15.19 --> 00:09:19.810
of war in 2017 the numbers are bouncing

259
00:09:18.13 --> 00:09:22.029
back and do you remember that this area

260
00:09:19.81 --> 00:09:24.040
is oil-rich some estimations calculate

261
00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:26.019
the oil reserves of Kurdistan at forty

262
00:09:24.04 --> 00:09:26.440
five billion barrels but this in two

263
00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:28.540
words

264
00:09:26.44 --> 00:09:31.149
Kurdistan would be among the 15 oil

265
00:09:28.54 --> 00:09:33.010
richest countries on earth and this is

266
00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:35.800
in a country with little more than five

267
00:09:33.01 --> 00:09:37.810
million inhabitants but there's still so

268
00:09:35.8 --> 00:09:39.670
much more Iraq's Kurdistan is quite

269
00:09:37.81 --> 00:09:41.620
business-friendly indeed they like

270
00:09:39.67 --> 00:09:43.630
private initiatives something uncommon

271
00:09:41.62 --> 00:09:45.370
in this part of the globe taxes are also

272
00:09:43.63 --> 00:09:47.260
attractive and bureaucracy is not

273
00:09:45.37 --> 00:09:49.870
excessive either unfortunately though

274
00:09:47.26 --> 00:09:51.639
there is still plenty of corruption the

275
00:09:49.87 --> 00:09:53.529
Kurdistan government will do its best to

276
00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:55.810
help the private sector and have them

277
00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:57.850
invest here I invite all local and

278
00:09:55.81 --> 00:09:59.800
foreign investors here to take advantage

279
00:09:57.85 --> 00:10:02.199
of our laws and offers and invest

Massoud Barzani president of Iraqi

281
00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:05.380
Kurdistan the thing is that this region

282
00:10:04.089 --> 00:10:07.779
has enough going for it to make

283
00:10:05.38 --> 00:10:09.970
Kurdistan a prosperous country their

284
00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:11.769
fertile lands high levels of safety and

285
00:10:09.97 --> 00:10:13.839
natural resources further their

286
00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:16.089
geographical location is beneficial

287
00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:18.490
it's a place between Turkey Iran and

288
00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:21.190
Iraq but on top of all of that this new

289
00:10:18.49 --> 00:10:23.230
country it's only well there the Kurd

290
00:10:21.19 --> 00:10:24.730
people and especially Araki Kurds have

291
00:10:23.23 --> 00:10:26.649
been supported for tax with chemical

292
00:10:24.73 --> 00:10:28.839
weapons and have suffered all sorts of

293
00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:30.579
social engineering in order to strangle

294
00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:32.649
their culture and now they have an

295
00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:33.910
opportunity to build their own country

296
00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.130
further the rest of us could also

297
00:10:33.91 --> 00:10:38.260
benefit from a more moderate prosperous

298
00:10:36.13 --> 00:10:39.970
and free country than the ones around it

299
00:10:38.26 --> 00:10:41.620
in the Middle East would certainly be

300
00:10:39.97 --> 00:10:43.220
better for it so now we've got to

301
00:10:41.62 --> 00:10:45.319
consider the problems in Iraq iike

302
00:10:43.22 --> 00:10:47.990
I mean first of all are there any well

303
00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:49.759
yes absolutely but that's no excuse to

304
00:10:47.99 --> 00:10:51.920
not make this new country happen first

305
00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:53.990
because these problems exist now within

306
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:55.879
still being a part of Iraq and second

307
00:10:53.99 --> 00:10:57.470
because they are less serious than the

308
00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:58.850
ones in the rest of the country so what

309
00:10:57.47 --> 00:11:01.550
about corruption yes it's totally

310
00:10:58.85 --> 00:11:03.470
Varun's is there oil dependency also yes

311
00:11:01.55 --> 00:11:06.139
and what about debt well yes there is

312
00:11:03.47 --> 00:11:07.610
that too but this is totally normal in

313
00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:10.430
this part of the world the rest of Iraq

314
00:11:07.61 --> 00:11:11.959
is in a much worse situation well anyway

315
00:11:10.43 --> 00:11:13.550
we just wish that Baghdad's a response

316
00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:15.379
does not turn the situation into a

317
00:11:13.55 --> 00:11:17.360
military conflict that would be a

318
00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:19.160
terrible scenario for everyone

319
00:11:17.36 --> 00:11:21.230
indeed it would be a situation where

320
00:11:19.16 --> 00:11:22.819
political interests prevail above the

321
00:11:21.23 --> 00:11:24.560
interests of the people but now it's

322
00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:26.750
time for your opinion do you support the

323
00:11:24.56 --> 00:11:28.279
idea of the independence of Kurdistan

324
00:11:26.75 --> 00:11:29.959
well do you leave your answer in the

325
