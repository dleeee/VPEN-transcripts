00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.990
Argentina is a country famous for three

4
00:00:09.51 --> 00:00:13.500
things

5
00:00:09.99 --> 00:00:15.870
tango soccer and the economic crises all

6
00:00:13.5 --> 00:00:17.160
those that last one might change sooner

7
00:00:15.87 --> 00:00:18.570
rather than later

8
00:00:17.16 --> 00:00:20.910
yes viviÃ³ anse again we are talking

9
00:00:18.57 --> 00:00:22.949
about lithium or white gold all the new

10
00:00:20.91 --> 00:00:25.170
oils and it's discussed such batteries

11
00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.779
are made out of lithium is what power is

12
00:00:25.17 --> 00:00:33.270
your smartphone your laptop and maybe

13
00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.280
even your electric car as we said in

14
00:00:33.27 --> 00:00:36.870
this other video Argentina is alongside

15
00:00:35.28 --> 00:00:38.489
with Chile and Bolivia

16
00:00:36.87 --> 00:00:41.010
one of these three countries that make

17
00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.960
up this so called lithium triangle this

18
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:44.280
is an area where sixty to eighty percent

19
00:00:42.96 --> 00:00:46.260
of the world's discovered lithium

20
00:00:44.28 --> 00:00:47.940
reserves are concentrators from these

21
00:00:46.26 --> 00:00:49.620
three countries Argentina is getting the

22
00:00:47.94 --> 00:00:54.960
biggest attention by international

23
00:00:49.62 --> 00:00:56.520
investors yes you heard that right of

24
00:00:54.96 --> 00:00:59.399
the biggest hedge funds have their eyes

25
00:00:56.52 --> 00:01:01.289
on this country and this is a big

26
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.780
surprise given the dodging Tina used to

27
00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.479
be the boogeyman of finances the problem

28
00:01:03.78 --> 00:01:10.010
Charles of economics and now well it's

29
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.010
growing into something of a rock star

30
00:01:10.04 --> 00:01:13.700
[Music]

31
00:01:11.75 --> 00:01:15.500
so today's question is well what

32
00:01:13.7 --> 00:01:18.080
happened to this country which improved

33
00:01:15.5 --> 00:01:20.090
their image in such a short time can

34
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:22.160
they really become the leader of the

35
00:01:20.09 --> 00:01:24.830
lithium race and most important of all

36
00:01:22.16 --> 00:01:27.110
can lithium turn Argentina into a new

37
00:01:24.83 --> 00:01:28.850
Ally's Derby today we are going to

38
00:01:27.11 --> 00:01:31.160
answer all of these questions but before

39
00:01:28.85 --> 00:01:36.350
we get started let's take a look at the

40
00:01:31.16 --> 00:01:37.880
history Argentina first in the last few

41
00:01:36.35 --> 00:01:39.530
years Argentina become something of a

42
00:01:37.88 --> 00:01:41.330
bogeyman for hedge funds under the

43
00:01:39.53 --> 00:01:43.340
presidency of Cristina Fernandez de

44
00:01:41.33 --> 00:01:45.140
Kirchner Argentina's government did

45
00:01:43.34 --> 00:01:47.300
whatever they could to scare away any

46
00:01:45.14 --> 00:01:50.660
foreign company who might want to invest

47
00:01:47.3 --> 00:01:52.760
in the country Kabongo Satrangi rose

economic ozl picado delle speculation

50
00:01:55.84 --> 00:01:59.750
when it comes to the mining and oil

51
00:01:57.92 --> 00:02:02.240
industry Kirchner made an interesting

52
00:01:59.75 --> 00:02:04.580
move in 2008 she passed a law against

53
00:02:02.24 --> 00:02:06.320
the repatriation of capital this means

54
00:02:04.58 --> 00:02:08.300
that if an Australian mining company

55
00:02:06.32 --> 00:02:10.610
made profit by extracting oil or

56
00:02:08.3 --> 00:02:12.110
minerals on Argentinian soil the

57
00:02:10.61 --> 00:02:15.440
government wouldn't allow the company to

58
00:02:12.11 --> 00:02:17.360
send that money back to Australia

59
00:02:15.44 --> 00:02:19.100
Kercher's goal was to force these

60
00:02:17.36 --> 00:02:21.050
foreign companies to keep the financial

61
00:02:19.1 --> 00:02:23.120
benefits of their mining in the country

62
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:25.100
masa the last times you can imagine the

63
00:02:23.12 --> 00:02:26.690
consequence of this law was that most of

64
00:02:25.1 --> 00:02:29.000
the foreign companies simply stopped

65
00:02:26.69 --> 00:02:31.130
doing business in the country at the end

66
00:02:29.0 --> 00:02:33.140
of the day I mean why would they if it

67
00:02:31.13 --> 00:02:35.900
was forbidden to enjoy those profits at

68
00:02:33.14 --> 00:02:38.000
home but well this it was not enough the

69
00:02:35.9 --> 00:02:39.860
real turning point for Argentina came in

70
00:02:38.0 --> 00:02:41.540
the year 2012

71
00:02:39.86 --> 00:02:44.610
[Music]

72
00:02:41.54 --> 00:02:46.680
Argentina expropriate swipe ef-2 Repsol

73
00:02:44.61 --> 00:02:49.080
revs all the largest oil company in

74
00:02:46.68 --> 00:02:52.200
Spain in the year 1998 merged with

75
00:02:49.08 --> 00:02:54.840
Argentine company of yef for many years

76
00:02:52.2 --> 00:02:56.940
this brand was simply called Repsol ytf

77
00:02:54.84 --> 00:02:58.980
but one day Cristina Fernandez de

78
00:02:56.94 --> 00:03:01.470
Kirchner in a very Donald Trump s

79
00:02:58.98 --> 00:03:03.780
fashion said well Argentina first

80
00:03:01.47 --> 00:03:07.170
hashtag make Argentina great again

81
00:03:03.78 --> 00:03:09.209
callosum press a key Stan a key I won't

82
00:03:07.17 --> 00:03:10.920
want to suffer let's stay here even if

83
00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.829
their shareholders are foreigners are

84
00:03:10.92 --> 00:03:16.560
Argentinian companies and now you might

85
00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.120
wonder well what happened next well of

86
00:03:16.56 --> 00:03:19.650
course the reptile refused several

87
00:03:18.12 --> 00:03:22.019
lawsuits with the government of

88
00:03:19.65 --> 00:03:23.819
Argentina but this was not the worst

89
00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.609
thing the biggest problem was that after

90
00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.500
being nationalized Argentine ydf reduced

91
00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.560
their oil production

92
00:03:28.5 --> 00:03:36.599
[Music]

93
00:03:33.56 --> 00:03:38.940
the oil production extends decline as

94
00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.840
rig activity slows yeah yeah listen I

95
00:03:38.94 --> 00:03:41.489
know you're thinking you're probably

96
00:03:39.84 --> 00:03:43.709
thinking what's the connection between

97
00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.840
oil production and being owned by

98
00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.489
private companies or being owned by the

99
00:03:45.84 --> 00:03:49.140
government I mean there are several

100
00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.209
state-owned oil companies that work

101
00:03:49.14 --> 00:03:53.040
really well for one example there is a

102
00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.650
ram code this is the biggest dinosaur

103
00:03:53.04 --> 00:03:57.659
juice producer and filled that is owned

104
00:03:55.65 --> 00:04:00.180
by the Saudi government the problem here

105
00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:04.670
is that both in the oil and the mining

106
00:04:00.18 --> 00:04:04.670
industry you need high tech yeah

107
00:04:04.76 --> 00:04:09.359
each company has different technologies

108
00:04:07.26 --> 00:04:11.579
and patterns in other words when ydf

109
00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.440
wants to drill those oil beds of bakker

110
00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.480
water they needed to utilize a

111
00:04:13.44 --> 00:04:17.549
complicated technology called fracking

112
00:04:15.48 --> 00:04:19.919
and well there are only a few companies

113
00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.900
in the world that have the machines and

114
00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.880
the skills to do this kind of work this

115
00:04:21.9 --> 00:04:26.250
is why it is so common the difference

116
00:04:23.88 --> 00:04:28.530
oil companies create in joint venture to

117
00:04:26.25 --> 00:04:30.060
exploit an oil bet when Repsol left

118
00:04:28.53 --> 00:04:31.860
Argentina why do you have lost a

119
00:04:30.06 --> 00:04:33.539
technology partner and this is why

120
00:04:31.86 --> 00:04:35.850
people say that curtain afford against

121
00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:39.770
those Spanish neoliberal and ended up

122
00:04:35.85 --> 00:04:39.770
partnering with the American ones

123
00:04:40.52 --> 00:04:46.740
Chevron y PF signed 1.5 billion dollar

124
00:04:44.25 --> 00:04:48.360
shale oil deal but hold on just a second

125
00:04:46.74 --> 00:04:50.220
because well this isn't the end of our

126
00:04:48.36 --> 00:04:51.780
story the biggest issue here is what

127
00:04:50.22 --> 00:04:54.150
happens when you take over a company

128
00:04:51.78 --> 00:04:55.410
from one day to the other well what

129
00:04:54.15 --> 00:04:57.450
happens is the rest of the businesses

130
00:04:55.41 --> 00:04:59.310
are going to be afraid of you and good

131
00:04:57.45 --> 00:05:00.870
luck trying to convince them to invest

132
00:04:59.31 --> 00:05:02.840
in your country

133
00:05:00.87 --> 00:05:05.550
[Music]

134
00:05:02.84 --> 00:05:07.770
think about it let's imagine you have an

135
00:05:05.55 --> 00:05:09.300
oil or a mining company would you really

136
00:05:07.77 --> 00:05:10.530
dare set up a factory and a lot of

137
00:05:09.3 --> 00:05:12.150
facilities in a place where the

138
00:05:10.53 --> 00:05:15.419
government can just see all of that from

139
00:05:12.15 --> 00:05:17.669
you I think not and this among other

140
00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.430
factors is what explains why Argentina

141
00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.810
today has such a big crisis but are now

142
00:05:20.43 --> 00:05:25.169
Argentina has a president called

143
00:05:21.81 --> 00:05:28.070
Mauricio Macri and well the times they

144
00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.070
are a-changin

145
00:05:30.74 --> 00:05:36.960
white gold rush in Argentina in December

146
00:05:34.38 --> 00:05:38.790
2015 macaroni took his place in the pink

147
00:05:36.96 --> 00:05:41.970
house the thing else is the Argentine

148
00:05:38.79 --> 00:05:45.840
version of the white house only sort of

149
00:05:41.97 --> 00:05:48.180
Liguria confounder country in the middle

150
00:05:45.84 --> 00:05:50.190
of bankruptcy real inflation with higher

151
00:05:48.18 --> 00:05:52.320
than 40 percent dollars were sold on the

152
00:05:50.19 --> 00:05:54.480
black market and there was no company

153
00:05:52.32 --> 00:05:56.430
willing to invest in the country and all

154
00:05:54.48 --> 00:05:58.200
of this was despite them being one of

155
00:05:56.43 --> 00:06:00.360
the wealthiest countries when it comes

156
00:05:58.2 --> 00:06:03.060
to natural resources this is why since

157
00:06:00.36 --> 00:06:06.360
the very first moment Macri is trying to

158
00:06:03.06 --> 00:06:10.740
conduct a 180 degree shift compared to

159
00:06:06.36 --> 00:06:12.900
what its predecessor Argentina's new

160
00:06:10.74 --> 00:06:14.850
government scraps mining taxes in other

161
00:06:12.9 --> 00:06:17.040
words Macri knows that lithium is a

162
00:06:14.85 --> 00:06:18.720
peerless opportunity to repair the

163
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:20.790
accounting verse of course now no one

164
00:06:18.72 --> 00:06:23.760
expects Argentina to become a new de by

165
00:06:20.79 --> 00:06:25.680
overnight but this white gold isn't huge

166
00:06:23.76 --> 00:06:27.540
windfall and that money could cover the

167
00:06:25.68 --> 00:06:29.910
gaps of Argentina's budget without

168
00:06:27.54 --> 00:06:32.610
raising taxes and without cutting cost

169
00:06:29.91 --> 00:06:37.979
and well this explains laws like this

170
00:06:32.61 --> 00:06:40.229
one Argentina signs mining deal to unify

171
00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.270
regulations attract investment in other

172
00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.070
words from now on mining multinationals

173
00:06:42.27 --> 00:06:46.110
have an open door to the country and

174
00:06:44.07 --> 00:06:48.030
unlike what happens with the Kirchner

175
00:06:46.11 --> 00:06:49.620
era these foreign companies can do

176
00:06:48.03 --> 00:06:51.539
whatever they want with their profits

177
00:06:49.62 --> 00:06:54.330
this is happening it because Macri has

178
00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.680
removed the anti riparian law and if

179
00:06:54.33 --> 00:06:57.630
this is not enough legislation has been

180
00:06:55.68 --> 00:06:59.700
put in effect which unifies mining

181
00:06:57.63 --> 00:07:01.620
regulations all across the country this

182
00:06:59.7 --> 00:07:03.990
means that the rules are the same no

183
00:07:01.62 --> 00:07:05.490
matter where the lithium bed is further

184
00:07:03.99 --> 00:07:09.080
the mining companies will not have to

185
00:07:05.49 --> 00:07:11.730
pay any special mining tax any more

building new lithium operations in

191
00:07:22.71 --> 00:07:25.130
Argentina

192
00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.229
supposed to hold on for just a second

193
00:07:27.77 --> 00:07:33.199
because well things they are not quite

194
00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:36.199
as great as they seem look listen is a

195
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.210
great opportunity for Argentina but as

196
00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.279
you know having natural resources does

197
00:07:38.21 --> 00:07:42.710
not mean your country is necessarily

198
00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:45.050
wealthy many Argentinian fear what they

199
00:07:42.71 --> 00:07:46.340
would call a new potosi this means that

200
00:07:45.05 --> 00:07:47.719
they fear that their country would

201
00:07:46.34 --> 00:07:49.789
become flooded with foreign companies

202
00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:51.949
that take the resources and leave

203
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:53.749
without bringing any money into

204
00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.810
Argentina so the question now becomes

205
00:07:53.749 --> 00:08:07.840
well what can Argentina do to avoid such

206
00:07:56.81 --> 00:08:10.699
a catastrophe a real chance of Argentina

207
00:08:07.84 --> 00:08:12.979
as we said in a previous video the real

208
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:15.349
business of lithium is not lithium

209
00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:16.710
itself but the added value products you

210
00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:19.800
can manufacture with it

211
00:08:16.71 --> 00:08:19.800
[Music]

212
00:08:20.58 --> 00:08:25.210
at the time when we recorded this video

213
00:08:23.14 --> 00:08:28.330
a metric ton of lithium had a market

214
00:08:25.21 --> 00:08:29.800
price of $9,000 nevertheless if we take

215
00:08:28.33 --> 00:08:31.810
that raw material and we turn it into

216
00:08:29.8 --> 00:08:34.840
mobile phone batteries we could get an

217
00:08:31.81 --> 00:08:37.300
income of between 1.5 and 5 million

218
00:08:34.84 --> 00:08:39.310
dollars of course this is a very rough

219
00:08:37.3 --> 00:08:43.360
estimation but it does help us

220
00:08:39.31 --> 00:08:45.340
understand something important but hold

221
00:08:43.36 --> 00:08:46.510
on just a moment because this is still

222
00:08:45.34 --> 00:08:48.250
not as simple as it looks

223
00:08:46.51 --> 00:08:49.840
most of the lithium battery factories

224
00:08:48.25 --> 00:08:52.180
are in countries like the United States

225
00:08:49.84 --> 00:08:54.010
Germany or of course China these three

226
00:08:52.18 --> 00:08:56.050
countries have world-class network of

227
00:08:54.01 --> 00:08:58.180
small companies that provide services

228
00:08:56.05 --> 00:09:01.260
and components to the big manufacturing

229
00:08:58.18 --> 00:09:03.490
plant we're talking about logistics

230
00:09:01.26 --> 00:09:05.350
semiconductors and so on all of these

231
00:09:03.49 --> 00:09:07.270
things make the manufacturing process

232
00:09:05.35 --> 00:09:08.890
cheaper and more efficient but not only

233
00:09:07.27 --> 00:09:10.960
that this network effect is what

234
00:09:08.89 --> 00:09:12.850
attracts the best engineers and skilled

235
00:09:10.96 --> 00:09:14.350
professionals to these countries this is

236
00:09:12.85 --> 00:09:18.420
a central if you want to create a

237
00:09:14.35 --> 00:09:18.420
high-tech industry in a country

238
00:09:18.63 --> 00:09:22.650
I mean look good luck trying to convince

239
00:09:20.94 --> 00:09:24.510
a woman who lives in San Francisco and

240
00:09:22.65 --> 00:09:27.030
makes a six-figure salary to move to

241
00:09:24.51 --> 00:09:29.820
Rosario Argentina to work in a factory

242
00:09:27.03 --> 00:09:34.500
as you can imagine that's pretty much

243
00:09:29.82 --> 00:09:37.380
impossible so now you might be wondering

244
00:09:34.5 --> 00:09:38.880
what can we do to industrialize his

245
00:09:37.38 --> 00:09:40.680
country well the first thing we have to

246
00:09:38.88 --> 00:09:42.630
keep in mind is that Silicon Valley it

247
00:09:40.68 --> 00:09:44.940
was not created in a day nevertheless

248
00:09:42.63 --> 00:09:47.340
Argentina have a great advantage over

249
00:09:44.94 --> 00:09:49.590
California they can make easy money by

250
00:09:47.34 --> 00:09:51.270
selling raw lithium of course this money

251
00:09:49.59 --> 00:09:52.920
can be used by the government to simply

252
00:09:51.27 --> 00:09:54.330
boost their earnings but it is also a

253
00:09:52.92 --> 00:09:55.830
good opportunity to invest in

254
00:09:54.33 --> 00:09:57.810
universities that will train those

255
00:09:55.83 --> 00:09:59.640
workers that might start those small

256
00:09:57.81 --> 00:10:03.170
companies that are needed in order to

257
00:09:59.64 --> 00:10:05.190
get the big factories up and running

258
00:10:03.17 --> 00:10:07.350
services the government can also Co

259
00:10:05.19 --> 00:10:09.240
finance brand new businesses this is

260
00:10:07.35 --> 00:10:11.340
actually the formula that helps Israel

261
00:10:09.24 --> 00:10:13.650
become a technological capital as well

262
00:10:11.34 --> 00:10:16.530
so far it seems that Macri is committed

263
00:10:13.65 --> 00:10:19.140
to working this way we have learned we

264
00:10:16.53 --> 00:10:23.550
have understand that in addition to our

265
00:10:19.14 --> 00:10:27.120
talents our huge natural resources we

266
00:10:23.55 --> 00:10:29.860
have to add constantly you have to add

267
00:10:27.12 --> 00:10:34.309
rule of law to be predictable

268
00:10:29.86 --> 00:10:34.309
[Music]

269
00:10:34.94 --> 00:10:39.890
but wait a minute because there are some

270
00:10:37.85 --> 00:10:41.960
dark clouds on the horizon all these

271
00:10:39.89 --> 00:10:44.540
opportunities Argentina has will

272
00:10:41.96 --> 00:10:46.640
disappear if McCree or whoever follows

273
00:10:44.54 --> 00:10:48.530
him falls back into the temptation of

274
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:50.630
destroying the rule of law and going

275
00:10:48.53 --> 00:10:52.670
back to ultra-nationalism which could

276
00:10:50.63 --> 00:10:54.410
scare away foreigners as it has in many

277
00:10:52.67 --> 00:10:56.420
other countries and it seems the

278
00:10:54.41 --> 00:10:58.580
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner wants to

279
00:10:56.42 --> 00:11:01.220
run the office again in a simple people

280
00:10:58.58 --> 00:11:03.260
not asking you to vote for me ok but

281
00:11:01.22 --> 00:11:05.990
then I locate I am not asking you to

282
00:11:03.26 --> 00:11:10.820
vote for the people behind me I am

283
00:11:05.99 --> 00:11:11.630
asking you to vote for yourself so well

284
00:11:10.82 --> 00:11:13.340
now it's your turn

285
00:11:11.63 --> 00:11:15.200
do you think Argentina could restore the

286
00:11:13.34 --> 00:11:16.940
rule of Lorentz become a wealthy country

287
00:11:15.2 --> 00:11:19.460
thanks to lithium nor are we going to

288
00:11:16.94 --> 00:11:21.800
see a new nationalist backlash and a

289
00:11:19.46 --> 00:11:23.840
brand new economic crisis well you can

leave your answer in the comment section

291
00:11:23.84 --> 00:11:27.890
below and just before you go today I got

292
00:11:25.55 --> 00:11:29.570
an important request from you you might

293
00:11:27.89 --> 00:11:31.490
have noticed that we rather like using

294
00:11:29.57 --> 00:11:33.110
rock music in our videos and we'd love

295
00:11:31.49 --> 00:11:34.460
to hear from anyone who has a band and

296
00:11:33.11 --> 00:11:36.560
thinks that their music could be a good

297
00:11:34.46 --> 00:11:38.180
fit for us we will of course give credit

298
00:11:36.56 --> 00:11:40.220
to any music that we do use in a video

299
00:11:38.18 --> 00:11:42.650
