[Music]

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,040
South Korea is one of the most liberal

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,440
and democratic countries in Asia as well

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,480
as being not surprisingly one of the

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,250
most connected and technologically

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,020
advanced countries in the world the

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,700
contrast with its impoverished and

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,460
tyrannical northern neighbor is striking

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,259
like the difference between well night

12
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:33,660
and day and in fact here on visual

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,250
politic we've already talked about some

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,010
of these differences in various videos

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,450
but this time I'm not gonna talk about

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,149
the South Korean economy orb anything

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:43,829
like that in this video we're gonna talk

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,660
about the internet you've probably heard

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,190
that South Korea is the number one

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,020
country in the world in terms of volume

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,570
of online connections well check this

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:00,540
out South Korea has the most users

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,340
connected to fiber-optic networks almost

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,500
31 percent of its entire population in

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,079
addition 96 percent of South Koreans

26
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,970
have access to the Internet the largest

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,990
percentage on the planet by the way

28
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,700
they're also the third biggest social

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,530
network users no less than 85 percent of

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,570
all South Koreans use them regularly to

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,340
give you a better idea this compares

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,920
with about 70 percent in the United

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,909
States

34
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,090
and that is not all nowadays it's also

35
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,399
the country that markets the fastest

36
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,439
internet speed that's two point five

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,369
gigs down that will soon become ten gigs

38
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,719
if that weren't enough it's the country

39
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,399
with the highest smartphone penetration

40
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,759
in the world 94% of South Koreans have

41
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:54,649
one basically South Korea is super super

42
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,509
connected but as if that wasn't enough

43
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:59,240
Korea wit or not the south of course has

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,399
the most implemented 4G network in the

45
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,380
world and has been one of the first

46
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,409
countries to now have the famous 5g

47
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,450
connection but all right you know enough

48
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:16,849
facts you get the picture South Korea

49
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:19,069
boasts amazing technological development

50
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,079
and an envy of all telecommunication

51
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,180
market but as we like to say on visual

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,430
politic take a closer look because not

53
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,890
everything that glitters is necessarily

54
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,680
gold

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,280
[Music]

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,780
according to the NGO freedom house which

57
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,640
creates an annual benchmark index on

58
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,560
network freedom South Korea barely

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,260
reaches the harshali free status this

60
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,120
basically puts it at the same level as

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,730
countries like Nigeria or Kyrgyzstan

62
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,220
which as everyone knows our amazing

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,530
democracies but that raises the question

64
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,720
what exactly is happening in South Korea

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,340
why do they have such a low level of

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,230
Network freedom well in this video we're

67
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,000
going to discuss a not so well-known

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
South Korean problem and that's

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,700
government control of the Internet

70
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,270
a censorship tradition

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,120
all countries they have their angels and

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,530
they have their demons and of course

73
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,190
South Korea is no different

74
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,200
South Korean democracy is very recent

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,710
dabeli in 1988 and is still an imperfect

76
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,980
democracy throughout its short life fans

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,350
without exception each and every one of

78
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,150
its Democratic presidents has had a

79
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,580
clear tendency towards censorship and

80
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,140
information control whether due to a

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,150
lack of political culture or because of

82
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,920
moral and cultural issues a link to

83
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,780
their Confucian past a state is still

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,030
very very paternalistic and there's a

85
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,260
strong hierarchical vision of society

86
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,910
this means that elders and bosses they

87
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,050
are never questioned in addition there's

88
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,340
a strong sense of community in

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,470
comparison to the more individualistic

90
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,450
and less rigid societies of the West

91
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,100
this really explains why the country's

92
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,990
leaders felt justified in controlling

93
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,049
certain aspects often too many of

94
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,090
people's lives they've also limited

95
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,950
their citizens ability to express

96
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,200
themselves freely all this is of course

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,140
in the name of the common good this

98
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,670
often involves controlling freedom of

99
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,560
speech and of course limiting criticisms

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,630
of authority figures or the ruling party

101
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,400
of the moment however the government

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,130
uses two issues in particular to justify

103
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,050
all of its censorship activity

104
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,060
protection against North Korea and

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,570
public morals

106
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,020
[Music]

107
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,430
you see in order to block content the

108
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,050
government resorts to the national

109
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,090
security law a law that among other

110
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,460
things prohibits communism in practice

111
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,650
as well as any declaration in favor of

112
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,750
North Korea or subversive ideas that

113
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,040
encourage the elimination of the state

114
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,840
this law not only applies in the

115
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,639
physical world but also in cyberspace

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,650
for example blocking or closing any

117
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,690
webpages that speak in favor of the

118
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,800
North's regime and then there's another

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,660
key factor that is becoming more and

120
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,880
more important lately and that's a ban

121
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,730
on pornography yep yeah that right South

122
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,260
Korea is one of a few countries in the

123
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,390
world where pornography is explicitly

124
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,100
prohibited specifically it's been

125
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,440
prohibited since 2008 specifically it's

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,910
not actually just pornography but it's

127
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,280
also gambling as many online games have

128
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,200
been blocked under the pretext of being

129
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,950
indecent websites but don't think that

130
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,290
this is new not at all see a few years

131
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,690
ago between 2001 and 2003 the then

132
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,490
governments of the center-left Nobel

133
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,830
Prize winner Kim died Jung said about

134
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,930
blocking websites with homosexual

135
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,700
content as if there was no tomorrow

136
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,490
because they were literally spaces of

137
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,470
obscenity and perversion quite a mild

138
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,539
statement there now of course if you

139
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,880
want to be an a sensor that is you want

140
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
to chop and change the internet to suit

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,960
your views you need to organize yourself

142
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,710
[Applause]

143
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,140
it is precisely due to this that in 2008

144
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,060
the conservative president Lee myung-bak

145
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,460
created a public body to control the

146
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,100
Internet the Korea Communications

147
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,740
Standards Commission or KC SC tonenpaul

148
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,180
inclusion yunjeong

149
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,879
ee ho song Amida

150
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,069
this commission has the power to block

151
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:31,169
and even close websites without even

152
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,689
requiring a court order the problem is

153
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,369
that instead of moving towards an

154
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,319
increasingly free Internet South Korea

155
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,569
seems to be heading backwards at full

156
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,439
speed the most recent figures from 2017

157
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,360
on websites blocked and eliminated by

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,659
the case ESC are pretty scary nearly 67

159
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,819
thousand websites were blocked ins more

160
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,729
than 18,000 were eliminated in a single

161
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,469
year and with this kind of information

162
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,449
you could really say the things are

163
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,389
getting out of hands it's scary to see

164
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,610
politicians blocking and closing

165
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,060
websites of will

166
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,420
[Music]

167
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,820
and on top of that 2017 was the first

168
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,350
year since the Commission began to

169
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,450
operate in 2008 in which the number of

170
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,550
blocked and deleted web pages decreased

171
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,350
just a little in other words it was

172
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,690
actually a good year hmm but having

173
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,340
reached this point the question that

174
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,590
comes to mind is how is South Korea

175
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,960
censoring the internet how far can the

176
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,340
government go to prevent the population

177
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,580
from accessing the immoral and what's

178
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,710
even more important could visual politic

179
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,140
be considered to be an immoral website

180
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:47,600
well let's see

181
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,980
Tangled independent sensor

182
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,440
the truth is that censorship in the

183
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,750
South Korean Network is very serious and

184
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,240
it is not transparent and the key to all

185
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,390
of this is the kc SC which i mentioned

186
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,710
just a moment ago this so-called

187
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,670
independent commission is nestled within

188
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,800
another Korea's Communications

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,740
Commission or KCC the ke CSU regulates

190
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,020
the internet and the KCC regulates all

191
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,820
means of communication and the key

192
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,910
question is how do they work well the

193
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,310
KCC has five members two of which aren't

194
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,410
directly appointed by the South Korean

195
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,720
president including its director the

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,980
other three are appointed by the

197
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,870
National Assembly the country's

198
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,820
parliament so as you can absolutely see

199
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,040
it's a non-political and unbiased

200
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,720
Commission which is all rather

201
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,600
independence in this way the KC SC the

202
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,490
Commission that regulates the Internet

203
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,500
is responsible for identifying websites

204
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
that violate any law sites such as

205
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,300
pro-north websites pornography or online

206
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,070
gambling but also anything that the

207
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,770
agency considers as cyber defamation or

208
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,930
anti military content that's when a

209
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,820
Content deletion blocking or total

210
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,830
closure of the website request is issued

211
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,960
to the KCC which transmits it to the

212
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,270
media service provider who must comply

213
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,830
with the order and these kinds of

214
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,350
requests they aren't often rejected

215
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,330
however officially the service provider

216
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,700
has 15 days to appeal the request the

217
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,440
truth is that after the deadline it is

218
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,810
the KC SC you decides what sanctions and

219
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,610
punishments will be applied based on the

220
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,010
law and the content in question and do

221
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,590
keep in mind here that no judge at any

222
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,110
point interferes with this process so

223
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,090
what do you think of this to us it just

224
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,920
sounds like outright censorship which

225
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,110
clashes with the foundations of freedom

226
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,459
and democracy

227
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,500
that's not all in 2017 a new president

228
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,060
came to power human rights lawyer moon

229
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,800
jae-in seized power after a shady

230
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,180
corruption scandal involving his

231
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,800
conservative predecessor Park geun-hye

232
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,060
many in the Western media painted him as

233
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,529
a reformer who would bring new progress

234
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,899
to the country but is it really like

235
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,560
this in the field of Internet freedom

236
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,170
well no I can conclusively tell you that

237
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,510
this is not the case so listen up

238
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,110
[Music]

239
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,339
hoonjae a heavy hand and a pretty face

240
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,560
you saw here on this channel first in a

241
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,389
previous video we criticized moon jae-in

242
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,550
for his economic management's but what

243
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,500
about individual liberties and more

244
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,329
specifically the internet because we're

245
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,800
basically talking about a center-left

246
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,810
politician who has been trying to convey

247
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,970
the image that South Korea has overcome

248
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,100
a dark era of corruption after the

249
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,570
scandals of his predecessor Park he did

250
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,220
this with a campaign that washed his

251
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,920
image with quite populist dyes it's a

252
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,540
campaign with which he obtained a

253
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,490
chilling approval rating of 80 percent

254
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,290
among the South Koreans at the beginning

255
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,420
of his mandate quite the popular forever

256
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,520
there

257
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,710
in addition is dialogues with North

258
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,690
Korea and summits with Kim jong-un who

259
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,940
have also helped him be seen as a man of

260
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,130
peace and reconciliation both inside and

261
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,380
outside of Korea but also on justice

262
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,560
because really is it all as rosy as it

263
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,470
seems well know if his economic

264
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,850
management is already leaving quite a

265
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,920
lot to be desired in terms of individual

266
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,170
liberties and Network freedom he is not

267
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,040
doing too well either censorship is a

268
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,850
bipartisan pursuit in South Korea yes

269
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,740
according to a report by the Jun yang

270
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,180
Lee Bo one of the three largest

271
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,130
newspapers in South Korea censorship in

272
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,410
the moon' era has expanded even more in

273
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,180
the political arena for example the moon

274
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,620
government withdrew funding from the

275
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,330
only think-tank in the United States

276
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,340
that specializes in Korean issues the

277
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,130
u.s. Career Institute or the u.s. ki why

278
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,620
well it didn't have to do with austerity

279
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,600
but with the u.s. ki being critical of

280
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,910
moons overly friendly attitudes with Kim

281
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,480
jong-un and his North Korean regime

282
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,580
green think-tank at u.s. university to

283
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,910
close after Seoul withdraws funding

284
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,070
[Music]

285
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,050
mind you the problem isn't that he

286
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,000
withdrew financing from a think tank in

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
Washington but the idea of using public

288
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
money to reward friends and punish

289
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
critics but that's not all the most

290
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,850
serious and most worrisome points that

291
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,440
the international community is the new

292
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,389
form of censorship that moons government

293
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:24,190
is implemented on the Internet it is

294
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,290
considered Chinese style censorship

295
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,790
because it's the same method that

296
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,459
Beijing uses to block websites yeah you

297
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,300
heard that right

298
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,089
South Korea is copying China in terms of

299
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,459
freedoms you probably didn't expect that

300
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:40,990
one since the start of this year 2019

301
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,790
the South Korean government has begun to

302
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,459
open date packages from encrypted HTTPS

303
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,769
websites servers which are considered to

304
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,470
be the safest the que CSC used server

305
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,079
name identification or SN is Pia nosh to

306
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,050
block 895 websites in February using

307
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,889
this method

308
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,360
one of the websites blocked with this

309
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,370
method was for example the largest

310
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,440
pornographic website in the world but

311
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,959
how does this method work well we'll

312
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,699
check this out if the user tries to

313
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:08,860
access an HTTPS website considered

314
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,930
harmful by the government the KC SC

315
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,940
opens the date packages defined the

316
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,740
server whose information is not

317
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,899
encrypted that way by knowing the server

318
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,790
the government can block access to these

319
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,240
harmful sites

320
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,830
[Music]

321
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,089
that's not old if the government comes

322
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,560
up with the key to decrypt the

323
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,330
information it can even specifically see

324
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,160
your internet visits and access personal

325
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,649
information such as your IP address in

326
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,540
short moons government could be spying

327
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,130
on every packet of data that South

328
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,200
Korean citizens receive and then they

329
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,910
could choose to block access if it's an

330
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,950
unauthorized page that is they can

331
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,510
control what each person does on the

332
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,610
internet as an individual level makes us

333
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,110
answer the question of whether South

334
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,610
Koreans have any privacy with a

335
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,660
resounding no and it goes without saying

336
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,940
that this is not typical of democratic

337
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,950
regimes or leaders with a conciliatory

338
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,529
image such as moons but here a visual

339
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,390
politic we really do love South Korea

340
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,740
and we really believe that it's an

341
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,380
exemplary country in most aspects it's

342
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,450
precisely because we love it that we're

343
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,399
worried about this lack of networked

344
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,870
freedom but I was your turn is the

345
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,730
censorship and espionage of Internet

346
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,620
users justified in order to maintain

347
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,540
morals what do you think about the

348
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,250
online control framework that South

349
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,230
Korea has developed it's been really

350
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,580
committed to freedom well leave your

to understand your society but I'm

380
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,209
confused by South Korea South Korea is

381
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,430
one of the few developed nations with

382
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,260
internet censorship well they're one of

383
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,880
the only countries to admit that they

384
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,950
have it in America Google and Facebook

385
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,230
only have technical difficulties if

386
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,250
you're conservative

387
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,329
you should use this to your advantage so

388
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,439

policy here yo babe every one of your

393
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,829
accounts is deleted for hate speech

394
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:50,049
South Korea's internet censorship on

395
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,809
porn distribution of porn is a two-year

396
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:55,929
felony even the word homosexuality is

397
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,029
banned from libraries what I want to

398
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,860
know is do they put all the porn

399
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,350
offenders in the same prison if so that

400
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,850
might motivate them to break the law

401
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,879
faster I'm here for porn I'm here for

402
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,350
porn - homosexual porn what's that word

403
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,299
mean I never taught it to me at the

404
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,139
library

405
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,139
why is internet censorship bizarre for

406
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,449
South Korea when it exists in other

407
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,699
places on your planet well in South

408
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:23,439
Korea it's so bizarre because they're a

409
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,509
global leader in communication

410
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:28,509
technology dude is it true that Samsung

411
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,089
invented a telepathy machine nobody

412
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:32,319
knows if it works or not

413
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,299
because we can't go six seconds without

414
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,220
thinking about sex and then our thoughts

415
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,290
are blocked another huge part of South

416
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,029
Korea's censorship is to stop the

417
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,579
influence of the north however if I were

418
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,199
Kim jong-eun I'd abuse the South

419
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,269
censorship to transmit covert military

420
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,489
intelligence to my own troops because

421
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,350
nothing could be intercepted so long as

422
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,079
every message sounded like a porn script

423
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,610
captain I've intercepted a transmission

424
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,160
that says the hard rocket is about to

425
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,649
blow prematurely on the rear you can't

426
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,689
look at that shut it down but it's

427
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,399
urgent I know how to enforce our

428
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,130
censorship hold that up

429
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,490
I will have Donald Trump's immigration

430
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,250
policy all right now functioned that was

431
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,230
a clip from hypocrite twins like I said

432
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,880

433
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,069
