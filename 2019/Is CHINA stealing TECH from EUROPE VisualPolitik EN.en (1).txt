00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,070
away the Canadian police arrested her at

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,989
the end of 2018 four years gave a

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,760
preview of some of the arguments they'll

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,380
be making once her extradition hearing

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,989
begins the main reason was because of

16
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,610
alleged violations of America's

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,969
sanctions on Iran but there is more to

18
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:46,800
the story than this the Trump

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,480
administration believes China is using

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
their technology to spy on American

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,030
citizens but is this just Donald Trump's

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,410
obsession or are there legitimate

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,250
reasons to be scared of China China

24
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,859
China China I have to have my China

25
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,379
China China because China China China

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,420
China you see whenever we speak about

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,790
the military we always talk about air

28
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,930
and sea and land nowadays though we

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,580
should add another field technology

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,759
ships cameras drones all of these kinds

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,040
of innovations have revolutionized

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,010
modern warfare

33
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,960
[Music]

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,700
as we told you in our previous videos

35
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,979
China is facing an existential threat

36
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,460
and therefore it needs to expand the

37
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,260
military this is why they created what

38
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,900
has been called the string of pearls

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,940
strategy this is a set of ports that can

40
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,070
double as military bases that would go

41
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,009
from the South China Sea to Africa and

42
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,810
in another video we told you about what

43
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,720
we like to call sugar-daddy diplomacy

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,060
but still there is something important

45
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,159
that China is missing for their military

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,190
expansion and that's technology and

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,899
catching up with the West in this field

48
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:04,149
it's not easy and again Xi Jingping

49
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:06,009
is showing his lateral thinking on this

50
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,590
issue how is he doing that well that is

51
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,869
what we are going to tell you in this

52
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:11,510
video

53
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,060
[Applause]

54
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,690
[Music]

55
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,430
China the country famous for making

56
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,710
cheap copies of anything that you can

57
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,410
imagine like these copyright violating

58
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,280
weapon bricks with the star Warner's

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,280
logo on them is that how you pronounce

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,300
it who really knows

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,810
[Music]

62
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,610
but make no mistake china's

63
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,040
technological prowess goes way beyond

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,530
that in 2015 china's government unveiled

65
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,040
made in china 2025 a ten year plan to

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,319
update the state's manufacturing base by

67
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,630
rapidly developing ten high-tech

68
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,190
industries chief among these are

69
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,260
electric cars and other new energy

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,060
vehicles next generation information

71
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,069
technology and telecommunications and

72
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,250
last but certainly not least advanced

73
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,050
robotics and artificial intelligence

74
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,630
these sectors are central to the

75
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,430
so-called fourth Industrial Revolution

76
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,130
which is the new buzz word to use when

77
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,739
AI want to look smarter soon there won't

78
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,019
be a single talk show or political

79
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,600
debate that isn't talking about it say

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,220
pay attention the fourth Industrial

81
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,440
Revolution refers to the integration of

82
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,440
big data and cloud computing into global

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,550
manufacturing supply chains made in

84
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,970
China 2025 is Beijing's plan for

85
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,100
high-tech dominance as big a threat as

86
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,350
the West thinks it is the plan is to

87
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,269
reduce dependence on foreign technology

88
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,400
yeah it is true most of the mobile

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,380
phones you can buy are assembled in

90
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,910
China but the majority of the high-tech

91
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,130
components the cameras the high-end

92
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,260
microchips all of that is made in

93
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,150
countries like America Germany or Japan

94
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,760
so far China doesn't have the technology

95
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,950
to produce these components itself and

96
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,200
that's why this desire to become a tech

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,590
superpower is part of the so-called

98
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,160
Chinese dream

99
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,989
the Chinese dream is closely linked to

100
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,580
the dreams of people in other countries

101
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,980
China's development is facilitated by

102
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,750
the development of the world and it will

103
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,609
bring about greater impetus and

104
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,859
opportunities for the common progress of

105
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,980
all countries President Xi Jinping

106
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,470
October 22nd 2015 and now China is

107
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,880
trying to make another Silicon Valley

108
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,680
the city of Nanjing for example is

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,780
currently developing a research park to

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,760
foster China's next generation of tech

111
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,860
giants we're talking about an area as

112
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,200
big as Seattle housing dozens of

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,970
high-profile startups and companies and

114
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,130
that's just one big city it's worth

115
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,050
noting that this comes with the support

116
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,910
of the Chinese government and this

117
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,610
support comes with heavy regulations

118
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,010
businesses must meet certain criteria in

119
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,720
order to qualify for tax relief and

120
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,360
other support and there's even more here

121
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,370
besides providing subsidies and setting

122
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,960
targets how does China intend to achieve

123
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,280
its goals by investing or directly

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,410
buying American and European startups

125
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,450
Chinese companies both private and state

126
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,400
backed have been encouraged to invest in

127
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,870
foreign companies in order to gain

128
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,419
access to advanced technology in 2016

129
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,490
alone the value of Chinese acquisitions

130
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,039
in the United States amounted to over 45

131
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,050
billion dollars and the same goes for

132
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,700
Europe all right so I can probably guess

133
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,470
what you're now thinking I mean so what

134
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,820
I mean what exactly is the problem if

135
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,770
China wants to invest in other countries

136
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,330
well the problem is that many of those

137
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,789
investments might be a strategy to steal

138
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,400
technology from Europe and America and

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm really not making this up if you

140
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,720
want an example here it is you probably

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,850
know Oreo cookies well that sweet cream

142
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,350
they have in the middle is so pearly

143
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,430
white because they use a special

144
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,740
chemical component it's something based

145
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,380
on titanium dioxide that requires rocket

146
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,510
science in order to produce the pattern

147
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,220
to produce this belongs to a company

148
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,039
called DuPont sands it's a secret about

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,139
it as coca-cola is about their formula

150
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,900
so one day a Chinese spy Walter knew he

151
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,980
stole this formula

152
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,500
[Music]

153
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,810
years later at Chinese factory was mass

154
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,660
producing this white tints and this is

155
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,460
just one example of course in the Oreo

156
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,770
case that patent holders good accent

157
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,110
filed a lawsuit against the spies but

158
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,730
what would happen if instead of being a

159
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,860
spy this Walter Luo guy had been the

160
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,780
main shareholder of the Company in this

161
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,160
case he would have had access to the

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,470
company's secrets without any problems

163
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,000
and in all you're thinking well who

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,730
cares about cookies well cookies you're

165
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,440
right they're not important but what if

166
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,240
instead of white cream we were talking

167
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,910
about military technology then we can

168
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,500
have a bit of a problem and believe me

169
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,630
China will love to get military secrets

170
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,090
from European and American companies and

171
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,740
you might be wondering is this as bad as

172
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,570
some politicians and making it out to be

173
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,330
or is this just another chapter in the

174
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,580
ongoing trade war with China well today

175
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,690
we're going to answer all of these

176
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,820
questions but before we do let's take a

177
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,240
look back at the history more money and

178
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,550
even more deals when it comes to

179
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,080
investing in technology Americans

180
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,510
already have a huge funding market on to

181
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,430
create a start up just in California

182
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,230
you're going to find loads of VC firms

183
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,510
competing to make you the best deal the

184
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,970
European Union however is more of virgin

185
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,010
territory and this is why the European

186
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,750
Union became the favorite destination

187
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,400
for Chinese investors according to

188
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,110
several studies published by the market

189
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,000
or Institute for Chinese studies that

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,120
foreign direct investments or FDI in the

191
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,229
EU totaled more than 35 billion euros in

192
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,710
2016 with a 77 percent increase from the

193
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,660
previous year and Germany they were the

194
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,060
largest recipient accounting for 31% of

195
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,080
all of that money

196
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,310
Chinese investment in Europe is

197
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,830
increasing the region accounted for a

198
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,490
core of China's FBI outflows in 2017

199
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,470
Chinese investors have always showed a

200
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,569
strong predilection for tech and

201
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:59,759
advanced manufacturing assets some of

202
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,470
the big deals made where the acquisition

203
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,389
of a German robotics company for 4.4

204
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,030
billion euros and the 6.7 billion Europe

205
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,190
acquisition of the finished gaming firm

206
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,930
supercell and those are just the bigger

207
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,379
ones

208
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,229
just think about what 35 billion euros

209
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,550
can really do in the last couple of

210
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,919
years China again refocusing on the big

211
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,800
three European economies Germany the UK

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,750
and France those three together

213
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,180
accounted for 59 percent of their total

214
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,129
investments and look I know right now

215
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,289
I'm throwing a lot of numbers your way

216
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,909
but it's very important in order to

217
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,949
understand the magnitude of this

218
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,200
phenomena one day if you're bored you

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,450
can go check out China investment

220
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,370
tracker this is a database launched in

221
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,409
order to track and cover China's global

222
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,209
investment the database tracks China's

223
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,120
global outbound investments since 2005

224
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,770
and it's now hosted by the American

225
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,170
Enterprise Institute the data set is

226
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,880
publicly available and also includes

227
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,190
construction contracts and transactions

228
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,589
that were never completed is buying its

229
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,750
way into Europe bloomberg got to work

230
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,160
and providing us with some pretty

231
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,500
intense numbers just in the past 10

232
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,750
years China has bought or invested in

233
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,329
assets amounting to at least 318 billion

234
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:12,779
dollars

235
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,760
most of this money went to businesses

236
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,190
but some also went to infrastructure

237
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,870
just in the City of London Chinese

238
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,850
investors purchased a dozen office

239
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,770
towers knowing who is buying all of

240
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,450
these businesses and buildings in Europe

241
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,980
is important in order to try and

242
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,540
understand how this kind of activity

243
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,790
fits into China's foreign policy

244
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,620
giving in mind that the line between

245
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,080
state and private is pretty blurry in

246
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,450
China it's worth noting that at least 63

247
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,580
percent of the total investments come

248
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,440
from state backed companies or

249
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,090
investment funds in other words it is

250
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,190
China's government's that is investing

251
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,050
in technological firm now the question

252
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,050
comes - why is this all about making

253
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,390
money or maybe there's something more

254
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,530
here well that's what we're going to

255
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,100
look into right now

256
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,200
don't touch my tech even though Silicon

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,670
Valley it comes to mind whenever someone

258
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,730
talks about tech we shouldn't overlook

259
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,140
European tech giant's Spotify for

260
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,880
example is the most valuable streaming

261
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,920
service on the planet the company has

262
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,290
been valued as around 16 billion dollars

263
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,210
and where to Spotify come from well that

264
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,670
would be Sweden but we're not here to

265
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,590
talk about civil technology we're here

266
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,780
to talk about military technology and

267
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,680
here Arabs got a lot to offer

268
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,019
for example one of the biggest weapon

269
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,149
manufacturers in the world is the Airbus

270
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,980
group the corporation has headquarters

271
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,839
in France and the Netherlands they

272
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,269
design manufacture and sell civil and

273
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,329
military aerospace products worldwide in

274
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,420
2017 had a reported revenue of 67

275
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,490
billion euros military tech is a very

276
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,649
sensitive strategic topic and it's

277
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,050
usually kept very well-hidden but if you

278
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,819
invest in a company you can access their

279
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,009
databases and their secrets at the end

280
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,110
of the day you're one of the owners and

281
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,689
this is exactly what happens to humma

282
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:03,249
plumbers are these armored cars that you

283
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:09,490
see on the screen now the American army

284
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,709
has been using them for decades in the

285
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,689
year 2008 the company who manufactured

286
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,490
them the subsidiary of General Motors

287
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,160
was at the edge of collapse and this is

288
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,899
when a Chinese company they came to the

289
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:20,319
rescue

290
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,509
in their first negotiations they asked

291
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:23,949
for a couple of years so they could

292
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,110
examine the cars I mean that would be

293
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,699
pretty normal I mean you don't invest

294
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,199
half a billion dollars in a company

295
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,389
without knowing exactly what they do so

296
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,819
how I gave them those cars then the

297
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,649
White House with Obama as president

298
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,319
vetoed the Chinese acquisition why well

299
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:39,759
they simply didn't want to sell a

300
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,079
military company to another country

301
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,279
nevertheless those Chinese investors

302
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,139
already got and what they want it they

303
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,300
had the cars so well what did they do

304
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,579
with them well they reverse engineered

305
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,230
them they basically took all of the

306
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,179
pieces apart and learned how to build

307
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,429
their own Hummers from scratch since

308
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:59,529
then these are the Chinese Army's

309
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,130
brand-new armored cars

310
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,529
yep they look almost exactly the same as

311
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,230
the American hummus and this is just one

312
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,110
example there are many many more so in

313
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,819
Europe well they learn the lesson and

314
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,130
there determines not to repeat the same

315
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,950
mistakes

316
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,890
[Music]

317
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,320
is Europe finally pushing back on

318
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,910
Chinese investments and that's why

319
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,680
Europe's three major powers Germany

320
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,690
France and the UK have all recently

321
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,790
taken steps to closely scrutinize

322
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,530
Chinese investments and they have

323
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,840
reasons to be afraid for example Germany

324
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,240
produces some state-of-the-art tanks the

325
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,820
so called lapid's well according to many

326
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,530
experts the new Chinese tanks have

327
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,960
identical motors this is why Germany

328
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,880
recently vetoed the Chinese attempt to

329
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,040
invest two billion dollars in robotics

330
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,780
in their country citing national

331
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,630
security concerns

332
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,740
[Music]

333
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,450
the government is also working on a

334
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,590
proposal that would strengthen

335
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,480
governments all vetting of acquisitions

336
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,980
by foreigners and the same is happening

337
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,900
in France French lawmakers passed

338
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,600
legislation as early as 2003 that also

339
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,550
allows the government to scrutinize and

340
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,710
veto foreign investments since then they

341
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,030
have added more regulations for

342
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,130
companies in the Big Data artificial

343
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,600
intelligence and robotics industries

344
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,580
France is open to long-term investment

345
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,920
from China but not looting French

346
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,320
finance minister Bruno Lima II as you

347
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,270
know anytime France and Germany agree on

348
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,830
something it's just a matter of time

349
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,750
before the European Union follows suit

350
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,209
the agreed package will ensure that the

351
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:37,399
EU and its member states are equipped to

352
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,290
protect their quote essential interests

353
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,329
while remaining quote one of the most

354
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,670
open investment regimes end quote in the

355
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,319
world and this is where the complicated

356
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:46,670
part starts because the line that

357
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,129
separates those essential interests and

358
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,430
they're not so special is extremely

359
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,170
blurry you see we can all agree that a

360
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,939
company that manufactures tanks is a

361
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:58,430
weapon manufacturer and that we want to

362
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,589
protect it there's no debate about that

363
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,470
but what happens with the company that

364
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,389
produces the microchip that controls the

365
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:07,579
computers on board the tank I mean that

366
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,139
might be a company that works with a lot

367
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,060
of people not just ones with military

368
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,920
interests in fact a bus itself has a

369
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,300
Civil Division and they produce

370
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,160
commercial airliners

371
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,350
question comes around too well should we

372
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,000
protect that as well in other words

373
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,070
those essential interests can become a

374
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,990
Trojan horse for all kinds of

375
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,660
protectionist and arguably financially

376
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,120
xenophobic measures and believe me the

377
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,120
risk on this matter is also very real

378
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,370
Emmanuel macron promises to stop foreign

379
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,710
investors buying up French farms after

380
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,140
China land grab yep you heard that right

381
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,450
how on earth is farming related to the

382
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,210
military it's pretty hard to understand

383
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,460
right but the truth is French farmers

384
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,040
don't like the Chinese a macron well

385
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,140
he's got elections to win in the future

386
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,300
and the same goes for the United Kingdom

387
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,520
for example in the year 2016 the British

388
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,470
government vetoed a Chinese investment

389
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,090
in the nuclear power plant was that a

390
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,980
strategic decision or was it just

391
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,350
straightforward protectionism well it's

392
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,200
pretty hard to tell

393
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,669
[Music]

394
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:17,649
and I know I know I many of you might be

395
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,049
thinking right now in the Chinese right

396
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,619
well the truth is we need money remember

397
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,209
that story about Hummer well guess what

398
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:26,559
happened right after the White House

399
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:33,330
vetoed that Chinese acquisition

400
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,190
General Motors too close Hummer after

401
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,890
sale fails from one day to the next

402
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,010
almost 3,000 people lost their jobs and

403
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,080
what about those 35 billion euros for

404
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,790
European startups on a previous visual

405
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,260
politic video we've told you the story

406
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,840
behind Silicon Valley and how Europe was

407
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,880
able to attract venture capital funds

408
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,930
it's a fact

409
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,610
Brussels Berlin and Paris are going

410
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,410
crazy trying to find on trap and nerves

411
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,780
Europe wants to lead the so-called

412
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,270
fourth Industrial Revolution but you

413
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,520
don't do that with grants and subsidies

414
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,130
alone you need venture capitalists and

415
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,070
private investors of all kinds and a big

416
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,050
share of this money it's coming from

417
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,760
China in fact you remember mom Hong Zhu

418
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,100
the hallway vice-president well don't

419
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,660
forget that just in Europe alone more

420
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,850
than 11,000 people are working for this

421
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,460
company so now the question comes to you

422
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,260
which is more important economic growth

423
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,110
and innovation on national security is

424
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,060
there a way to protect both things at

425
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,620
the same time well please leave your

called dark web monitoring which

443
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,600

444
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,040
