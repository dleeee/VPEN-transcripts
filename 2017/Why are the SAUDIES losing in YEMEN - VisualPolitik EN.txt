2
00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.710
many of you probably think all the

3
00:00:08.79 --> 00:00:13.139
countries in the Arabian Peninsula are

4
00:00:10.71 --> 00:00:14.490
insanely wealthy right I mean this is

5
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.230
the region of the world where Qatar

6
00:00:14.49 --> 00:00:18.270
Dubai and the rest of the oil monarchies

7
00:00:16.23 --> 00:00:19.590
are after all nonetheless right in this

8
00:00:18.27 --> 00:00:22.109
region of the planet is a country that

9
00:00:19.59 --> 00:00:24.630
is extremely poor the place with a GDP

10
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.150
per capita lower than that of Tanzania

11
00:00:24.63 --> 00:00:28.830
or Senegal the name of this country is

12
00:00:27.15 --> 00:00:33.330
Yemen and it is currently going through

13
00:00:28.83 --> 00:00:36.449
a civil war that has lasted 42 years

14
00:00:33.33 --> 00:00:38.969
[Music]

15
00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.039
and look this this it's no small war in

16
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.719
fact the war in Yemen is the Arabian

17
00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.030
equivalent to the war in Vietnam

18
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.949
here we find two of the biggest powers

19
00:00:45.03 --> 00:00:49.350
in the Muslim world supporting different

20
00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.879
sides of the conflict on the one hand we

21
00:00:49.35 --> 00:00:52.949
have the Yemeni government supported by

22
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.260
Saudi Arabia and all their allies

23
00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.539
including the United States and on the

24
00:00:55.26 --> 00:00:59.909
other side there are the revolutionaries

25
00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.670
backed by Iran and between these two

26
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:07.460
sides there is the Yemeni branch of - or

27
00:01:02.67 --> 00:01:07.460
these so-called Ansar al-sharia movement

28
00:01:07.97 --> 00:01:11.819
now if you've been subscribed to visual

29
00:01:10.44 --> 00:01:13.830
politic for a while you already know

30
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.440
that Saudi Arabia has the third best

31
00:01:13.83 --> 00:01:18.149
equipped army in the entire world thus

32
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:20.369
they have the support of American drones

33
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.799
and the armies of neighbouring countries

34
00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.869
they have more than 180 state-of-the-art

35
00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.970
combat jets and three hundred thousand

36
00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.619
soldiers armed with the best weapons on

37
00:01:26.97 --> 00:01:30.539
the other side they have less than half

38
00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.640
that number of soldiers and the weapons

39
00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.640
they are armed with are far from modern

40
00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.319
now so this seems like a pretty unequal

41
00:01:38.28 --> 00:01:42.390
fight right well in that case it might

42
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:48.359
surprise you to learn that Saudi Arabia

43
00:01:42.39 --> 00:01:50.250
is losing this war Saudi Arabia says

44
00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.109
prepared for ceasefire in Yemen if

45
00:01:50.25 --> 00:01:54.810
Houthis agree and so now you might

46
00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.700
wonder how exactly is this possible how

47
00:01:54.81 --> 00:01:59.159
is it possible to explain why one of the

48
00:01:56.7 --> 00:02:01.289
most advanced armies in the world can't

49
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.369
beat a bunch of guerrillas well today

50
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.990
we're visual politic while we're gonna

51
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.420
answer that question but before we get

52
00:02:03.99 --> 00:02:09.170
into any of that let's have a look at

53
00:02:06.42 --> 00:02:09.170
the history

54
00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.840
who is who Yemen the first thing we need

55
00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.090
to understand is that this is not the

56
00:02:15.84 --> 00:02:20.970
first time Yemen has had a civil war in

57
00:02:18.09 --> 00:02:23.459
fact this is the third one in just 25

58
00:02:20.97 --> 00:02:26.220
years Yemen is a country divided by both

59
00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.709
ideology as well as religion indeed

60
00:02:26.22 --> 00:02:31.600
before the 1990s Yemen was split into

61
00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.130
two different countries

62
00:02:31.6 --> 00:02:36.680
[Music]

63
00:02:34.13 --> 00:02:38.480
we had South Yemen with a communist

64
00:02:36.68 --> 00:02:41.330
governments and then there was North

65
00:02:38.48 --> 00:02:43.250
Yemen who had a pro Saudi government and

66
00:02:41.33 --> 00:02:45.890
the guy you are seeing on the screen now

67
00:02:43.25 --> 00:02:48.020
Ali Abdullah Saleh who was the president

68
00:02:45.89 --> 00:02:50.420
of the north started ruling over the

69
00:02:48.02 --> 00:02:53.020
entire country from its capital the city

70
00:02:50.42 --> 00:02:53.020
of Sanaa

71
00:02:53.68 --> 00:02:57.250
[Music]

72
00:02:54.91 --> 00:02:59.650
as you can imagine Salah is one of those

73
00:02:57.25 --> 00:03:02.410
politicians who considers democracy and

74
00:02:59.65 --> 00:03:04.510
human rights to be well pretty optional

75
00:03:02.41 --> 00:03:06.370
four years into his new country's

76
00:03:04.51 --> 00:03:08.560
history and the former southern

77
00:03:06.37 --> 00:03:10.900
communist leaders started an uprising

78
00:03:08.56 --> 00:03:13.000
against the less governments this war

79
00:03:10.9 --> 00:03:14.950
only lasted a few months and the new

80
00:03:13.0 --> 00:03:18.130
government won with the assistance of

81
00:03:14.95 --> 00:03:20.170
the Saudis a decade later in 2004 Yemen

82
00:03:18.13 --> 00:03:22.510
had further anti-government turmoil this

83
00:03:20.17 --> 00:03:24.490
time the opposition was a rebel group of

84
00:03:22.51 --> 00:03:26.440
Shia Muslims remember their name because

85
00:03:24.49 --> 00:03:28.090
they are important for the war that's

86
00:03:26.44 --> 00:03:30.400
going on today they are called the

87
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:33.270
Houthi rebels but again these Salah

88
00:03:30.4 --> 00:03:34.959
governments beat down this uprising

89
00:03:33.27 --> 00:03:38.079
[Music]

90
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.909
in 2011 with the Arab Spring in full

91
00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.400
swing the citizens rebelled against

92
00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.590
sulla again but this time Scylla left

93
00:03:42.4 --> 00:03:46.750
power with his Prime Minister mansur

94
00:03:44.59 --> 00:03:48.549
al-hadi this new president found himself

95
00:03:46.75 --> 00:03:50.650
in control of a terribly weak

96
00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.239
government's further al-qaeda were

97
00:03:50.65 --> 00:03:54.010
working on destroying the country and

98
00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.930
during all of this well the protesters

99
00:03:54.01 --> 00:03:57.519
they kept protesting now do you remember

100
00:03:55.93 --> 00:03:59.560
those who theme rebels that we talked

101
00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.420
about just a moment ago well they came

102
00:03:59.56 --> 00:04:04.000
back but this time they were more

103
00:04:01.42 --> 00:04:06.940
powerful and had a lot of support and

104
00:04:04.0 --> 00:04:09.250
this explains why in 2014 they managed

105
00:04:06.94 --> 00:04:11.540
to take over the government

106
00:04:09.25 --> 00:04:13.519
[Music]

107
00:04:11.54 --> 00:04:16.669
okay so now you might be wondering what

108
00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.620
did al-hadi do well he left capital and

109
00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.630
moved to the city of Arden in the south

110
00:04:18.62 --> 00:04:22.660
of the country to start a provisional

111
00:04:20.63 --> 00:04:22.660
government

112
00:04:22.76 --> 00:04:28.550
[Music]

113
00:04:25.75 --> 00:04:31.220
now remember here that Saudi Arabia is a

114
00:04:28.55 --> 00:04:32.990
Sunni Muslim country band well who is

115
00:04:31.22 --> 00:04:35.030
the biggest enemy of Sunni Muslims oh

116
00:04:32.99 --> 00:04:36.979
yeah that would be these Shia Muslims

117
00:04:35.03 --> 00:04:39.349
these are exactly the people who have

118
00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.330
conquered the capital of Yemen and this

119
00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.400
explains why the Saudis are so keen on

120
00:04:41.33 --> 00:04:45.919
supporting al Hardy and his provisional

121
00:04:43.4 --> 00:04:48.560
government in Aden then finally we also

122
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.080
have - aka Islamic state in the mix as

123
00:04:48.56 --> 00:04:52.940
well who are well an enemy of both sides

124
00:04:51.08 --> 00:04:54.770
all right so now we have the Houthi

125
00:04:52.94 --> 00:04:57.050
rebels and their supporters the Houthis

126
00:04:54.77 --> 00:04:59.120
are Shia Muslims and therefore they are

127
00:04:57.05 --> 00:05:01.220
friends with Iran on the other hand

128
00:04:59.12 --> 00:05:03.470
al-hadi he is in Arlen and he is

129
00:05:01.22 --> 00:05:05.810
supported by the Saudis and the Saudis

130
00:05:03.47 --> 00:05:08.930
will do whatever it takes to ensure that

131
00:05:05.81 --> 00:05:10.340
Iranian influence in Yemen is minimized

132
00:05:08.93 --> 00:05:12.470
you probably remember from one of our

133
00:05:10.34 --> 00:05:15.650
previous videos that Saudi Arabia and

134
00:05:12.47 --> 00:05:19.840
Iran are diehard enemies and thus in

135
00:05:15.65 --> 00:05:24.960
2015 another Yemeni civil war started

136
00:05:19.84 --> 00:05:24.960
[Music]

137
00:05:27.23 --> 00:05:36.410
a natural fortress when we think about

138
00:05:33.77 --> 00:05:39.620
Saudi Arabia we think of a big desert

139
00:05:36.41 --> 00:05:41.900
with clean sand and dunes Yemen it's

140
00:05:39.62 --> 00:05:43.820
rather different it is a country full of

141
00:05:41.9 --> 00:05:45.830
mountains almost as high as the Rockies

142
00:05:43.82 --> 00:05:48.800
in the United States some peaks are

143
00:05:45.83 --> 00:05:51.770
higher than 3600 meters

144
00:05:48.8 --> 00:05:53.660
[Music]

145
00:05:51.77 --> 00:05:55.970
all of this makes it really hard to

146
00:05:53.66 --> 00:05:57.770
transport a big army no matter how

147
00:05:55.97 --> 00:05:59.930
well-equipped atures for instance the

148
00:05:57.77 --> 00:06:03.110
Saudis they utilize a tank model called

149
00:05:59.93 --> 00:06:05.900
the m1a1 Abrams this is sort of like the

150
00:06:03.11 --> 00:06:08.060
BMW of tanks now imagine a convoy of

151
00:06:05.9 --> 00:06:12.890
these machines crossing a path where

152
00:06:08.06 --> 00:06:14.360
they have to travel in single file you

153
00:06:12.89 --> 00:06:16.790
would just need a few guerrilla warriors

154
00:06:14.36 --> 00:06:20.210
with an RPG seven rocket launcher to

155
00:06:16.79 --> 00:06:21.860
destroy an entire battalion the RPG 7 is

156
00:06:20.21 --> 00:06:24.050
a rocket launcher that you can see on

157
00:06:21.86 --> 00:06:25.490
video games such as call of duty and it

158
00:06:24.05 --> 00:06:27.830
has a market price of around three

159
00:06:25.49 --> 00:06:29.870
thousand US dollars the m1 Abrams tank

160
00:06:27.83 --> 00:06:32.270
on the other hand costs around six

161
00:06:29.87 --> 00:06:35.430
million dollars

162
00:06:32.27 --> 00:06:35.430
[Music]

163
00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.740
but well not only that as we said at the

164
00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:45.009
start of this video the Saudi Coalition

165
00:06:41.74 --> 00:06:48.249
has over 180 combat jets and also

166
00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:49.869
American drones but there is a further

167
00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:52.330
problem here in the landscape full of

168
00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:54.520
mountains and caves it really is easy to

169
00:06:52.33 --> 00:06:56.649
hide from these drones not even the

170
00:06:54.52 --> 00:07:04.869
state-of-the-art radars can see in

171
00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:06.580
detail what's inside of the caves and of

172
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:08.169
course the Houthi warriors they know the

173
00:07:06.58 --> 00:07:10.179
battlefield like the back of their hands

174
00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.919
and they know where all the good hiding

175
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:13.509
places are in many cases they can travel

176
00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:15.639
from one village to another without

177
00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:18.069
being exposed to any of the drone radars

178
00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:20.589
they can also hide their weapons inside

179
00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.999
these caves but that is still not all

180
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:24.490
even though these guerrillas that have

181
00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:27.279
no Hummers or other modern vehicles they

182
00:07:24.49 --> 00:07:29.110
have something better they have animals

183
00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:31.449
oh yes you heard that right

184
00:07:29.11 --> 00:07:33.879
in those high mountain areas the most

185
00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:36.490
effective way to transport something is

186
00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:39.539
by using donkeys or camels

187
00:07:36.49 --> 00:07:41.529
[Music]

188
00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:42.639
so in other words the only way of

189
00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:44.349
tracking the movements of these

190
00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.729
guerrilla warriors is by having people

191
00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.229
behind their lines

192
00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:49.509
now we're not exactly talking

193
00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:51.579
double-oh-seven like spies here that

194
00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.559
rather local citizens who are willing to

195
00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:54.159
help or soldiers who are close to enemy

196
00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:56.319
lines

197
00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:58.449
all right so even with these problems

198
00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.699
you might still be wondering how the

199
00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:02.799
Saudis are getting beaten the scales

200
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:12.669
seem to still be tips pretty far in

201
00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:14.529
Saudi Arabia's favor aid to motivated

202
00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:16.149
army now many of you might think that

203
00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:17.829
the political system of the country has

204
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:21.689
nothing to do with the way they

205
00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:24.069
organized their army and conduct war

206
00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:26.829
well actually in a country like Saudi

207
00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:28.299
Arabia they are really connected in an

208
00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:30.549
absolute monarchy like they have in

209
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:32.860
Saudi Arabia the royal house cannot

210
00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:35.139
trust their army their main obsession is

211
00:08:32.86 --> 00:08:37.240
keeping control over the entire military

212
00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:39.490
from the top all the way to the bottom

213
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:43.469
this is why the decision-making power is

214
00:08:39.49 --> 00:08:43.469
slower than in any other army

215
00:08:47.84 --> 00:08:50.390
let's have a look at a hypothetical

216
00:08:49.13 --> 00:08:52.040
example here because it's all

217
00:08:50.39 --> 00:08:54.050
illustrative asset let's imagine a

218
00:08:52.04 --> 00:08:56.540
soldier discovers a machine-gun nest

219
00:08:54.05 --> 00:08:57.920
that is say 300 meters out in western

220
00:08:56.54 --> 00:09:00.230
armies such as the American or British

221
00:08:57.92 --> 00:09:02.420
one that soldier can easily ask for

222
00:09:00.23 --> 00:09:04.190
reinforcements by radio usually he or

223
00:09:02.42 --> 00:09:05.839
she would go alongside with another

224
00:09:04.19 --> 00:09:07.940
soldier from the Air Force who can give

225
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:10.160
the exact coordinates to a pilot nearby

226
00:09:07.94 --> 00:09:12.500
in a matter of minutes a combat jet is

227
00:09:10.16 --> 00:09:14.690
bombing the machine-gun nest now let's

228
00:09:12.5 --> 00:09:16.010
consider the Saudi army first of all our

229
00:09:14.69 --> 00:09:17.330
soldier would have to tell the sergeant

230
00:09:16.01 --> 00:09:18.890
and that sergeant would have to speak to

231
00:09:17.33 --> 00:09:20.450
someone higher up and but the time that

232
00:09:18.89 --> 00:09:22.130
decision has really reached someone he

233
00:09:20.45 --> 00:09:24.770
can actually make the decision it's been

234
00:09:22.13 --> 00:09:26.839
longer than an hour for 60 minutes here

235
00:09:24.77 --> 00:09:31.660
are the difference between neutralizing

236
00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:31.660
an enemy position and losing a soldier

237
00:09:31.8 --> 00:09:36.000
[Music]

238
00:09:33.87 --> 00:09:38.310
and the same goes for military training

239
00:09:36.0 --> 00:09:40.260
most Saudi officials come from the royal

240
00:09:38.31 --> 00:09:45.930
houses and they didn't go through any

241
00:09:40.26 --> 00:09:47.790
sort of academic military training they

242
00:09:45.93 --> 00:09:50.280
got their position due to pure nepotism

243
00:09:47.79 --> 00:09:52.500
and this means well a distinct lack of

244
00:09:50.28 --> 00:09:54.360
knowledge and skills the same goes for

245
00:09:52.5 --> 00:09:55.980
normal soldiers as well as you probably

246
00:09:54.36 --> 00:09:57.960
know in most of these oil monarchies

247
00:09:55.98 --> 00:10:00.390
most of the native citizens work as

248
00:09:57.96 --> 00:10:02.040
civil servants with sky-high salaries

249
00:10:00.39 --> 00:10:07.050
they really don't know anything about

250
00:10:02.04 --> 00:10:08.790
discipline or hard work so let's look at

251
00:10:07.05 --> 00:10:10.140
an example in the video here you can see

252
00:10:08.79 --> 00:10:13.460
that they don't even know how to protect

253
00:10:10.14 --> 00:10:13.460
a tank with infantry

254
00:10:17.63 --> 00:10:21.140
[Music]

255
00:10:19.16 --> 00:10:22.700
and don't forget that inside that tank

256
00:10:21.14 --> 00:10:25.100
it's very difficult to see the outside

257
00:10:22.7 --> 00:10:26.780
this is why a basic principle of war is

258
00:10:25.1 --> 00:10:29.030
that you always want to have soldiers

259
00:10:26.78 --> 00:10:31.040
walking around the tank so that they can

260
00:10:29.03 --> 00:10:34.430
see if something is firing upon it

261
00:10:31.04 --> 00:10:35.990
this really is war 101 nevertheless the

262
00:10:34.43 --> 00:10:38.150
Saudis missed that class and this

263
00:10:35.99 --> 00:10:42.160
explains why it is so easy to destroy

264
00:10:38.15 --> 00:10:42.160
their tanks with such cheap weaponry

265
00:10:44.81 --> 00:10:48.470
this is have a look at this other video

266
00:10:46.43 --> 00:10:51.080
here you can see how someone gets close

267
00:10:48.47 --> 00:10:53.970
enough to you a tank to put a bomb on it

268
00:10:51.08 --> 00:10:55.829
[Music]

269
00:10:53.97 --> 00:10:57.989
on the other hand surprisingly the

270
00:10:55.829 --> 00:11:00.389
Houthi rebels have a much more Western

271
00:10:57.989 --> 00:11:02.339
management system small groups can react

272
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:08.879
quickly and they don't need to go all

273
00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:10.319
the way up through the hierarchy thus

274
00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:11.429
their motivation is way higher because

275
00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:14.069
they don't have the option of just

276
00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:16.049
retiring arguably they are defending

277
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:17.999
their home from a foreign army in

278
00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:19.979
summary the war on Yemen is a really

279
00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:22.529
excellent example of how strategy is

280
00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:24.869
more important than weaponry and that an

281
00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:27.889
authoritarian system makes for a less

282
00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:27.889
efficient army

283
00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.819
sadly the fact that the Saudis are

284
00:11:30.869 --> 00:11:35.099
losing this war doesn't mean they're not

285
00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:39.899
killing people in fact the opposite is

286
00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:41.879
true death toll in Yemen conflict passes

287
00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.709
10,000 unfortunately what could have

288
00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:45.479
been solved in a peaceful democratic way

289
00:11:43.709 --> 00:11:47.369
has become a war of attrition that will

290
00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:49.109
leave a footprint on this country for

291
00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:51.449
generations to come and now the question

292
00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:52.979
is do you think the Saudis can turn on

293
00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:54.869
the table on this conflict or are we

294
00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:57.029
going to see this conflict last for a

295
00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:58.889
