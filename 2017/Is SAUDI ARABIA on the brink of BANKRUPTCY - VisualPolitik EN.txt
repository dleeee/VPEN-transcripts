00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:13.080
in June of 2014 a single barrel of oil

2
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:15.630
cost one hundred and fourteen dollars

3
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:17.279
today the price is just fifty dollars

4
00:00:15.63 --> 00:00:19.199
this drop is far beyond the usual

5
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.180
fluctuations of the price of this raw

6
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.100
material and beyond the predictions of

7
00:00:21.18 --> 00:00:24.990
pessimistic defenders of the Peak Oil

8
00:00:23.1 --> 00:00:26.460
Theory these theories that we are about

9
00:00:24.99 --> 00:00:29.250
to have a severe shortage because

10
00:00:26.46 --> 00:00:31.470
petroleum is always running out more

11
00:00:29.25 --> 00:00:33.690
slowly good producer but making long

12
00:00:31.47 --> 00:00:35.100
tires and ligands of its kind the truth

13
00:00:33.69 --> 00:00:36.510
is that there are many different factors

14
00:00:35.1 --> 00:00:38.910
that suggest that the price of petroleum

15
00:00:36.51 --> 00:00:41.280
is going to remain low for quite some

16
00:00:38.91 --> 00:00:44.399
time this is mainly due to two reasons

17
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:46.559
the first is the constant improvement of

18
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.079
energy efficiency meaning that we have a

19
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.850
lesser need for energy this is logical

20
00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.800
when you think of the group of ofed

21
00:00:50.85 --> 00:00:54.840
countries that's the world's wealthiest

22
00:00:52.8 --> 00:00:56.910
countries are using the same amount of

23
00:00:54.84 --> 00:01:00.840
primary energy as they used in the year

24
00:00:56.91 --> 00:01:03.390
2000 but they are producing 30% more the

25
00:01:00.84 --> 00:01:05.280
u.s. is the biggest market with 40,000

26
00:01:03.39 --> 00:01:07.110
plug-in cars purchased there in the

27
00:01:05.28 --> 00:01:08.760
first six months of this year a second

28
00:01:07.11 --> 00:01:11.310
reason is innovation and technological

29
00:01:08.76 --> 00:01:13.830
development a field of expertise that is

30
00:01:11.31 --> 00:01:15.479
inherent to human evolution this is a

31
00:01:13.83 --> 00:01:17.880
development that has occurred on two

32
00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.340
fronts both fossil fuels as well as

33
00:01:17.88 --> 00:01:22.860
renewable energies the best example of

34
00:01:20.34 --> 00:01:24.420
this might be fracking this is a

35
00:01:22.86 --> 00:01:26.640
technology that has provided the world

36
00:01:24.42 --> 00:01:28.290
with a large amount of oil as well as a

37
00:01:26.64 --> 00:01:30.869
natural gas in fact this technology

38
00:01:28.29 --> 00:01:32.460
alone has led to the u.s. doubling its

39
00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.350
oil production and currently that

40
00:01:32.46 --> 00:01:37.110
country is producing more oil than it

41
00:01:34.35 --> 00:01:39.329
has since in 1970 now on the other hand

42
00:01:37.11 --> 00:01:41.490
the ecological impacts of fracking is a

43
00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.659
highly controversial topic that's that's

44
00:01:41.49 --> 00:01:43.229
something we're going to address in a

45
00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.119
later video

46
00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.040
now the reduced price of oil has been an

47
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.890
incredible setback for Persian Gulf

48
00:01:47.04 --> 00:01:51.240
countries where 85% of their revenue

49
00:01:49.89 --> 00:01:53.330
relies on this resort

[Music]

51
00:01:53.33 --> 00:01:59.040
after until now this has allowed for the

52
00:01:56.19 --> 00:02:01.050
payment of all kinds of bills citizens

53
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:03.210
have got use to high levels of subsidies

54
00:02:01.05 --> 00:02:05.250
and allowances while also getting used

55
00:02:03.21 --> 00:02:07.440
to not having to pay any taxes oil has

56
00:02:05.25 --> 00:02:10.229
subsidized everything water electricity

57
00:02:07.44 --> 00:02:12.239
fuel low-interest loans and citizens

58
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.340
have also got used to the idea that they

59
00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.190
have a right to a well-paid civil

60

service job

[Music]

62
00:02:19.29 --> 00:02:22.830
furthermore countries in the Persian

63
00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.829
Gulf have got used to spending an

64
00:02:22.83 --> 00:02:27.030
enormous amount of money on gun in fact

65
00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.400
they have spent so much money on

66
00:02:27.03 --> 00:02:32.370
weaponry that Saudi Arabia now spends

67
00:02:29.4 --> 00:02:34.140
more on its military than Russia this

68
00:02:32.37 --> 00:02:37.330
makes it the country with the third

69
00:02:34.14 --> 00:02:42.380
largest military budget globally

70
00:02:37.33 --> 00:02:44.390

71
00:02:42.38 --> 00:02:46.160
so that we all know the oil money has

72
00:02:44.39 --> 00:02:47.090
paid for Pro Atlantic campaigns all

73
00:02:46.16 --> 00:02:49.460
around the world

74
00:02:47.09 --> 00:02:51.710
however these pre-existing policies have

75
00:02:49.46 --> 00:02:53.840
become completely unsustainable due to

76
00:02:51.71 --> 00:02:56.990
the drop in the price of oil in fact in

77
00:02:53.84 --> 00:03:00.020
2015 alone oil-producing countries lost

78
00:02:56.99 --> 00:03:05.360
three hundred and sixty billion dollars

79
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:07.430
in oil revenue and this is all because

80
00:03:05.36 --> 00:03:09.650
of the harder' drop in the price of oil

81
00:03:07.43 --> 00:03:11.900
now don't get me wrong they do still get

82
00:03:09.65 --> 00:03:14.060
an enormous amount of money from oil

83
00:03:11.9 --> 00:03:15.770
Saudi Arabia for example gets around

84
00:03:14.06 --> 00:03:18.470
five thousand five hundred dollars per

85
00:03:15.77 --> 00:03:20.330
capita from its black gold

86
00:03:18.47 --> 00:03:21.920
must-have despite this still significant

87
00:03:20.33 --> 00:03:24.200
amount of income they are unable to

88
00:03:21.92 --> 00:03:25.520
maintain all of the subsidies that they

89
00:03:24.2 --> 00:03:27.470
have established because of this

90
00:03:25.52 --> 00:03:29.480
changing scenario all countries in the

91
00:03:27.47 --> 00:03:32.210
Persian Gulf are announcing ambitious

92
00:03:29.48 --> 00:03:33.680
plans to diversify their economies this

93
00:03:32.21 --> 00:03:36.200
will allow them to get some distance

94
00:03:33.68 --> 00:03:38.150
from the economies completely relying on

95
00:03:36.2 --> 00:03:40.070
oil they are looking to follow Dubai as

96
00:03:38.15 --> 00:03:42.080
example which has been one of the only

97
00:03:40.07 --> 00:03:44.180
countries to successfully transition

98
00:03:42.08 --> 00:03:47.020
away from a totally oil-based economy in

101

because of this diversification away

00:03:55.08 --> 00:03:59.160
from oil the Emirates is becoming a

103
00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.910
world leader in terms of tourism trade

00:04:05.89 --> 00:04:10.330
tens of billions of dollars are being

106
00:04:08.17 --> 00:04:12.460
invested into Qatar with the hope that

107
00:04:10.33 --> 00:04:14.980
it will become an economy of knowledge

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.930
prestigious schools in the world can be

112
00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.730
found there are also notable researchers

113
00:04:22.93 --> 00:04:26.920
working there with budgets that seem

114
00:04:24.73 --> 00:04:28.870
almost infinite however the most

115
00:04:26.92 --> 00:04:30.820
archetypical case is the one we find in

116
00:04:28.87 --> 00:04:33.130
Saudi Arabia one of the world's most

117
00:04:30.82 --> 00:04:35.890
suffocating and terrifying countries

118
00:04:33.13 --> 00:04:38.140
human rights in Saudi Arabia are nothing

119
00:04:35.89 --> 00:04:39.940
more than an illusion women are forced

120
00:04:38.14 --> 00:04:42.520
to marry underage and they can't even

121
00:04:39.94 --> 00:04:44.710
drive further dozens of executions occur

122
00:04:42.52 --> 00:04:48.100
every year and torture is quite routine

123
00:04:44.71 --> 00:04:50.710
blasphemy homosexual acts treason and

124
00:04:48.1 --> 00:04:53.050
murder are punishable by death through

125
00:04:50.71 --> 00:04:54.760
beheading in Saudi Arabia and Islamic

126
00:04:53.05 --> 00:04:57.490
state further the country has even

127
00:04:54.76 --> 00:05:00.490
banned theaters and nightclubs in Saudi

128
00:04:57.49 --> 00:05:06.730
Arabia religion and fundamentalism are

129
00:05:00.49 --> 00:05:09.400
more important than anything else but

130
00:05:06.73 --> 00:05:12.010
the economic crisis cannot be escaped

131
00:05:09.4 --> 00:05:16.090
and today they are facing a very complex

132
00:05:12.01 --> 00:05:19.120
situation in 2015 the deficit was 15% of

133
00:05:16.09 --> 00:05:21.340
the GDP and this continued into 2016

134
00:05:19.12 --> 00:05:22.840
this is threatening to swallow up all of

135
00:05:21.34 --> 00:05:25.540
the money that they saved during the

136
00:05:22.84 --> 00:05:28.060
Black Gold year further unemployment is

137
00:05:25.54 --> 00:05:29.710
becoming a major concern and this is no

138
00:05:28.06 --> 00:05:31.210
more true than among young people

139
00:05:29.71 --> 00:05:33.490
the unemployment rate is currently

140
00:05:31.21 --> 00:05:36.850
sitting for young people at around 40%

141
00:05:33.49 --> 00:05:39.160
this is why in April 2016 Prince

142
00:05:36.85 --> 00:05:40.710
Mohammed Bill Salman the strongest man

143
00:05:39.16 --> 00:05:44.020
in the kingdom announced an ambitious

144
00:05:40.71 --> 00:05:46.750
reform plan known as Saudi vision 2030

145
00:05:44.02 --> 00:05:48.760
the goal of this reform plan is nothing

146
00:05:46.75 --> 00:05:50.919
less than to transform the country's

147
00:05:48.76 --> 00:05:53.800
economy completely say look this is a

148
00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.979
good plan we need to diversify away

149
00:05:53.8 --> 00:05:59.140
because of necessity otherwise the

150
00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.970
country will have far more difficulties

151
00:05:59.14 --> 00:06:03.580
in the years to come the plan aims to

152
00:06:00.97 --> 00:06:06.130
achieve total independence from oil by

153
00:06:03.58 --> 00:06:08.950
2020 and become one of the most globally

154
00:06:06.13 --> 00:06:10.930
competitive economies by 2030 the first

155
00:06:08.95 --> 00:06:13.120
step of this starts by privatizing

156
00:06:10.93 --> 00:06:15.250
Aramco this is one of the world's

157
00:06:13.12 --> 00:06:17.770
largest companies which controls 10

158
00:06:15.25 --> 00:06:18.910
percent of global oil production the

159
00:06:17.77 --> 00:06:21.640
company is estimated

160
00:06:18.91 --> 00:06:23.560
value is five times that of Apple with

161
00:06:21.64 --> 00:06:25.350
all the money from that privatization

162
00:06:23.56 --> 00:06:27.460
addition of foreign reserve other

163
00:06:25.35 --> 00:06:29.860
privatizations of public companies and

164
00:06:27.46 --> 00:06:32.110
it's real estate Saudi Arabia wants to

165
00:06:29.86 --> 00:06:35.280
generate a sovereign wealth fund of two

166
00:06:32.11 --> 00:06:35.280
trillion dollars

167
00:06:38.08 --> 00:06:41.770
this will allow them to get a more

168
00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.780
predictable and stable income than they

169
00:06:41.77 --> 00:06:45.430
are currently getting from oil they also

170
00:06:43.78 --> 00:06:46.870
want to eliminate many of the subsidies

171
00:06:45.43 --> 00:06:49.060
that are currently threatening their

172
00:06:46.87 --> 00:06:51.490
economy and investing new sectors like

173
00:06:49.06 --> 00:06:54.699
mining finance and importantly the

174
00:06:51.49 --> 00:06:56.229
military industry uber is getting a

175
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.659
three and a half billion dollar

176
00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:01.060
investment from Saudi Arabia's public

177
00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:02.680
investment fund new taxes are also going

178
00:07:01.06 --> 00:07:04.060
to be introduced as another method of

179
00:07:02.68 --> 00:07:05.319
earning for the government the prince

180
00:07:04.06 --> 00:07:07.240
also wants to change the higher

181
00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.490
educational system which is currently

182
00:07:07.24 --> 00:07:11.770
closer to the Quran and developers to

183
00:07:09.49 --> 00:07:15.069
meet modern market requirement but the

184
00:07:11.77 --> 00:07:18.400
big question has to be is Saudi Arabia

185
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.900
going to succeed it is no easy task for

186
00:07:18.4 --> 00:07:22.240
a country to quickly become an

187
00:07:19.9 --> 00:07:23.889
industrial power and it is unlikely the

188
00:07:22.24 --> 00:07:25.750
tourists are going to be drawn to a

189
00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.270
country which these people regularly

190
00:07:25.75 --> 00:07:30.699
stoned for homosexuality or adultery

191
00:07:28.27 --> 00:07:32.590
however all of that said Saudi Arabia's

192
00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.719
success will benefit the world no matter

193
00:07:32.59 --> 00:07:36.849
how repulsive we personally find their

194
00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:39.190
policies seventy percent of the Saudi

195
00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:40.900
population is under 30 years old and

196
00:07:39.19 --> 00:07:43.810
over the next ten years they're going to

197
00:07:40.9 --> 00:07:46.210
require two million jobs we all know

198
00:07:43.81 --> 00:07:48.370
that when frustration unemployment and

199
00:07:46.21 --> 00:07:51.279
religious fundamentalism add up the

200
00:07:48.37 --> 00:07:53.740
consequences can be truly dangerous to

201
00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:55.719
all the body has proved that moderation

202
00:07:53.74 --> 00:07:58.270
and capitalism can lead to changes in

203
00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:00.370
fundamentalist regimes we can only hope

204
00:07:58.27 --> 00:08:02.469
that Saudi Arabia can successfully

205
00:08:00.37 --> 00:08:04.449
follow the example that has been set by

206
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:06.250
Dubai but that is our opinion here at

207
00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:08.020
visual politic we want to know what you

208
00:08:06.25 --> 00:08:09.279
think do you think Saudi Arabia will

209
00:08:08.02 --> 00:08:11.259
succeed do you think it will

210
00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:13.810
successfully follow the examples that

211
00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:15.940
are since set by Dubai do you think that

212
00:08:13.81 --> 00:08:18.520
capitalism can encourage moderation in

213
00:08:15.94 --> 00:08:20.020
countries like Saudi Arabia do let us
