3
00:00:06.47 --> 00:00:11.519
El Salvador is a small country in fact

4
00:00:09.63 --> 00:00:14.630
it's the smallest country in all of

5
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.609
Central America but that's only

6
00:00:14.63 --> 00:00:19.830
geographically the country has 6.5

7
00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.289
million inhabitants a population that's

8
00:00:19.83 --> 00:00:24.210
larger than Panama Costa Rica Belize or

9
00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.830
Nicaragua that's a large population

10
00:00:24.21 --> 00:00:29.390
especially when you consider that

11
00:00:25.83 --> 00:00:31.920
emigration from the country is common

12
00:00:29.39 --> 00:00:34.500
according to various sources some three

13
00:00:31.92 --> 00:00:36.480
to four million Salvadorians are living

14
00:00:34.5 --> 00:00:37.020
abroad with many living in the United

15
00:00:36.48 --> 00:00:40.020
States

16
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:42.180
Don't Tell Trump disgusting I don't want

17
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:44.040
to talk about emigration is ever popular

18
00:00:42.18 --> 00:00:45.899
with thousands of Salvadorians

19
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:47.820
each year packing up their suitcases and

20
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.160
taking a chance on a better future

21
00:00:47.82 --> 00:00:55.469
somewhere else if this rate of

22
00:00:53.16 --> 00:00:57.360
emigration from El Salvador maintains

23
00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.340
itself then there might soon be more

24
00:00:57.36 --> 00:01:01.469
Salvadorians and living outside El

25
00:00:59.34 --> 00:01:03.420
Salvador than there are living inside it

26
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.100
so now you might be wondering why are so

27
00:01:03.42 --> 00:01:06.990
many people so keen to leave this

28
00:01:05.1 --> 00:01:08.670
country or you might not be wondering

29
00:01:06.99 --> 00:01:10.830
that I mean we did have to choose a

30
00:01:08.67 --> 00:01:12.570
title for this video but anyway so let's

31
00:01:10.83 --> 00:01:15.439
have a look at why so many people are

32
00:01:12.57 --> 00:01:15.439
leaving this country

33
00:01:15.69 --> 00:01:20.380
yes it is true that El Salvador is a

34
00:01:18.13 --> 00:01:22.570
very poor country that economics is not

35
00:01:20.38 --> 00:01:24.580
the only reason that people are leaving

36
00:01:22.57 --> 00:01:26.380
now before we get into details on what

37
00:01:24.58 --> 00:01:28.390
exactly is causing this Exodus let me

38
00:01:26.38 --> 00:01:30.490
give you a quick bit of information El

39
00:01:28.39 --> 00:01:32.530
Salvador is a tropical country where you

40
00:01:30.49 --> 00:01:34.660
can find stunning beaches like these as

41
00:01:32.53 --> 00:01:36.790
well as magnificent nature reserves like

42
00:01:34.66 --> 00:01:40.300
this one as well as amazing cultural

43
00:01:36.79 --> 00:01:42.150
remains and in 2017 this is a year in

44
00:01:40.3 --> 00:01:45.040
which the country should be celebrating

45
00:01:42.15 --> 00:01:46.960
2017 marked the 25th anniversary of the

46
00:01:45.04 --> 00:01:49.210
peace agreements which put an end to the

47
00:01:46.96 --> 00:01:51.780
bitter and cruel civil war which lasted

48
00:01:49.21 --> 00:01:59.110
more than 12 years and caused more than

49
00:01:51.78 --> 00:02:00.729
70,000 deaths this conflict was between

50
00:01:59.11 --> 00:02:03.010
the National Armed Forces and the

51
00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.479
so-called Farah bunzo Marti National

52
00:02:03.01 --> 00:02:06.369
Liberation Front a left wing

53
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.020
paramilitary group which counted on the

54
00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.910
support of the Cuban government

55
00:02:08.02 --> 00:02:11.200
interestingly after the peace agreements

56
00:02:09.91 --> 00:02:13.209
this guerrilla group who became a

57
00:02:11.2 --> 00:02:15.940
political party and today they have the

58
00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.700
presidency of the Republic quite the

59
00:02:15.94 --> 00:02:23.410
remarkable change in sterile operations

60
00:02:18.7 --> 00:02:24.970
yeah or what it is oh it's done it games

61
00:02:23.41 --> 00:02:27.730
yet it's not fighting yet

62
00:02:24.97 --> 00:02:29.590
now while this 25th anniversary should

63
00:02:27.73 --> 00:02:30.940
be a reason for celebration it's pretty

64
00:02:29.59 --> 00:02:33.340
hard to celebrate when you look at the

65
00:02:30.94 --> 00:02:39.220
current situation that El Salvador finds

66
00:02:33.34 --> 00:02:42.340
itself in the violence the 11th of

67
00:02:39.22 --> 00:02:44.350
January 2017 was a normal Wednesday

68
00:02:42.34 --> 00:02:46.720
where nothing extraordinary happened

69
00:02:44.35 --> 00:02:49.150
absolutely nothing so let me explain

70
00:02:46.72 --> 00:02:52.330
that day ended with a death toll of the

71
00:02:49.15 --> 00:02:54.340
0 in El Salvador and yes van non-events

72
00:02:52.33 --> 00:02:55.780
was actually front-page news the reason

73
00:02:54.34 --> 00:02:57.580
for this being newsworthy is that al

74
00:02:55.78 --> 00:03:00.340
salvador has become one of the most

75
00:02:57.58 --> 00:03:02.049
dangerous countries in the world now to

76
00:03:00.34 --> 00:03:06.090
give you an idea of how dire the

77
00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.709
situation is consider this in 2015

78
00:03:06.09 --> 00:03:12.120
6670 murders were registered that is to

79
00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.269
say there were 105 murders of every

80
00:03:12.12 --> 00:03:15.269
100,000 inhabitants

81
00:03:15.7 --> 00:03:21.080
this is the highest of any country in

82
00:03:18.65 --> 00:03:22.970
the world which is not currently a war

83
00:03:21.08 --> 00:03:24.470
zone this number is really truly

84
00:03:22.97 --> 00:03:26.450
terrifying and is perhaps best

85
00:03:24.47 --> 00:03:28.040
illustrated with a comparison if this

86
00:03:26.45 --> 00:03:30.350
figure were applied to the UK which

87
00:03:28.04 --> 00:03:32.540
means there were 70,000 murders a year

88
00:03:30.35 --> 00:03:34.640
in the country and what's the real

89
00:03:32.54 --> 00:03:36.160
figure for the UK well it's a touch more

90
00:03:34.64 --> 00:03:40.730
than 500 murders

91
00:03:36.16 --> 00:03:42.020
that's 140 times less in 2016 the

92
00:03:40.73 --> 00:03:44.180
figures were a bit lower but there was

93
00:03:42.02 --> 00:03:45.770
still four thousand murders registered

94
00:03:44.18 --> 00:03:47.780
this is madness there have been Wars

95
00:03:45.77 --> 00:03:49.820
well as people have died oh and believe

96
00:03:47.78 --> 00:03:51.440
me murder is far from the only serious

97
00:03:49.82 --> 00:03:53.960
crime going down in our Salvador

98
00:03:51.44 --> 00:03:56.450
kidnapping extortion theft they're all

99
00:03:53.96 --> 00:03:58.190
worryingly common so with all this great

100
00:03:56.45 --> 00:04:01.370
news well who's up for a holiday to El

101
00:03:58.19 --> 00:04:03.140
Salvador like no one oh what a surprise

102
00:04:01.37 --> 00:04:04.430
now given all of this information it's

103
00:04:03.14 --> 00:04:06.380
probably no surprise to you that

104
00:04:04.43 --> 00:04:08.510
according to recent surveys it's been

105
00:04:06.38 --> 00:04:10.700
indicated that nearly half of the

106
00:04:08.51 --> 00:04:12.410
population of El Salvador wants to leave

107
00:04:10.7 --> 00:04:14.390
and it's really clear to see that this

108
00:04:12.41 --> 00:04:16.040
violence has consequences and this isn't

109
00:04:14.39 --> 00:04:17.780
just a fear of crime being committed

110
00:04:16.04 --> 00:04:20.209
against you directly but it also affects

111
00:04:17.78 --> 00:04:21.530
the standard of living of all people in

112
00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.900
the country now according to the

113
00:04:21.53 --> 00:04:26.780
Salvadorian central bank violence costs

114
00:04:23.9 --> 00:04:28.220
around 4 billion u.s. dollars a year and

115
00:04:26.78 --> 00:04:29.720
you know what that's not really that

116
00:04:28.22 --> 00:04:31.550
surprising I mean after all if you want

117
00:04:29.72 --> 00:04:33.350
to invest their money in a country where

118
00:04:31.55 --> 00:04:35.540
you can be killed at pretty much any

119
00:04:33.35 --> 00:04:37.640
time do I believe me well how about this

120
00:04:35.54 --> 00:04:40.850
al Banaras foreign investment is the

121
00:04:37.64 --> 00:04:42.830
lowest in all of Central America even

122
00:04:40.85 --> 00:04:44.720
regular people are at risk in El

123
00:04:42.83 --> 00:04:45.980
Salvador in fact the statistics show

124
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:48.530
that you're more likely to be murdered

125
00:04:45.98 --> 00:04:50.090
as a bus driver rather than a policeman

126
00:04:48.53 --> 00:04:52.840
in the country in the last five years

127
00:04:50.09 --> 00:04:56.500
alone street gangs have killed almost

128
00:04:52.84 --> 00:04:59.710
700 bus drivers

129
00:04:56.5 --> 00:05:01.900
violence in the region now it is known

130
00:04:59.71 --> 00:05:03.940
globally that Latin America does have a

131
00:05:01.9 --> 00:05:05.770
serious problem with violence and crime

132
00:05:03.94 --> 00:05:07.420
according to a report from the British

133
00:05:05.77 --> 00:05:09.670
consulting firms various Maplecroft

134
00:05:07.42 --> 00:05:11.560
Latin America is the region where you

135
00:05:09.67 --> 00:05:13.300
have the highest risk of having a

136
00:05:11.56 --> 00:05:14.920
violent crime committed against you

137
00:05:13.3 --> 00:05:16.810
indeed six of the world's 10 most

138
00:05:14.92 --> 00:05:18.860
violent countries are actually in this

139
00:05:16.81 --> 00:05:21.120
region

140
00:05:18.86 --> 00:05:23.070
[Music]

141
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:25.530
more incredible than that though is the

142
00:05:23.07 --> 00:05:28.470
fact that one in three homicides that

143
00:05:25.53 --> 00:05:30.720
occur every year globally take place in

144
00:05:28.47 --> 00:05:32.340
Latin America even within this dangerous

145
00:05:30.72 --> 00:05:34.350
environment the northern triangle

146
00:05:32.34 --> 00:05:36.660
countries of Central America really

147
00:05:34.35 --> 00:05:39.240
takes a biscuit this area is formed of

148
00:05:36.66 --> 00:05:42.060
El Salvador Honduras and Guatemala and

149
00:05:39.24 --> 00:05:43.710
it is by far the most dangerous area on

150
00:05:42.06 --> 00:05:45.360
the continent in fact when you don't

151
00:05:43.71 --> 00:05:47.699
consider war zones it's actually the

152
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:49.290
most dangerous region in the world in

153
00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.810
these countries which are relatively

154
00:05:49.29 --> 00:05:53.350
small 200,000 people have been murdered

155
00:05:51.81 --> 00:05:57.630
since 2004

156
00:05:53.35 --> 00:05:59.220
[Music]

157
00:05:57.63 --> 00:06:01.050
when you think about the reality of

158
00:05:59.22 --> 00:06:02.490
these numbers is pretty easy to see why

159
00:06:01.05 --> 00:06:04.290
people want to leave you can't walk the

160
00:06:02.49 --> 00:06:06.000
street safely at night or wear a watch

161
00:06:04.29 --> 00:06:07.770
or a necklace or start a business

162
00:06:06.0 --> 00:06:10.290
without having to pay some criminal

163
00:06:07.77 --> 00:06:11.580
organization it kind of sucks so the

164
00:06:10.29 --> 00:06:15.190
question that must be on your mind right

165
00:06:11.58 --> 00:06:17.960
now is but why is there so much violence

166
00:06:15.19 --> 00:06:22.410
[Music]

167
00:06:17.96 --> 00:06:24.300
rap trafficking and murder good question

168
00:06:22.41 --> 00:06:26.310
that's probably on your mind now is just

169
00:06:24.3 --> 00:06:28.050
why is there so much violence now the

170
00:06:26.31 --> 00:06:29.640
reality is these countries in Central

171
00:06:28.05 --> 00:06:31.380
America have not always been such

172
00:06:29.64 --> 00:06:33.210
dangerous places it could even been

173
00:06:31.38 --> 00:06:35.190
considered relatively peaceful until

174
00:06:33.21 --> 00:06:37.230
about 20 years ago at least on an

175
00:06:35.19 --> 00:06:39.570
individual level but this all started to

176
00:06:37.23 --> 00:06:40.620
change by the end of the 80s and 90s for

177
00:06:39.57 --> 00:06:43.150
two reasons

178
00:06:40.62 --> 00:06:43.380
drug trafficking and Mari

179
00:06:43.15 --> 00:06:46.500
[Music]

180
00:06:43.38 --> 00:06:46.500
[Applause]

181
00:06:48.33 --> 00:06:52.530
first of all deep drug trafficking this

182
00:06:50.4 --> 00:06:55.229
is a serious problem in the region every

183
00:06:52.53 --> 00:06:57.090
year 22 million Americans use drugs and

184
00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.310
most of them come from South America the

185
00:06:57.09 --> 00:07:11.250
drug cartels are making an absolute

186
00:06:59.31 --> 00:07:12.750
fortune from this obviously this isn't

187
00:07:11.25 --> 00:07:14.190
anything new but this activity has

188
00:07:12.75 --> 00:07:16.020
evolved over the years and has

189
00:07:14.19 --> 00:07:18.000
continually found ways to operate a

190
00:07:16.02 --> 00:07:19.740
spite pressure from law enforcement the

191
00:07:18.0 --> 00:07:22.229
persecution of the famous Colombian drug

192
00:07:19.74 --> 00:07:24.180
cartels led to a shift in route of the

193
00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.979
drugs coming to the u.s. previously it

194
00:07:24.18 --> 00:07:27.900
went Colombia to the Caribbean islands

195
00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:29.969
to Florida now there's a new route that

196
00:07:27.9 --> 00:07:31.740
goes through Central America and this is

197
00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:33.900
the first big problem Central America

198
00:07:31.74 --> 00:07:35.759
has become a sort of sanctuary for new

199
00:07:33.9 --> 00:07:37.500
Mexican drug cartels from Central

200
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.810
America they can organize their business

201
00:07:37.5 --> 00:07:43.650
hide drugs and take refuge from justice

202
00:07:39.81 --> 00:07:45.509
whenever needed so now you're probably

203
00:07:43.65 --> 00:07:48.360
getting the idea experts have calculated

204
00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:50.550
that 80% of the drugs used in the US has

205
00:07:48.36 --> 00:07:52.440
to go through Honduras and this has led

206
00:07:50.55 --> 00:07:54.419
to an extraordinary amounts of violence

207
00:07:52.44 --> 00:07:56.310
in that region and now for the second

208
00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:57.870
major problem the maras for those of you

209
00:07:56.31 --> 00:07:59.550
don't know them the Mara's asks street

210
00:07:57.87 --> 00:08:01.349
gangs that engage in all kinds of

211
00:07:59.55 --> 00:08:03.060
criminal activities like seth's murder

212
00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:04.830
or extortion then and those are usually

213
00:08:03.06 --> 00:08:06.630
young people and their organization is

214
00:08:04.83 --> 00:08:07.979
relatively horizontal meaning that they

215
00:08:06.63 --> 00:08:10.020
don't have much of an organized

216
00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:11.520
hierarchy they organize in individual

217
00:08:10.02 --> 00:08:13.349
criminal cells which work quite

218
00:08:11.52 --> 00:08:15.060
independently from one another and do

219
00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:16.919
take note here because it is estimated

220
00:08:15.06 --> 00:08:20.639
that in these three countries alone

221
00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:21.990
damaris have around 70 to 100 thousand

222
00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:24.449
members noise famous of these

223
00:08:21.99 --> 00:08:26.909
organizations are Salva cuca and Barry

224
00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:28.500
o-18 and both usually fight against each

225
00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:33.539
other over the control of different

226
00:08:28.5 --> 00:08:35.729
territories I think in violence the

227
00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.589
situation is complex many strategies

228
00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:39.240
have been use to try and solve the

229
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:41.250
problem and they have all failed

230
00:08:39.24 --> 00:08:43.320
however two initiatives have been put

231
00:08:41.25 --> 00:08:45.000
into practice lately in order to change

232
00:08:43.32 --> 00:08:47.310
the reality of these countries and

233
00:08:45.0 --> 00:08:49.230
achieve safety for their citizens the

234
00:08:47.31 --> 00:08:51.060
first is known as the traditional task

235
00:08:49.23 --> 00:08:53.399
force this is a security apparatus

236
00:08:51.06 --> 00:08:55.350
formed by police officers intelligence

237
00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:57.149
experts and special units of the three

238
00:08:55.35 --> 00:08:58.649
countries that we've mentioned the end

239
00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:00.170
of this group is to fight street gangs

240
00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:02.570
drug trafficking and/or

241
00:09:00.17 --> 00:09:04.190
crime regardless of borders or things

242
00:09:02.57 --> 00:09:06.470
the group receives support training and

243
00:09:04.19 --> 00:09:08.720
financing from the United States the

244
00:09:06.47 --> 00:09:10.279
idea of this is clear as Quan Orlando

245
00:09:08.72 --> 00:09:14.480
Hernandez the president of Honduras

246
00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:17.570
likes to say we are going to give them a

247
00:09:14.48 --> 00:09:19.190
taste of their own medicine the second

248
00:09:17.57 --> 00:09:21.410
initiative is linked to the first and it

249
00:09:19.19 --> 00:09:22.880
is known as the Alliance of prosperity

250
00:09:21.41 --> 00:09:24.920
this was launched by the Obama

251
00:09:22.88 --> 00:09:26.360
administration and it expects to improve

252
00:09:24.92 --> 00:09:28.279
the living conditions and the

253
00:09:26.36 --> 00:09:30.139
competitiveness of these countries its

254
00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:31.970
main goal is to create jobs and

255
00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:34.250
essential infrastructure in order to

256
00:09:31.97 --> 00:09:35.810
reverse the terrible current situation

257
00:09:34.25 --> 00:09:39.320
to start Washington has already

258
00:09:35.81 --> 00:09:40.670
committed to spend 750 million dollars

259
00:09:39.32 --> 00:09:42.949
in order to support these initiatives

260
00:09:40.67 --> 00:09:45.320
but the question is really is there any

261
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:47.240
hope and the answer is well the sort of

262
00:09:45.32 --> 00:09:48.500
has to be matter Selva true ha has

263
00:09:47.24 --> 00:09:49.670
already communicated that they are

264
00:09:48.5 --> 00:09:51.649
willing to negotiate their own

265
00:09:49.67 --> 00:09:55.760
dismantling but only time will tell if

266
00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:57.260
it's successful so that's our view on

267
00:09:55.76 --> 00:09:58.760
the region here at visual politics but

268
00:09:57.26 --> 00:10:00.440
we would love to know what you think do

269
00:09:58.76 --> 00:10:02.120
you think these countries will manage to

270
00:10:00.44 --> 00:10:03.920
get rid of their criminal elements will

271
00:10:02.12 --> 00:10:05.180
the plans set by Washington succeed at

272
00:10:03.92 --> 00:10:07.640
all I'd love to know what you think and

273
00:10:05.18 --> 00:10:08.990
you can use the comments to do that and

274
00:10:07.64 --> 00:10:10.579

275
00:10:08.99 --> 00:10:12.380
this channel we can't answer all at the
