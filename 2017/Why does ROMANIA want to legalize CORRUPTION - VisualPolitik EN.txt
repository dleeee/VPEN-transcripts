3
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.450
Romania might be the first country in

4
00:00:09.0 --> 00:00:15.089
the world to legalize corruption yes you

5
00:00:12.45 --> 00:00:16.859
heard that right in January 2017 the

6
00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.750
Romanian Parliament passed an ordinance

7
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.439
which allowed politicians to accept

8
00:00:18.75 --> 00:00:24.240
bribes of almost $50,000 these bribes

9
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.849
could happen without any kind of legal

10
00:00:24.24 --> 00:00:28.859
repercussions whatsoever now as you can

11
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.289
imagine this infamous ordinance triggers

12
00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.340
one of the biggest political

13
00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:40.620
demonstrations that the country has seen

14
00:00:32.34 --> 00:00:41.730
for over 20 years the protest led to the

15
00:00:40.62 --> 00:00:43.980
government suspending the law

16
00:00:41.73 --> 00:00:46.289
temporarily but even after this protest

17
00:00:43.98 --> 00:00:48.030
continued Romanians their rather used to

18
00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.010
living in Europe's most corrupt country

19
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:52.230
and this ignominious decree was the

20
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:54.180
final straw that broke the camel's back

21
00:00:52.23 --> 00:00:55.829
but the big question is how did they get

22
00:00:54.18 --> 00:00:57.390
to this point and what's going on in the

23
00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.730
country that could make its government

24
00:00:57.39 --> 00:01:01.620
pass this kind of law without feeling

25
00:00:59.73 --> 00:01:03.270
any sort of shame well today we're

26
00:01:01.62 --> 00:01:05.369
getting down to this question but before

27
00:01:03.27 --> 00:01:07.790
we do that let's take a look at the

28
00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.790
history

29
00:01:07.87 --> 00:01:12.770
[Music]

30
00:01:09.05 --> 00:01:14.330
the European North Korea he calls

31
00:01:12.77 --> 00:01:16.670
understand romanian history without

32
00:01:14.33 --> 00:01:19.780
knowing it our Nicolae Ceausescu the

33
00:01:16.67 --> 00:01:19.780
European Kim Jong

34
00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.560
now other neighboring countries like

35
00:01:24.64 --> 00:01:28.749
Hungary or Bulgaria have suffered

36
00:01:26.56 --> 00:01:31.929
communist dictatorships - that the story

37
00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:34.509
of Romania is special since cherisheth

38
00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.609
coup came to power in 1974 his country

39
00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.340
has been isolated from the rest and even

40
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:43.390
from the Soviet Union itself soon even

41
00:01:39.34 --> 00:01:45.219
food started to become scarce while

42
00:01:43.39 --> 00:01:47.469
citizens had their meals rationed by the

43
00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.810
state Chiao Chesky spent money building

44
00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.579
sparrow like palaces for instance here

45
00:01:49.81 --> 00:01:53.829
is the Parliament of Bucharest the built

46
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.479
in 1983 and the names of the biggest

47
00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.439
administrative building in the entire

48
00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.869
world

49
00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.219
this is especially amazing if we take

50
00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.340
into account that the Romanian

51
00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.590
population is no bigger than 22 million

52
00:02:03.34 --> 00:02:07.569
inhabitants during the construction of

53
00:02:05.59 --> 00:02:10.720
the building more than 20,000 people

54
00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.209
were employed and around 3,000 died of

55
00:02:10.72 --> 00:02:15.220
exhaustion but not only that coughs

56
00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.190
enforced his citizens to participate in

57
00:02:15.22 --> 00:02:22.299

internal change a certain summation will

63
00:02:32.98 --> 00:02:36.880
no longer make arrests just like his

64
00:02:34.45 --> 00:02:38.650
north korean comrades Ceausescu was a

65
00:02:36.88 --> 00:02:42.190
master in the art of political

66
00:02:38.65 --> 00:02:44.950
repression during 1980s an estimate of 1

in every 30 Romanians belongs to the

neighbor

your hairdresser or anyone really

71
00:02:49.45 --> 00:02:53.980
meaning any time you said something bad

72
00:02:52.06 --> 00:02:56.079
about the leader you could end up

73
00:02:53.98 --> 00:02:58.810
spending the rest of your days in jail

74
00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.060
simply just disappear nonetheless

75
00:02:58.81 --> 00:03:03.090
despite all of this being a dictator

76
00:03:01.06 --> 00:03:05.890
needs not a safe job

[Music]

78
00:03:05.89 --> 00:03:10.940
this footage is from Chow at KU the last

79
00:03:08.81 --> 00:03:13.550
speech which took place on the 21st of

80
00:03:10.94 --> 00:03:15.980
December 1989 look at his facial

81
00:03:13.55 --> 00:03:18.470
expression and how it starts to tremble

82
00:03:15.98 --> 00:03:21.520
it was at this moment that the audience

83
00:03:18.47 --> 00:03:21.520
started to boo him

84
00:03:24.58 --> 00:03:28.660
this is how the biggest protest in

85
00:03:26.59 --> 00:03:30.910
Romanian history started thousands of

86
00:03:28.66 --> 00:03:32.590
citizens stepped out on the streets with

87
00:03:30.91 --> 00:03:34.630
national flags where the communist

88
00:03:32.59 --> 00:03:36.790
symbols had been cut out three days

89
00:03:34.63 --> 00:03:39.460
later on Christmas Day of that year

90
00:03:36.79 --> 00:03:42.250
Nicolae Ceausescu died next to his wife

91
00:03:39.46 --> 00:03:43.420
killed by his own party colleagues his

92
00:03:42.25 --> 00:03:47.190
last words were

93
00:03:43.42 --> 00:03:47.190
history will Avenger

94
00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.040
and so now you might be wondering well

95
00:03:52.43 --> 00:03:56.780
what happened next the truth is in such

96
00:03:55.04 --> 00:03:58.640
an oppressive regime as child Cheska's

97
00:03:56.78 --> 00:04:01.250
there were no opposition needed

98
00:03:58.64 --> 00:04:02.870
whatsoever just innately comparison in

99
00:04:01.25 --> 00:04:04.760
Poland when the communist regime fell

100
00:04:02.87 --> 00:04:06.920
there were powerful leaders like less

101
00:04:04.76 --> 00:04:09.709
well ASA who has much popular support

102
00:04:06.92 --> 00:04:11.719
and helps write a brand new constitution

103
00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.019
for the country nevertheless eveything

104
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:17.660
succeeded Ceausescu in Romania well that

105
00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.100
would be his own party comrade more

106
00:04:17.66 --> 00:04:21.169
exactly that would be the man whom you

107
00:04:19.1 --> 00:04:28.280
see on the screen now and his name is

108
00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:29.990
young EBS cute as you can imagine this

109
00:04:28.28 --> 00:04:31.970
government was not willing to give up

110
00:04:29.99 --> 00:04:35.509
the luxuries that they had during church

111
00:04:31.97 --> 00:04:37.820
a few times so I always happens in cases

112
00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.220
like this the Romanian regime changed

113
00:04:37.82 --> 00:04:42.080
but just a little of course the new

114
00:04:40.22 --> 00:04:44.060
constitution allow the other parties to

115
00:04:42.08 --> 00:04:45.620
run for elections then the old Communist

116
00:04:44.06 --> 00:04:47.960
Party changed its name to the social

117
00:04:45.62 --> 00:04:49.729
democratic party but the high ranking

118
00:04:47.96 --> 00:04:51.800
officials that ruled the country during

119
00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.159
these dictatorships kept their power

120
00:04:51.8 --> 00:04:57.110
during the 1990s and the 2000 so as you

121
00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.479
probably know if power corrupts wealth

122
00:04:57.11 --> 00:05:01.479
absolute power it corrupts absolutely

123
00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.129
for a better understanding of this in

124
00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.159
1995 50% of the Polish economy was

125
00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:15.449
already in private hands but in Romania

126
00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:17.729
this figure with only 35% so let's have

127
00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.039
a look at an example let's take two car

128
00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.169
manufacturers Czechoslovakia had a

129
00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.439
state-owned factory Skoda that was

130
00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.629
privatized in 1992 by sharing the under

131
00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.939
ship among the workers its Romanian

132
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:33.210
counterpart Dacia was not privatized

133
00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.610
until 1997 and instead of doing it by

134
00:05:33.21 --> 00:05:37.770
sharing it it was simply sold to Rene in

135
00:05:35.61 --> 00:05:39.689
other words during the 90s in the 2000s

136
00:05:37.77 --> 00:05:42.120
the ruling elite in Romania did whatever

137
00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.550
they could importer to keep control of

138
00:05:42.12 --> 00:05:45.990
the economy and the country it was only

139
00:05:44.55 --> 00:05:49.380
through these actions that they were

140
00:05:45.99 --> 00:05:57.110
able to keep a hold on their power

141
00:05:49.38 --> 00:05:58.980
[Music]

142
00:05:57.11 --> 00:06:01.290
wait just a second here because

143
00:05:58.98 --> 00:06:03.360
corruption was present at lower levels

144
00:06:01.29 --> 00:06:05.700
as well in a country that had been so

145
00:06:03.36 --> 00:06:08.880
used to scarcity it was impossible to

146
00:06:05.7 --> 00:06:10.410
get anything without a little brine you

147
00:06:08.88 --> 00:06:12.540
want to go to the doctor well bring a

148
00:06:10.41 --> 00:06:13.950
box of cigarettes with you and what

149
00:06:12.54 --> 00:06:16.500
about to have electricity at home

150
00:06:13.95 --> 00:06:18.660
whiskey bottled men's everything sorted

151
00:06:16.5 --> 00:06:21.070
out and that is how in this country

152
00:06:18.66 --> 00:06:23.919
corruption became a way of life

153
00:06:21.07 --> 00:06:26.169
[Music]

154
00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.569
and now you might be wondering is it

155
00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.650
really possible for a country to work

156
00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.819
this way and the answer is well no

157
00:06:31.65 --> 00:06:35.499
Romanians saw how our the former

158
00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.569
communist republics such as the Czech

159
00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.669
Republic or Poland started enjoying a

160
00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:42.219
Western standard of living while they

161
00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.529
kept surviving on less than $400 a month

162
00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:46.840
this is why in the middle of 2000

163
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.789
Romania requested to become a member of

164
00:06:46.84 --> 00:06:50.800
the European Union so that they could

165
00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.650
get access to some of those sweet sweet

166
00:06:50.8 --> 00:06:55.840
EU funds and Brussels basically said

167
00:06:53.65 --> 00:07:02.139
okay man I'll let you in that there's

168
00:06:55.84 --> 00:07:04.750
one condition and that condition was the

169
00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.939
National anti-corruption Directorate in

170
00:07:04.75 --> 00:07:09.370
the year 2002 the Romanian government

171
00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:11.610
founded an agency to chase corruption

172
00:07:09.37 --> 00:07:14.469
the National anti-corruption Directorate

173
00:07:11.61 --> 00:07:16.750
for its first few years this agency was

174
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.849
directed by prosecutors connected to the

175
00:07:16.75 --> 00:07:21.009
party leaders so this was basically the

176
00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.599
Romanian way of saying hey brothel look

177
00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.400
at us we're doing great look at all this

178
00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:27.009
corruption we're tackling with cleaning

179
00:07:24.4 --> 00:07:34.960
up everything but then again not

180
00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:38.319
surprisingly nothing changed that was

181
00:07:34.96 --> 00:07:39.819
until the year 2013 that is the year

182
00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.159
when a woman came to lead the

183
00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:45.580
directorate a woman ready to face

184
00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:49.500
everything and everyone and her name is

185
00:07:45.58 --> 00:07:49.500
laura kadru Zhirkov AC

186
00:07:52.63 --> 00:07:57.680
Damien's seemed to have been impressed

187
00:07:55.07 --> 00:08:00.290
by the activities of the DNA according

188
00:07:57.68 --> 00:08:02.660
to one recent poll 60% of people said

189
00:08:00.29 --> 00:08:04.880
they trusted the agency while only 11

190
00:08:02.66 --> 00:08:06.590
percent say they trusted program in just

191
00:08:04.88 --> 00:08:09.860
two years because they see his jails

192
00:08:06.59 --> 00:08:12.170
more than 1100 politicians accused of

193
00:08:09.86 --> 00:08:14.030
corruption during these years Romanians

194
00:08:12.17 --> 00:08:16.640
have discovered all of the dirty things

195
00:08:14.03 --> 00:08:19.190
their ruling class were hiding and these

196
00:08:16.64 --> 00:08:22.160
are no small things according to an

197
00:08:19.19 --> 00:08:25.760
estimate corruption accounts for 15% of

198
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:28.190
Romanian GDP virtually all the public

199
00:08:25.76 --> 00:08:30.410
sales had some kind of right involved

200
00:08:28.19 --> 00:08:32.780
even the Microsoft licenses that the

201
00:08:30.41 --> 00:08:34.640
civil servants used at a cost of over 3

202
00:08:32.78 --> 00:08:39.010
million dollars which were used to pay

203
00:08:34.64 --> 00:08:39.010
bribes to different government official

204
00:08:40.37 --> 00:08:43.509
[Music]

205
00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:45.579
then there was the case of a judge who

206
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:47.170
was paid around seven hundred thousand

207
00:08:45.579 --> 00:08:50.529
dollars in order to declare someone

208
00:08:47.17 --> 00:08:52.689
innocent who is actually guilty and look

209
00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:54.129
this list it just goes on and on and on

210
00:08:52.689 --> 00:08:56.980
and I don't want to make that the rest

211
00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:58.689
of this video but since the year 2013

212
00:08:56.98 --> 00:09:00.850
basically all of these criminals they

213
00:08:58.689 --> 00:09:02.800
think filling up the Romanian jails to

214
00:09:00.85 --> 00:09:05.230
the point that some of the prisons have

215
00:09:02.8 --> 00:09:07.839
no space anymore but not only that

216
00:09:05.23 --> 00:09:10.389
romanian society itself has started to

217
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:13.300
realize just how damaging corruption is

218
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:13.990
but the real turning point came a little

219
00:09:13.3 --> 00:09:18.429
bit later

220
00:09:13.99 --> 00:09:21.160
with this news Romanian nightclub fire

221
00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:24.129
leaves 27 dead this news triggered a

222
00:09:21.16 --> 00:09:26.019
wave of protests all across Romania

223
00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:27.850
apparently this fire could have been

224
00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:30.009
avoided if the club would have met

225
00:09:27.85 --> 00:09:32.079
safety regulations that since the owner

226
00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:34.059
had bribed the local authorities he

227
00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:36.160
could open the club without breaking the

228
00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:38.499
rules this is how a platform came to be

229
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:40.869
called the corruption and chi-x or

230
00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:42.939
corruption kills in English through

231
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:45.069
social media Romanians started to

232
00:09:42.939 --> 00:09:47.889
organize themselves in protest groups

233
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:50.199
against corruption oh but just hold on

234
00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:52.620
for a minute because the best is really

235
00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:52.620
at the cup

236
00:09:53.26 --> 00:09:59.740
the biggest demonstrations in Romanian

237
00:09:56.2 --> 00:10:01.780
history on January 18th 2017 at 10 p.m.

238
00:09:59.74 --> 00:10:04.180
the social democratic government and its

239
00:10:01.78 --> 00:10:07.660
prime minister Soren grinde anno passed

240
00:10:04.18 --> 00:10:09.280
an emergency bill and yes they did do it

241
00:10:07.66 --> 00:10:12.910
at night when everyone was about to go

242
00:10:09.28 --> 00:10:14.740
to bed so what did this decree say well

243
00:10:12.91 --> 00:10:17.350
it said the politicians who accepted

244
00:10:14.74 --> 00:10:20.080
bribes for less than 44 thousand euros

245
00:10:17.35 --> 00:10:22.990
did not have to say jail time or pay any

246
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:25.540
fines nothing at all it was absolutely

247
00:10:22.99 --> 00:10:30.100
fine with the law to be bribed up to

248
00:10:25.54 --> 00:10:31.600
that amount and if you like if you

249
00:10:30.1 --> 00:10:33.400
notice that they discussed this little

250
00:10:31.6 --> 00:10:35.200
well debating the national budget as

251
00:10:33.4 --> 00:10:37.720
normal phone no one would notice the

252
00:10:35.2 --> 00:10:40.300
change so now you might be wondering who

253
00:10:37.72 --> 00:10:42.550
can possibly dare to pass such a bold

254
00:10:40.3 --> 00:10:44.440
law I mean what could possibly be the

255
00:10:42.55 --> 00:10:47.110
official reason behind the

256
00:10:44.44 --> 00:10:49.060
decriminalization of bribery well this

257
00:10:47.11 --> 00:10:53.470
is the reason given by the Romanian

258
00:10:49.06 --> 00:10:55.780
Prime Minister wants to pass the

259
00:10:53.47 --> 00:10:58.680
ordinances into law to ease overcrowding

260
00:10:55.78 --> 00:11:01.360
in prisons yes this was the actual

261
00:10:58.68 --> 00:11:05.140
reason given by the Romanian government

262
00:11:01.36 --> 00:11:07.180
and spin just like that over 3,000

263
00:11:05.14 --> 00:11:08.890
corrupt politicians could be freed and

264
00:11:07.18 --> 00:11:10.750
he has well it is true the Romanian

265
00:11:08.89 --> 00:11:12.580
jails are overcrowded in a country where

266
00:11:10.75 --> 00:11:15.100
money is drained from the system by

267
00:11:12.58 --> 00:11:17.920
bribery it shouldn't be too difficult to

268
00:11:15.1 --> 00:11:19.390
find new funds for new prisons also the

269
00:11:17.92 --> 00:11:20.950
Faculty majority of the jail's

270
00:11:19.39 --> 00:11:23.040
politicians belong to the government

271
00:11:20.95 --> 00:11:26.140
party does make it slightly more

272
00:11:23.04 --> 00:11:27.880
suspicious don't you think well half a

273
00:11:26.14 --> 00:11:29.470
million Romanians thought so too and

274
00:11:27.88 --> 00:11:31.660
they took to the streets of Bucharest

275
00:11:29.47 --> 00:11:33.230
minutes after the decree with paths from

276
00:11:31.66 --> 00:11:34.730
these people

277
00:11:33.23 --> 00:11:36.890
feels that they've been cheated that

278
00:11:34.73 --> 00:11:38.780
these people the smoothie previously

279
00:11:36.89 --> 00:11:40.370
established corruption kills platform

280
00:11:38.78 --> 00:11:43.550
citizens learned about this news

281
00:11:40.37 --> 00:11:45.620
instantly and why they did not like it

282
00:11:43.55 --> 00:11:50.170
at all and that is how the biggest

283
00:11:45.62 --> 00:11:50.170
protest in Romanian history started

284
00:11:52.25 --> 00:11:56.150
I never dared to think that this was

285
00:11:54.29 --> 00:11:58.370
possible I've always thought there was

286
00:11:56.15 --> 00:12:01.010
some logic some common sense that would

287
00:11:58.37 --> 00:12:04.430
lead to a valid law but when I saw what

288
00:12:01.01 --> 00:12:06.140
happened I knew I was wrong the protests

289
00:12:04.43 --> 00:12:08.660
kept going for days not only in

290
00:12:06.14 --> 00:12:10.640
Bucharest but in most Romanian cities

291
00:12:08.66 --> 00:12:12.320
the first victim of the unrest was the

292
00:12:10.64 --> 00:12:15.140
Justice Minister who was forced to

293
00:12:12.32 --> 00:12:16.460
resign on the 9th of February 2017 as we

294
00:12:15.14 --> 00:12:18.110
mentioned the protests led to the

295
00:12:16.46 --> 00:12:20.060
government retiring this new law

296
00:12:18.11 --> 00:12:21.920
although they have already admitted that

297
00:12:20.06 --> 00:12:23.690
this is just temporary further the

298
00:12:21.92 --> 00:12:26.570
brand-new justice minister to darrell's

299
00:12:23.69 --> 00:12:28.940
Jota has a clear mission to justify the

300
00:12:26.57 --> 00:12:30.890
firing of the general prosecutor Laura

301
00:12:28.94 --> 00:12:33.260
could researcher they seemed women who

302
00:12:30.89 --> 00:12:35.180
jailed over 1,000 politicians the

303
00:12:33.26 --> 00:12:37.970
government claims that her agency is

304
00:12:35.18 --> 00:12:42.790
running a witch but they still haven't

305
00:12:37.97 --> 00:12:42.790
found a way to legally fire her yet

306
00:12:42.94 --> 00:12:47.240
after evaluating all the

307
00:12:44.99 --> 00:12:50.090
constitutionality legality and

308
00:12:47.24 --> 00:12:52.640
opportunity factors I determined that at

309
00:12:50.09 --> 00:12:55.340
the moment it's not advisable to start

310
00:12:52.64 --> 00:12:57.950
the institutional mechanism to revoke

311
00:12:55.34 --> 00:13:00.020
the general prosecutor and the DNA chief

312
00:12:57.95 --> 00:13:01.460
prosecutor at the same time Grinde Ana's

313
00:13:00.02 --> 00:13:03.680
government is confronted by two

314
00:13:01.46 --> 00:13:05.690
different sites on the one hand civil

315
00:13:03.68 --> 00:13:07.339
society is surveying his movements on

316
00:13:05.69 --> 00:13:09.230
the other hand the European Union is

317
00:13:07.339 --> 00:13:11.330
demanding that he stop obstructing the

318
00:13:09.23 --> 00:13:13.310
anti-corruption prosecutor and of course

319
00:13:11.33 --> 00:13:15.530
all of the political elite inheritors of

320
00:13:13.31 --> 00:13:17.720
Ceausescu's regime are turning to

321
00:13:15.53 --> 00:13:19.310
classic conspiracy theories do protect

322
00:13:17.72 --> 00:13:21.350
themselves according to them George

323
00:13:19.31 --> 00:13:24.170
Soros and the Rothschild family are

324
00:13:21.35 --> 00:13:26.360
behind the protesters and they say of

325
00:13:24.17 --> 00:13:28.460
course that corruption is not actually a

326
00:13:26.36 --> 00:13:29.960
big deal in Romania at all well with or

327
00:13:28.46 --> 00:13:32.210
without conspiracies we are still

328
00:13:29.96 --> 00:13:36.190
talking about an existential crisis in

329
00:13:32.21 --> 00:13:36.190
Europe third poorest country

330
00:13:39.66 --> 00:13:43.560
so now the question is do you think

331
00:13:41.79 --> 00:13:45.000
Romania should jail all of their

332
00:13:43.56 --> 00:13:46.260
corrupted politicians or do you think

333
00:13:45.0 --> 00:13:47.850
that instead the Prime Minister is

334
00:13:46.26 --> 00:13:50.250
actually doing something right by

335
00:13:47.85 --> 00:13:53.120
decriminalizing bribery you can leave
