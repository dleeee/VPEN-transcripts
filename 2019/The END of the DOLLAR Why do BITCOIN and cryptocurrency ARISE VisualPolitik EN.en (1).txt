10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,469
we're going to talk about what is

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,480
perhaps the most disruptive innovation

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,969
since the invention of the internet but

13
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,219
first we're gonna ask you one thing and

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,469
do let your imagination fly here try to

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,130
think and conventionally

[Music]

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,620
they ready let me start with some

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,690
questions can you imagine a new form of

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,700
money can you imagine companies run by

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,860
non human owners can you imagine a

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,410
company whose owner is a few lines of

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,990
code located in the digital cloud can

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,000
you imagine a company or an NGO with no

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,550
human workers folks 2018 it wasn't

25
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,800
bitcoins year I think we all know that

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,960
lately every bit of news related to this

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,120
currency has sounded extremely worrying

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,290
[Music]

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,729
bitcoins crash looks like a real

30
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,000
currency crisis bitcoin is in crisis you

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
can never really declare it dead but its

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,440
price has slumped 80 percent in less

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,990
than a year wiping out 700 billion

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,160
dollars of cryptocurrency markets

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,380
Bitcoin biggest bubble in history says

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,750
economists who predicted 2008 crash

37
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,930
Nouriel Roubini calls cryptocurrency the

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,440
mother of all bubbles the only currency

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,840
worse than Bitcoin is Venezuela's

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,049
Bitcoin is worthless artificial gold

41
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,450
bitcoin reminds me of Oscar Wilde's

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,150
definition of focsani the pursuit of the

43
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,760
uneatable by the unspeakable Bitcoin and

44
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,220
Aiko's it's one of the crazier

45
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,410
speculative things

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,480
but wait just a second because in spite

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,520
of everything it brought about a Bitcoin

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,800
is more than just a currency blockchain

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,630
the technology that supports it could

50
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,340
become nothing less than the operating

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,340
system of an entirely new economy a key

52
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,830
instrument for organizing the Society of

53
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,690
the future we're talking about a system

54
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,220
that could allow us to create a very

55
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,140
different society than the one we all

56
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,630
know a society organized in innovative

57
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,819
ways without hierarchical entities

58
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,340
without borders a new perfectly

59
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,560
decentralized society and if you're

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,209
thinking this sounds just like the

61
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,590
internet when you're kind of right

62
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,600
there's some really good technology in

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,630
terms of sharing databases and verifying

64
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,360
transactions that is talked about as

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,430
blockchain that is a good thing for the

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,560
first time in the history of mankind's

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,510
this technology can render politicians

68
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,940
banks governments and large corporations

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,910
as we know them nearly obsolete when it

70
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,680
comes to our money here on visual

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,239
politic we've already talked about the

72
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,739
applications and changes that

73
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,360
cryptocurrency and blockchain are

74
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,860
causing we do told you about how one

75
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,420
Swiss can zone wants to become the new

76
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,370
capital of the icos

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,079
well now we want to look towards the

78
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,100
future so let's talk about

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,810
cryptocurrencies let's talk about

80
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,549
blockchain and let's talk about smart

81
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,620
contracts because folks saying that this

82
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,450
technology is simply money is like

83
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,730
saying that the Internet is just email

84
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,530
[Music]

85
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,180
but hold on a second before we move on

86
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,950
we need to know the exact meaning of

87
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,110
Bitcoin and what it brings to society

88
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,970
first we'll take a look at money

89
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,220
what exactly is money what problems does

90
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,530
it pose how useful is cryptocurrency

91
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,140
well listen up

92
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,610
the origin of money folks

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,200
you use it every day but if you ever

94
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
really asked yourself well what is money

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,300
why do we value these little pieces of

96
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,950
paper quite so much what's the

97
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,750
difference between monopoly money and

98
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,540
actual paper money why is this worth

99
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,470
more than the other

100
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,019
how is its value determines taking an

101
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,579
example if you ever got lost in a desert

102
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,980
which we define more valuable a $100

103
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,710
bill a diamond or five liters of water

104
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,240
in other words how much would you pay

105
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,280
for a nice cold drink in the middle of

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,780
the Sahara there's no need to really

107
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,040
think about that obviously it's not a

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,830
serious question

109
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,990
[Music]

110
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,840
[Applause]

111
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,910
what we want to get across is that we

112
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,610
value things completely subjectively the

113
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,590
money we all know though those coins we

114
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,240
carry in our pockets have a certain

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,550
value simply because we all agreed to

116
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,290
give them that value of course we've

117
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,270
never held a meeting to discuss it we've

118
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,160
never voted or agreed on it or anything

119
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,200
like that which is sort of paradoxical

120
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,220
when you think about it by the way for

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,330
those who are tempted to think that

122
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,669
money's value is set by governments just

123
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,230
think about what happened to the Bolivar

124
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,720
in Venezuela

125
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,010
[Music]

126
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,260
what exactly is money don't be deceived

127
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,570
money is nothing more than a language a

128
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,880
linguistic abstraction with money we

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,950
transmit the idea of value to each other

130
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,330
for example that's what we do when we

131
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,100
say that a house is worth so much in

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,940
euros or dollars in other words the

133
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,680
value of things is very personal and

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,419
depends on how useful and worthwhile

135
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,760
that thing is to each of us and money is

136
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,830
no different its value isn't set in

137
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,750
stone it depends on the decisions we

138
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,970
make every day every hour every instance

139
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,520
that is the paper itself is worth next

140
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,330
to nothing therefore saying that a

141
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,430
cryptocurrency can't have value because

142
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,020
it's in the cloud it doesn't make sense

143
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,570
it can have the same value as any other

144
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,169
currency

145
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:56,940
having said that folks let's take a look

146
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,160
at a slightly scarier feature one where

147
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,690
there's a huge difference between

148
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,850
cryptocurrencies and conventional money

149
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,860
do you know that no matter where you

150
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,570
live every day you're a victim of a

151
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,639
small robbery listen up because this is

152
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,470
probably modern money's largest defect

153
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:21,710
an unstoppable depreciation we've said

154
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,150
it plenty of times here on visual

155
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,980
politic the money we all use every day

156
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,930
the paper currency those coins we have

157
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,750
in our pockets they have a huge defect

158
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,160
and that's that they're issued by

159
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,140
governments and public institutions and

160
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,360
yes the central bank is also a public

161
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,160
institution that is ultimately how

162
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,050
politicians control how much money is

163
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,300
issued let's not deceive ourselves here

164
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,370
these politicians will always want to

165
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,760
speed up the money-making machine now

166
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,620
this poses a huge problem is like being

167
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,810
robbed without really noticing it allow

168
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,310
me to explain myself when a government

169
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,290
prints more money it creates inflation

170
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,480
that is money loses its purchasing power

171
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,630
and the money's value dilutes and that's

172
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,640
happening to all the money and all the

173
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,990
savings that you've gathered in that

174
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,590
currency Venezuela's currency plums

175
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,740
unknown depths hyperinflation has seen

176
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,040
the Bolivar lose 99.9 percent of its

177
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,410
value in two years but you may be

178
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,330
thinking wow all right Simon I mean fine

179
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,130
but surely this only happens in

180
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,780
developing countries or those with

181
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,330
populist government's right well no

182
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,520
that's not in the least true yes

183
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,410
evidently in these sorts of countries

184
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,300
that process tends to be quicker but

185
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,280
historically no currency has ever

186
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,020
maintained its value for more than a

187
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,700
generation let's take a look at the

188
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,740
dollar the most popular world currency

189
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,680
today

190
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,840
well nowadays the dollar is worth 2% of

191
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,520
what it was worth a century ago and

192
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
that's due to decisions made in

193
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,250
Washington over the last hundred years

194
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,930
that has caused the dollar to lose 98

195
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,830
percent of its value surprised well Toby

196
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,240
because this problem is really nothing

197
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,460
new the problem indeed existed in

198
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,650
ancient Rome Emperor Diocletian for

199
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,330
example was infamous for creating

200
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,190
soaring inflation rates and then trying

201
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,050
to fix them by setting maximum prices

202
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,940
but at this point you might have a

203
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,740
couple of questions if the result is

204
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,090
always the same

205
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,889
why the hell does the government have a

206
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,110
monopoly on money and second is there a

207
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,669
way to prevent politicians from being

208
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,349
tempted to print more money or to create

209
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,270
more digital money which is even quicker

210
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,070
and easier well this is where an almost

211
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,229
insurmountable obstacle automatically

212
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:25,849
arises see it's hard to stop a

213
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,979
politician from being tempted to print

214
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,200
bills

215
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,539
and this has been attempted in several

216
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,490
ways for example by formally turning

217
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,079
central banks into apparently

218
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:40,389
independent entities but no this didn't

219
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,039
work much either among other things this

220
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,810
is because politicians end up appointing

221
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,920
the people who run those central banks

222
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,079
but what if money was separated from the

223
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,670
state allow me to explain because this

224
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,290
isn't actually a concept that's that odd

225
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,579
many people watching this video will

226
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,110
believe that separating church from

227
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,940
state is a good idea or separating

228
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,829
powers that guarantee an independent

229
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,570
judiciary so the question becomes why

230
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,430
not do the same thing with money what if

231
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,410
we the people everyday citizens created

232
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,540
our own currency behind the politicians

233
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:14,709
backs in a way this is precisely what

234
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:15,940
many people who support the gold

235
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,800
standard wants that is they want us to

236
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,930
go back to using gold as a currency this

237
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,060
is because gold it just can't be created

238
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,800
out of thin air but hold on a second

239
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,149
because this would be massively

240
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,500
inconvenience and it wouldn't solve the

241
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,329
problem historically banks politicians

242
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,040
and others have always managed to make

243
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,529
more money but this this is the 21st

244
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,029
century I mean isn't there a better

245
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,130
solution what if we think in a

246
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,800
disruptive way well this is exactly

247
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,110
where cryptocurrencies come in so listen

248
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,360
up

249
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,360
[Music]

250
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,839
welcome Bitcoin welcome Satoshi January

251
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,829
the 3rd 2009 1845 Greenwich Mean Time in

252
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,089
an unknown location

253
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,009
an unknown programmer nicknamed Satoshi

254
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,259
Nakamoto created the first blockchain

255
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,689
it's the so-called Genesis block of the

256
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,639
blockchain and with that bitcoin was

257
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,890
born

258
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,200
now a lot has been said about Bitcoin

259
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,730
and cryptocurrencies you can find all

260
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,470
sorts of technical information online so

261
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,540
no that's not going to be what we're

262
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,340
going to cover right now on visual

263
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,600
politic we want to deal with it

264
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,340
differently we want to see the entire

265
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,810
thing from a point of view that takes

266
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,550
all of this technology's future

267
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,870
implications into account because folks

268
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,430
Bitcoin has some very special

269
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,170
characteristics that make it quite

270
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,790
unique and it isn't just that with

271
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,590
Bitcoin you can pay for something on the

272
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,820
other side of the world pretty quickly

273
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,530
although it's a deflationary currency

274
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,700
because no one's ever gonna be able to

275
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,170
make more than 21 million bitcoins

276
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,300
perhaps the most important thing is that

277
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,670
bitcoin is controlled by nothing and

278
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,950
nobody not even its creator Satoshi

279
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,680
Nakamoto nobody is in charge of Bitcoin

280
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,810
no scientists no corporation no bank no

281
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,820
company it's a completely decentralized

282
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,000
system it's people thus who freely and

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,180
spontaneously givers or remove its value

284
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,990
so now you might be beginning to

285
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,150
understand nobody controls it nobody

286
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,160
censors it nobody can limit it with

287
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,440
Bitcoin you don't even need to identify

288
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,790
yourself which means that nobody can

289
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,490
know what you spent your money on this

290
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,110
is very different from what happens when

291
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,600
we pay with Visa or American Express all

292
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,490
the information about our expenses the

293
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,230
way in which we spend our money what we

294
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,570
do at all times is within these

295
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,460
companies reach and of course they give

296
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,730
it to the country's current politicians

297
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,320
but what if we want to spend our money

298
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,180
without people finding out what we do

299
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,890
with this in Europe and the u.s. this

300
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,020
might not seem that important but think

301
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,190
about what this would mean for the

302
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,840
people in countries like Cuba or

303
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,360
Nicaragua or Saudi Arabia there you

304
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,250
don't trust your local politicians so

305
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,510
you don't want them knowing what you're

306
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,950
up to and of course don't forget about

307
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,350
inflation which vanishes with Bitcoin so

308
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,360
can you see these cryptocurrencies huge

309
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,230
advantages

310
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,940
[Music]

311
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,770
and it's not only Bitcoin there's also a

312
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,170
theory Monaro Kedah no I out a triple

313
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,880
and many others in fact it's very

314
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,530
probable that in the future several

315
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,300
cryptocurrencies will coexist and what

316
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,640
we value freely by the market

317
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,840
[Music]

318
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,850
and of course some will become very

319
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,560
valuable than many others will simply

320
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,480
disappear but there's no doubt about it

321
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,700
cryptocurrencies they're here to stay

322
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,750
[Music]

323
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,639
so folks in this video we've explored

324
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,829
what money is what problems come about

325
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,509
with it and why cryptocurrencies are

326
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,370
here to stay but this is only the

327
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:35,939
beginning

328
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,110
now that we know what we're talking

329
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,759
about it's time to look at a completely

330
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,410
different future but we're gonna be

331
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,180
doing that in the next video but before

332
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,709
you go remember that while blockchain

333
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,170
might be a technological marvel and lead

334
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,790
to more secure transactions in the

335
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,680
future there are still plenty of

336
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,660
security risks on the Internet and

337
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,970
that's where today's sponsor Nord VPN

338
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,829
comes in have you have been sitting in a

339
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,170
cafe with some open Wi-Fi network and

340
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,910
wanted to check your internet banking or

341
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,560
something secure like that well don't

342
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,420
even think about it without a VPN well

343
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,129
maybe it live in one of those oppressive

344
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,629
countries we're often talking about on

345
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,459
this channel and you've got restricted

346
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,930
internet and you want to watch a fun

347

know

349
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,709
well Nord VPN will sort you out or maybe

350
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,209
more likely you just want to watch local

351
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,680
content from your own country when

352
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,810
you're abroad well nor TPN it does all

353
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,850
of this nor PPN is super fast so

354
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,920
watching video is a breeze there's no

355
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,959
lag whatsoever if you've ever used VPNs

356
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,269
and thought they were slow well no more

357
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,370
with Nord VPN and you can use it across

358

there are no logs kept at all like

360
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,860
companies based in the EU or the US nor

361
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,139
VPN is based in Panama so they don't

362
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,389
have to keep logs at all which obviously

363
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:50,399
is great for your privacy indeed they

364
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,740
