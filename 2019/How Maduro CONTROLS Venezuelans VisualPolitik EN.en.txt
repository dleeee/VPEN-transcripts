all this coupled with the United States

as recent sanctions which are frozen all

33
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,390
revenues have put the Bolivarian regime

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,210
in a very tight spot we're going to

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,030
announce sanctions against petróleos de

Venezuela Sociedad aneema or paid of asa

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,780
as it's known by its Spanish acronym the

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,670
state-owned oil monopoly give you the

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,620
scenario that Nicolas Madeira now faces

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,500
is complicated really complicated for

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,150
one thing not only has his Authority

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,470
been questioned in the global arena

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,270
opposition from the Venezuelan

44
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,610
population it's also undeniable secondly

45
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,840
the country is on the verge of

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,700
collapsing as a whole because it's about

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,310
to run out of dollars and petrol yep

48
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,930
petrol you've heard that correctly

49
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,970
Ivan's all now Venezuela has been

50
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,890
importing a significant chunk of its

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,960
petrol from the United States check this

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,590
out

[Music]

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,400
the EVs a imports 70% of the gasoline

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,470
the domestic market consumes but of

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,150
course now a virtually worthless

57
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,340
Venezuelan currency has no ability to

58
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,260
buy dollars those days they're simply

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,210
over so now the question remains can a

60
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,010
country survive without petrol and

61
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,130
without oil and the answer is I doubt it

62
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,350
and you know what Nicolas Maduro and his

63
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,840
henchmen they know this and they know

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,820
that the time might be about to run out

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,950
forever but let's consider what that

66
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,900
would mean for just a minute more

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,970
specifically let's look at these two

68
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,820
questions number one how has this Avista

69
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,530
regime now headed by Nicolas Maduro

70
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,680
survived for so long and two is a

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,110
peaceful transition possible folks the

72
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,580
answer to both of those questions

73
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,010
involves the same characters so listen

74
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,210
up

75
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:51,010
[Music]

76
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,150
the Bolivarian Gestapo now let's not

77
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,950
fool ourselves changing Venezuela is

78
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,440
going to be a very very difficult task

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,390
and this is even the case if Maduro was

80
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,310
to leave quietly the Bolivarian

81
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,960
revolution is not only plundered and

82
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,940
destroyed the Venezuelan economy it has

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,920
also created lots of networks and

84
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,410
various interests of all kinds some of

85
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,420
these networks have played a key role in

86
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,329
allowing Maduro to remain in power we're

87
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,310
talking mainly about two institutions

88
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,990
which have been essential for the

89
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,970
maintenance of the entire Chevy ster

90
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,620
regime the first is the regime's

91
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,870
formidable secret police the seven or

92
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,970
Bolivarian National Intelligence Service

93
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,250
the other is phase the Special

94
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,919
Operations force we're talking about

95
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,300
organizations that haven't hesitated to

96
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,790
kidnap imprison robbed repress and

97
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,280
eliminate political opponents and anyone

98
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,260
whom the Chevys - regime considers a

99
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,390
threat

100
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,380
these two organizations have become

101
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,780
maduras army of personal bodyguards and

102
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,580
even if there is a change of government

103
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,620
in Venezuela they would probably

104
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,060
continue operating in the shadows

105
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,070
dedicating themselves to their fields of

106
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,350
expertise robbery extortion and drug

107
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,570
trafficking how did it get to this point

108
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,790
how do these organizations work what

109
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,370
roles are they really play while all of

110
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:18,860
this it deserves a closer look but first

111
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,210
things first we do have to acknowledge

112
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,240
that this isn't new at all almost all

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,830
dictatorships have been known to use

114
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,780
armed forces to consolidate their power

115
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,790
instill fear of speaking out against the

116
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,500
government and of course to get rid of

117
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,800
their political opponents

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,629
throughout the 20th century perhaps the

119
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,009
three most well-known cases were

120
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,289
Mussolini's OVR 8 an organization that

121
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,090
kept an eye on and actively repressed

122
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,860
anti-fascism Stalin's people's

123
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,780
commissariat for internal affairs and of

124
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,780
course the Nazis is stopped Oh

125
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,250
the chief goal of these organizations

126
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,930
was not so much about maintaining

127
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,849
security upholding justice but about

128
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,009
consolidating power for their respective

129
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,539
dictatorial governments

130
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,100
well Venezuela's case isn't any

131
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,930
different seven and phase aim to protect

132

economic crisis grows these two armed

139
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,880
groups have been stepping up their

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,530
activity we need to look no further than

141

try and silence the protesters and

147
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:39,860
here's a question for you can he guess

148
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,960
how they went about it it's not so

149
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,639
difficult because it's straight out of

150
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,800
the dictatorship playbook in the first

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,539
week after Guido's Proclamation is

152
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,400

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,170

supposed objective of combating the

growing violence that the country was

161
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,330
experiencing there was a move that would

162
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,340
have horrendous results for Venezuelans

163
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,860
you see between 2015 and 2016 it's

164
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,090
estimated that there were around

165
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,670
eighteen thousand cases of arbitrary

166

their case they understand that they

181
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,590
have to get rid of elements who aren't

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,590
so you could say the phase uses

191
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,660
brutality and beer as their default

192
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,640
techniques and not only do they carry

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,470
out random acts of extreme violence

194
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,240
they've also become in many cases

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
veritable criminal groups that have

196
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,050
turned theft organized crime and

197
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:45,550
extortion into sources of income and to

198
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,470
top it off they act hands in hands with

199
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,600
the so called collectives these are para

200
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,460
police groups with many local volunteers

201
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,200
amongst their rank and they were created

202
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,510
armed and financed by the Shiv Easter

203
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,070
regime they were first formed back in

204
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,930
2002 with the idea of controlling

205
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,880
neighborhoods at the grassroots level

206
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,860
that way any Venezuelan who disagreed

207
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,570
with the regime would not only be

208
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,010
controlled by the police and the

209
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,410
intelligence services but also by some

210
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,220
of their very own neighbors controlled

211
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,980
of course terrified because folks in

212
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,230
many cases these collectives have taken

213
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,000
the law into their own hands and have

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,680
set up their own businesses which are

215
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,660
also linked to drug trafficking and

216
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,150
extortion in return face often sets up

217
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,860
its operatives within these collectives

218
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,630
and their local businesses so can you

219
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,830
think of another country where police

220
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,960
act hand in hands with criminal gangs

221
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
well let me help you out

222
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,470
think about Nicaragua and wouldn't you

223
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,270
know it well they're one of murderers

224
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,420
allies meanwhile 7li powerful Bolivarian

225
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,100
National Intelligence Service created by

226
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,890
Hugo Chavez in 2010 has not been left

227
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,580

Elsa Venus Eun incremental dinero para

232
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,090
no police are no the agents of seven a

233
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,250
symbol of repression in Venezuela are in

234
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,080
charge of the most delicate operations

235
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,730
such as arresting and persecuting

236
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,350
opponents even if these opponents

237
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,750
deputies of the National Assembly or

238
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,800
members of the Venezuelan Parliament

239
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,410
sebin has become one of the symbols of

240
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,750
state terrorism implanted in Venezuela

241
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,760
it's an organization that has developed

242
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,769
a policy of grave human rights

243
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,430
violations Martina Alvarado to this day

244
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,260
both groups operate from the shadows and

245
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,600
with total impunity for example no one

246
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,640
really knows exactly how many agents

247
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,529
work at 7:00 nor how many people have

248
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,660
actually been detained or indeed who is

249
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,880
in charge of the various departments the

250
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,589
only thing we know for sure is that 7 is

251
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,079
ruled by this man Manuel Christopher

252
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,790
Figueroa who is rumored to be under the

253
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,430
thumb of Tareq al Asami high-ranking

254
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,350
minister in maduras government and vice

255
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,180
presidents of the Economic Area a guy

256
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,279
who incidentally is considered a drug

257
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,589
trafficker by the United States we also

258
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,480
know that 7 operates with such impunity

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
that it even ignores the Bolivarian

260
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,080
courts themselves yep so let me explain

261
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,329
[Music]

262
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,829
there are numerous cases where political

263
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:18,630
prisoners were ordered to be released by

264
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,880
the Bolivarian justice system but they

265
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,160
are still in jail because seven simply

266
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,410
refuses to let them go so do view the

267
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,519
building that you see here is perhaps

268
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,740
the best proof of the real disaster the

269
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,209
Venezuela has suffered through in the

270
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,980
last few decades let me explain this

271
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,870
futuristic looking building that evokes

272
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,089
the Tower of Babel is the hello Coit a

273
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,220
construction began in 1956 and it was

274
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,020
intended to house a shopping center and

275
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,500
a luxury hotel these days it's one of

276
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:43,920
sevens

277
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,050
two main headquarters this is where they

278
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,149
have their holding cells cells which as

279
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,860
you can imagine are maintained

280
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,339
dreadfully the cells have no bathrooms

281
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,110
you aren't guaranteed medical attention

282
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,540
prisoners are almost always locked up it

283
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,459
could take weeks or months to be let out

284
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,950
for a few minutes I'll never forget that

285
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,470
the inspector who received me after my

286
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,500
arrest told me welcome to hell Viveca

287
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,660
fed an envious former candidate for the

288
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,550
National Assembly once locked up seven

289
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,020
agents charged the families of the

290
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,329
inmates for necessary items such as food

291
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,550
of course that money it goes directly

292
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,769
into the agents own pockets but let's

293
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:21,240
get back to the subject at hand do you

294
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
know the extent of what these groups

295
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,600
have done in recent years

296
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,490
[Music]

297
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,440
well according to information provided

298
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,300
by the Organization of American States

299
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,060
we could be talking about in excess of

300
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,910
8,000 executions mainly carried out by

301
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,390
these groups and that's only since 2015

302
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,800
and the data from the Venezuelan

303
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,420
violence Observatory is even worse

304
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,940
according to this organization in 2018

305
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,710
alone security forces got rid of more

306
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:57,520
than 7500 people folks said in a phase

307
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,410
they not only have been nicolas maduro

308
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,600
x' armed wing they also have been the

309
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,640
life support that's kept him in power if

310
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,650
the time for change does come then no

311
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,180
doubt going to cause quite a few

312
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,770
headaches if these groups already have

313
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,720
links with drug traffickers today it

314
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,700
wouldn't be at all unusual for this to

315
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,620
become their main activity at a later

316
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,630
date but that's something we're going to

317
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,730
talk about in another video now it's

318
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,320
your turn and here's a key question for

319
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,940
you in the interests of moving forward

320
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,950
do you think amnesty should be given to

321
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,050
the leaders involved in crimes such as

322
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,970
kidnapping plundering and destroying

323
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,920
