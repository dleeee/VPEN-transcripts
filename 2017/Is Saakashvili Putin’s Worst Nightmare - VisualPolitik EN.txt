00:00:10.44 --> 00:00:14.280
look at the career of one of the most

5
00:00:11.88 --> 00:00:16.379
surprising and controversial figures of

00:00:14.28 --> 00:00:17.970
the century their figure is mikhail

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:30.819

9
00:00:31.32 --> 00:00:35.980
wait a second you don't know him well

10
00:00:33.97 --> 00:00:38.350
imagine a person who is capable of being

11
00:00:35.98 --> 00:00:40.390
one of the best allies of Washington and

12
00:00:38.35 --> 00:00:42.700
at the same time one of the greatest

13
00:00:40.39 --> 00:00:45.160
enemies of Vladimir Putin he was

14
00:00:42.7 --> 00:00:47.050
president of one country a candidate to

15
00:00:45.16 --> 00:00:49.059
preside over another and today beat

16
00:00:47.05 --> 00:00:51.370
doesn't even have a nationality this is

17
00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:57.430
a man a politician worthy of starring in

18
00:00:51.37 --> 00:00:58.510
his very own political thriller in fact

19
00:00:57.43 --> 00:01:00.400
I would initially probably wouldn't be

20
00:00:58.51 --> 00:01:01.690
surprising to see a Netflix original

21
00:01:00.4 --> 00:01:08.560
produced about this guy

22
00:01:01.69 --> 00:01:11.140
[Music]

23
00:01:08.56 --> 00:01:15.240
well this is today's character for

24
00:01:11.14 --> 00:01:15.240
visual politic it is mikhail saakashvili

25
00:01:18.57 --> 00:01:23.950
Misha the governor

26
00:01:21.82 --> 00:01:27.130
in order to start our story we need to

27
00:01:23.95 --> 00:01:28.900
go back to May the 30th 2015

28
00:01:27.13 --> 00:01:30.970
oh that's a Petro poroshenko the

29
00:01:28.9 --> 00:01:33.040
presidents of Ukraine appointed mikhail

30
00:01:30.97 --> 00:01:36.820
saakashvili as the governor of the

31
00:01:33.04 --> 00:01:38.980
province of Edessa with this position

32
00:01:36.82 --> 00:01:41.110
Misha was given Ukrainian nationality

33
00:01:38.98 --> 00:01:43.060
however to become a Ukrainian citizen he

34
00:01:41.11 --> 00:01:45.220
had to give up citizenship from his home

35
00:01:43.06 --> 00:01:49.770
country Georgia a country he had led as

36
00:01:45.22 --> 00:01:49.770
president between 2004 and 2013

37
00:01:50.43 --> 00:01:55.360
his addition to the Ukrainian government

38
00:01:53.38 --> 00:01:57.970
was quite the treat for the media and

39
00:01:55.36 --> 00:02:00.100
well that's only logical you see at that

40
00:01:57.97 --> 00:02:02.380
time Ukraine was going through a really

41
00:02:00.1 --> 00:02:03.550
tense situation after the so called mind

42
00:02:02.38 --> 00:02:05.860
and revolution in the fall of

43
00:02:03.55 --> 00:02:07.750
pro-russian President Viktor Yanukovych

44
00:02:05.86 --> 00:02:09.910
there was almost a feeling of civil war

45
00:02:07.75 --> 00:02:12.100
in Ukraine a war between Kiev supporters

46
00:02:09.91 --> 00:02:14.050
and supporters of Moscow and a desert

47
00:02:12.1 --> 00:02:16.120
was one of the most pro-russian

48
00:02:14.05 --> 00:02:18.100
provinces so you can imagine the picture

49
00:02:16.12 --> 00:02:19.810
the phoronix president and not just any

50
00:02:18.1 --> 00:02:21.940
ex-president brought of Putin's worst

51
00:02:19.81 --> 00:02:24.370
enemies appointed as the governor of

52
00:02:21.94 --> 00:02:26.680
Odessa this event was hugely discussed

53
00:02:24.37 --> 00:02:28.660
in all the national media as well as the

54
00:02:26.68 --> 00:02:30.760
international press the president of

Ukraine who was by the way in old friend

56
00:02:30.76 --> 00:02:35.230
and fellow college students of Misha's

57
00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.390
Petro poroshenko described tamesha as

58
00:02:35.23 --> 00:02:39.430
the man who makes possible the

59
00:02:37.39 --> 00:02:40.930
impossible pretty flattering right at

60
00:02:39.43 --> 00:02:43.299
that time their friendship when it

61
00:02:40.93 --> 00:02:45.489
seemed bulletproof well the mission of

62
00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.769
the new governor was to stabilize adesso

63
00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.780
Gran's power to Kiev chase corruption

64
00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.800
and set the groundwork for the region to

65
00:02:49.78 --> 00:02:53.109
prosper

[Music]

67
00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.260
in order to carry it all out make sure

68
00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.060
brought many of his former collaborators

69
00:02:57.26 --> 00:03:00.889
from Georgia he also hired many

70
00:02:59.06 --> 00:03:02.359
Ukrainian young professionals who he

71
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.969
thought to be corruption-free

72
00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:07.129
like Julia Mary chefs Kerr and activist

73
00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:10.129
who became famous here on YouTube with

74
00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.900
the video I am a Ukrainian Misha also

75
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.879
brought him some people from Putin's

76
00:03:11.9 --> 00:03:16.189
opposition in Russia like the Russian

77
00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.969
activist Maria guider who was appointed

78
00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:22.849
vice governor notice there was a lot to

79
00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:25.170
do and it had to be done fast so well as

80
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:29.639
it was said so I was done

81
00:03:25.17 --> 00:03:29.639
[Music]

82
00:03:29.86 --> 00:03:33.700
once he took the Odessa governorship the

83
00:03:32.2 --> 00:03:36.250
new governor started a thorough

84
00:03:33.7 --> 00:03:38.500
investigation to find and punish corrupt

85
00:03:36.25 --> 00:03:39.790
public workers he changed most of the

86
00:03:38.5 --> 00:03:41.770
high-level positions in the public

87
00:03:39.79 --> 00:03:43.720
administration he simplified the process

88
00:03:41.77 --> 00:03:46.000
for creating companies and introduced

89
00:03:43.72 --> 00:03:47.950
independent controls and even liberated

90
00:03:46.0 --> 00:03:49.390
public beaches that had been illegally

91
00:03:47.95 --> 00:03:51.970
occupied so that once again

92
00:03:49.39 --> 00:03:54.310
Odessa citizens joy them and hold on a

93
00:03:51.97 --> 00:03:56.800
second here because Nisha has a strange

94
00:03:54.31 --> 00:03:59.380
work methodology and it is as effective

95
00:03:56.8 --> 00:04:01.570
as it is controversial if anything

96
00:03:59.38 --> 00:04:03.610
doesn't work properly and describes he

97
00:04:01.57 --> 00:04:05.830
just dismantle zip he fires all the

98
00:04:03.61 --> 00:04:07.720
workers and he sets it up again he did

99
00:04:05.83 --> 00:04:09.610
the same during his time in office in

100
00:04:07.72 --> 00:04:11.050
Georgia with the traffic police and he

101
00:04:09.61 --> 00:04:13.300
threatened to do it again with the

102
00:04:11.05 --> 00:04:15.160
Edessa port the largest commercial port

103
00:04:13.3 --> 00:04:18.130
in Ukraine well-known for bribes and

104
00:04:15.16 --> 00:04:19.660
payments to customs officers you need to

105
00:04:18.13 --> 00:04:21.580
fire them all we have a hundred and

106
00:04:19.66 --> 00:04:23.080
thirty new people they are young new and

107
00:04:21.58 --> 00:04:25.960
trained and the old ones are hopeless

108
00:04:23.08 --> 00:04:27.550
because in the end they were here Nyanza

109
00:04:25.96 --> 00:04:29.350
pass some of the customs officers so

110
00:04:27.55 --> 00:04:31.630
that the corruption would stop consider

111
00:04:29.35 --> 00:04:33.790
this a number of businessman noted that

112
00:04:31.63 --> 00:04:35.710
bribes at the port really had stopped in

113
00:04:33.79 --> 00:04:37.510
recent months mainly because people were

114
00:04:35.71 --> 00:04:38.919
scared of becoming the next victim of

115
00:04:37.51 --> 00:04:41.530
one of Saakashvili's public

anti-corruption tirades sean walker

117
00:04:41.53 --> 00:04:45.550
correspondent of The Guardian with all

118
00:04:43.84 --> 00:04:47.710
these changes and with the help of

119
00:04:45.55 --> 00:04:49.930
Misha's contacts Edessa started to

120
00:04:47.71 --> 00:04:51.580
receive help from the USA and since

121
00:04:49.93 --> 00:04:52.900
Misha didn't trust the police the first

122
00:04:51.58 --> 00:04:54.640
thing he did was establish an

123
00:04:52.9 --> 00:04:56.850
independent police force to fight

124
00:04:54.64 --> 00:04:56.850
corruption

125
00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.669
this was a police force that was

126
00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:04.219
organized and trained by the FBI and the

127
00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.899
California Highway Patrol so it looks

128
00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.689
like everything was going pretty good

129
00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:10.909
right well just hold on a second because

130
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.469
both Sacagawea and his team soon

131
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.749
realized that it was going to be much

132
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:16.490
much harder than they anticipated the

133
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.919
problem was that Odessa was not a

134
00:05:16.49 --> 00:05:20.659
battlefield of Kiev supporters versus

135
00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.969
pro Russians but it was a battlefield

136
00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:25.219
between the rule of law and an oligarchy

137
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.440
that has dominated Ukraine since its

138
00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:32.019
independence

[Music]

140
00:05:33.27 --> 00:05:37.620
the kingdom of oligarchs

141
00:05:37.8 --> 00:05:42.180
more and more experts of says so

142
00:05:39.81 --> 00:05:44.340
Ukraine's biggest problem is not Russia

143
00:05:42.18 --> 00:05:46.650
it is their oligarchy corruption in

144
00:05:44.34 --> 00:05:48.479
Ukraine is so embedded that we could

145
00:05:46.65 --> 00:05:50.759
almost say it is a sort of feudal

146
00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:56.849
country where the nobility bar of course

147
00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:58.650
these mighty oligarchs they control the

148
00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.810
companies the political power the

00:05:58.65 --> 00:06:02.819
administration even the media almost

150
00:06:00.81 --> 00:06:05.879
nothing escapes their power which is

151
00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.770
consolidated both by money and by fear

152
00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.659
their level of impunity is almost

absolute police government judges

154
00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.930
they're all a part of the game

155
00:06:11.49 --> 00:06:14.639
things have been this way since Ukraine

156
00:06:12.93 --> 00:06:16.650
got its independence but since the

157
00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.280
Maidan revolution it's all got a whole

158
00:06:16.65 --> 00:06:22.020
lot worse after the fall of the

159
00:06:20.28 --> 00:06:24.300
pro-russian President Viktor Yanukovych

160
00:06:22.02 --> 00:06:25.830
and with the civil conflicts the country

161
00:06:24.3 --> 00:06:28.319
was going through the new government

162
00:06:25.83 --> 00:06:30.599
felt incapable of trusting the army or

163
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.550
the police since both institutions were

164
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.469
corrupted were disorganized they were

165
00:06:32.55 --> 00:06:36.780
badly equipped that is why he made a

166
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.099
decision he appointed several oligarchs

167
00:06:36.78 --> 00:06:40.409
as governors of some of the most

168
00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.150
vulnerable regions in the country these

169
00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.370
oligarchs paid for their own private

170
00:06:42.15 --> 00:06:46.110
armies and with nice incentives the

171
00:06:44.37 --> 00:06:48.180
police followed their orders as well

172
00:06:46.11 --> 00:06:50.370
earning a sum for the head of every

173
00:06:48.18 --> 00:06:51.900
separatist yeah as I told you the

174
00:06:50.37 --> 00:06:53.130
government essentially placed the Mafia

175
00:06:51.9 --> 00:06:54.840
directly in charge of several

176
00:06:53.13 --> 00:06:56.400
governorships well that was the case for

177
00:06:54.84 --> 00:06:58.529
igor kolomoisky who was appointed

178
00:06:56.4 --> 00:07:00.180
governor of denis poplin troske i'm

179
00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.460
sorry if i'm screwing the pronunciation

180
00:07:00.18 --> 00:07:03.960
up on that this took like 17 takes this

181
00:07:02.46 --> 00:07:05.909
region is one of the most important in

182
00:07:03.96 --> 00:07:08.490
the country economically speaking so yes

183
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:11.370
this is the Ukraine mikhail saakashvili

184
00:07:08.49 --> 00:07:13.529
was dealing with there is not a single

185
00:07:11.37 --> 00:07:15.690
state enterprise in Ukraine that has not

186
00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.180
been usurped by one clan or another a

187
00:07:15.69 --> 00:07:20.430
varus Abramovich former Minister of

188
00:07:18.18 --> 00:07:22.289
Economy and trade of Ukraine as you can

189
00:07:20.43 --> 00:07:24.990
imagine all these oligarchs did not

190
00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:26.819
welcome me sure or his reform agenda

191
00:07:24.99 --> 00:07:28.529
indeed once he was even kicked out of an

192
00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.060
interview when he suggested all of these

193
00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.430
mafia members had to be sent to prison

194
00:07:30.06 --> 00:07:34.380
remember that the media is also the

195
00:07:32.43 --> 00:07:37.110
property of the oligarchy the thing is

196
00:07:34.38 --> 00:07:40.080
Misha soon started to work to fight and

197
00:07:37.11 --> 00:07:45.449
ultimately ends the situation

198
00:07:40.08 --> 00:07:47.610
I will do whatever it takes for complete

199
00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.830
victory to read Ukraine of this filth of

200
00:07:47.61 --> 00:07:51.960
this corrupt scum which capitalized on

201
00:07:49.83 --> 00:07:53.699
the blood of our soldiers whose only

202
00:07:51.96 --> 00:07:55.830
motivation in life is to fill its own

203
00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.409
pockets strengthen its own clan and

204
00:07:55.83 --> 00:08:01.409
bleed Ukraine dry Mikhail Saakashvili

205
00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:03.389
and so he did Mischa started to publicly

206
00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:05.669
report all kinds of influence peddling

207
00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:07.560
favorable treatment and privileges on

208
00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.360
one occasion he even came on national

209
00:08:07.56 --> 00:08:11.069
television and reported the details of a

210
00:08:09.36 --> 00:08:13.289
corrupt scheme of the airlines

211
00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:15.090
owned by kolomoiskiy an oligarch who

212
00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:16.949
nearly obtained a monopoly on national

213
00:08:15.09 --> 00:08:18.419
flights the public report ended the

214
00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:20.159
situation and took many of the people

215
00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:21.690
involved to course but as you can

216
00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:24.000
imagine mr. kolomoisky

217
00:08:21.69 --> 00:08:25.469
didn't take it well he promised to get

218
00:08:24.0 --> 00:08:28.259
his revenge and here's what he said

219
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:30.060
about Saakashvili in public when a dog

220
00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:32.339
without a muzzle bite someone we need to

221
00:08:30.06 --> 00:08:34.409
punish both the dog and more importantly

222
00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:35.849
the owner Igor kolomoisky

223
00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:39.169
now do you know think that only she did

224
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:42.140
was recalled the oligarchs not at all

225
00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:47.930
[Music]

226
00:08:42.14 --> 00:08:50.209
the train crash saakashvili's reforms in

227
00:08:47.93 --> 00:08:52.310
Edessa didn't completely work many of

228
00:08:50.209 --> 00:08:54.350
them were stopped and sabotaged by the

229
00:08:52.31 --> 00:08:56.269
government in Kiev this wasn't just the

230
00:08:54.35 --> 00:08:57.860
oligarchs you see corruption was so

231
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.630
commonplace that it was difficult to

232
00:08:57.86 --> 00:09:05.839
tell the difference between the Mafia

233
00:08:59.63 --> 00:09:08.480
and the authorities Misha he didn't

234
00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:11.060
think twice the government became his

235
00:09:08.48 --> 00:09:12.649
target many analysts claim that this new

236
00:09:11.06 --> 00:09:15.380
war against the government had a hidden

237
00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:17.870
agenda to take a leap international

238
00:09:15.38 --> 00:09:19.550
politics well maybe but the thing is he

239
00:09:17.87 --> 00:09:21.140
did it he started by reporting the

240
00:09:19.55 --> 00:09:23.360
corruption of the very prime minister

241
00:09:21.14 --> 00:09:24.890
arseniy yatsenyuk men's many ministers

242
00:09:23.36 --> 00:09:26.320
followed this even included his own

243
00:09:24.89 --> 00:09:28.930
friends the president's Petro poroshenko

244
00:09:26.32 --> 00:09:31.610
the person who had placed him in Edessa

245
00:09:28.93 --> 00:09:33.079
what difference for Ukrainians does it

246
00:09:31.61 --> 00:09:35.300
make who will treat them like dirt

247
00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:36.649
poroshenko or you Cunha bitch what

248
00:09:35.3 --> 00:09:38.930
difference who will steal from them

249
00:09:36.649 --> 00:09:40.279
Mikhail Saakashvili the friendship it

250
00:09:38.93 --> 00:09:42.410
didn't last long as we have seen

251
00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:45.680
poroshenko appointed Misha governor in

252
00:09:42.41 --> 00:09:48.040
May of 2015 in just a year the battle

253
00:09:45.68 --> 00:09:48.040
had begun

254
00:09:48.23 --> 00:09:53.300
finally in November 2016 misha resigned

255
00:09:51.53 --> 00:09:56.900
as governor and began his own political

256
00:09:53.3 --> 00:09:59.780
party the mnf and he soon gains more

257
00:09:56.9 --> 00:10:01.850
than 20,000 members yep the former

258
00:09:59.78 --> 00:10:03.890
Georgian presidents now wanted to lead

259
00:10:01.85 --> 00:10:05.930
Ukraine in his own words he aspired to

260
00:10:03.89 --> 00:10:11.870
turn this disaster of a country into a

261
00:10:05.93 --> 00:10:13.430
complete European superpower the Emine

262
00:10:11.87 --> 00:10:15.230
are we wondering about the response of

263
00:10:13.43 --> 00:10:17.360
poroshenko and the government to this

264
00:10:15.23 --> 00:10:19.670
campaign and paid close attention here

265
00:10:17.36 --> 00:10:21.470
in July 2017

266
00:10:19.67 --> 00:10:24.260
poroshenko took advantage of the fact

267
00:10:21.47 --> 00:10:25.910
that Misha was in the USA and he revoked

268
00:10:24.26 --> 00:10:28.160
his Ukrainian citizenship

269
00:10:25.91 --> 00:10:29.870
all of a sudden mikhail saakashvili was

270
00:10:28.16 --> 00:10:31.580
a stateless person

271
00:10:29.87 --> 00:10:34.100
now if you think that stopped him you

272
00:10:31.58 --> 00:10:36.320
are absolutely wrong look when his

273
00:10:34.1 --> 00:10:37.850
nationality was taken away Misha he

274
00:10:36.32 --> 00:10:39.860
simply moved to Poland and we have to

275
00:10:37.85 --> 00:10:41.750
say Misha's a well-loved guy in Eastern

276
00:10:39.86 --> 00:10:44.210
Europe in fact many countries offered

277
00:10:41.75 --> 00:10:46.550
him citizenship but no bishop he was

278
00:10:44.21 --> 00:10:48.350
determined to go back to Ukraine and

279
00:10:46.55 --> 00:10:49.880
well that's exactly what he did

280
00:10:48.35 --> 00:10:51.920
despite the warnings of the government

281
00:10:49.88 --> 00:10:54.020
in Kiev on September the 10th surrounded

282
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:56.090
by a supportive crowd Misha crossed the

283
00:10:54.02 --> 00:10:58.430
border on foot between Poland and

284
00:10:56.09 --> 00:11:00.050
Ukraine the images of his confrontation

285
00:10:58.43 --> 00:11:00.770
with the border guards well they're

286
00:11:00.05 --> 00:11:11.510
quite a sight

287
00:11:00.77 --> 00:11:15.190
[Music]

288
00:11:11.51 --> 00:11:15.190
[Applause]

289
00:11:19.4 --> 00:11:23.150
and so what do you think he's up to now

290
00:11:21.44 --> 00:11:25.490
that he's back despite his irregular

291
00:11:23.15 --> 00:11:27.080
situation Misha he's campaigning around

292
00:11:25.49 --> 00:11:29.540
the country but all of that said there

293
00:11:27.08 --> 00:11:32.950
is still an important question why

294
00:11:29.54 --> 00:11:32.950
Mikhail Saakashvili

295
00:11:33.46 --> 00:11:40.760
[Music]

296
00:11:34.96 --> 00:11:42.470
the Saakashvili Revolution in 2003 misha

297
00:11:40.76 --> 00:11:44.300
led a popular uprising against the

298
00:11:42.47 --> 00:11:46.430
corrupt georgian political system of

299
00:11:44.3 --> 00:11:48.200
eduard shevardnadze and in what is known

300
00:11:46.43 --> 00:11:49.940
as the Rose Revolution he even made it

301
00:11:48.2 --> 00:11:51.740
to the Georgian Parliament elections

302
00:11:49.94 --> 00:11:54.020
were held man's as these successful

303
00:11:51.74 --> 00:11:57.589
revolutions leader Saakashvili easily

304
00:11:54.02 --> 00:11:58.940
beat the rest the reform process started

305
00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:00.860
there was a fierce fight against

306
00:11:58.94 --> 00:12:02.660
corruption and a tough policy towards

307
00:12:00.86 --> 00:12:06.589
Moscow that came to be a model for the

308
00:12:02.66 --> 00:12:08.390
former Soviet countries but we are going

309
00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:10.550
