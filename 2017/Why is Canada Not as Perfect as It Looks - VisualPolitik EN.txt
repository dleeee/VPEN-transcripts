3
00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.940
on the first of July this year Canada

4
00:00:09.9 --> 00:00:13.950
celebrated its one hundred and fiftieth

5
00:00:11.94 --> 00:00:15.630
birthday now we told you all about this

6
00:00:13.95 --> 00:00:17.820
in a previous video where we also showed

7
00:00:15.63 --> 00:00:20.130
you some of the keys as to why Canada is

8
00:00:17.82 --> 00:00:22.350
one of the most admired countries in the

9
00:00:20.13 --> 00:00:24.779
entire world Canada it's divided into

10
00:00:22.35 --> 00:00:26.820
ten provinces and 3 territories that

11
00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.369
have so many unique regulations that in

12
00:00:26.82 --> 00:00:31.650
2017 they actually had to sign a free

13
00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690
trade agreement among them however even

14
00:00:31.65 --> 00:00:36.149
though this country has turned 150 in

15
00:00:33.69 --> 00:00:38.280
perfect shape Canada is also facing

16
00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.809
problems they face social political and

17
00:00:38.28 --> 00:00:42.360
economic threats that could be

18
00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.340
considered well pretty serious indeed

19
00:00:42.36 --> 00:00:47.489
because as you probably already know

20
00:00:44.34 --> 00:00:49.289
well unfortunately nothing is perfect so

21
00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.730
in a previous video whose link I'll

22
00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.039
leave at the end of this video as well

23
00:00:50.73 --> 00:00:55.110
as in the description below we looked on

24
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.969
the bright side of things and Canada

25
00:00:55.11 --> 00:00:59.370
ended up looking pretty darn wonderful

26
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.199
but in this video we're going to discuss

27
00:00:59.37 --> 00:01:03.539
the main problems and threats that are

28
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.760
affecting Canada and well the first of

29
00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.260
them it's got a lot to do with this one

30
00:01:05.76 --> 00:01:09.260
hundred and fiftieth anniversary

31
00:01:11.26 --> 00:01:20.230
a birthday somehow artificial not all

32
00:01:18.49 --> 00:01:21.850
Canadians not even close

33
00:01:20.23 --> 00:01:23.530
celebrated this one hundred and fiftieth

34
00:01:21.85 --> 00:01:26.020
birthday we can find several different

35
00:01:23.53 --> 00:01:27.700
reasons why but in order to explain them

36
00:01:26.02 --> 00:01:31.630
we should first tell you about what

37
00:01:27.7 --> 00:01:35.470
happens 150 years ago so let's jump back

38
00:01:31.63 --> 00:01:37.600
in time all the way to 1867 on the 1st

39
00:01:35.47 --> 00:01:39.880
of july of that year the territory was

40
00:01:37.6 --> 00:01:41.710
still a part of the british empire but

41
00:01:39.88 --> 00:01:46.000
it was on this day that the first

42
00:01:41.71 --> 00:01:48.760
British North America Act was signed the

43
00:01:46.0 --> 00:01:50.830
British North America Act of 1867 was a

44
00:01:48.76 --> 00:01:52.870
law that United the three colonial

45
00:01:50.83 --> 00:01:55.240
provinces of New Brunswick New Scotland

46
00:01:52.87 --> 00:01:57.430
and Canada which was divided up into

47
00:01:55.24 --> 00:02:01.930
Ontario and Quebec that very same day

48
00:01:57.43 --> 00:02:03.820
into the Confederation of Canada on top

49
00:02:01.93 --> 00:02:05.530
of these four provinces which still kept

50
00:02:03.82 --> 00:02:07.450
quite a lot of autonomy a federal

51
00:02:05.53 --> 00:02:10.209
government was organized to give them

52
00:02:07.45 --> 00:02:13.860
some cohesion above this governments

53
00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.260
there was still the British authorities

54
00:02:13.86 --> 00:02:19.120
in fact to this day Canada is still the

55
00:02:17.26 --> 00:02:21.459
monarchy and Queen Elizabeth the second

56
00:02:19.12 --> 00:02:22.660
is still the head of state also and

57
00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.730
although it might sound surprising

58
00:02:22.66 --> 00:02:27.970
Canada didn't have total independence

59
00:02:24.73 --> 00:02:30.220
from the UK until very recently 1982 in

60
00:02:27.97 --> 00:02:32.320
fact that was right up until 1982 any

61
00:02:30.22 --> 00:02:35.640
constitutional modification requires the

62
00:02:32.32 --> 00:02:37.680
approval of the British Parliament

63
00:02:35.64 --> 00:02:40.080
so as you can probably see from this

64
00:02:37.68 --> 00:02:42.720
that lore in 1867 didn't result in a

65
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:45.090
completely independent country but dear

66
00:02:42.72 --> 00:02:47.940
viewers I that's not the end of it there

67
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:50.520
are more reasons why Canadians dislike

68
00:02:47.94 --> 00:02:52.620
this day the most important of these is

69
00:02:50.52 --> 00:02:56.930
that when the settlers arrived Canada

70
00:02:52.62 --> 00:02:56.930
well it wasn't an empty land

71
00:02:59.03 --> 00:03:03.330
[Music]

72
00:03:00.35 --> 00:03:04.010
the First Nations the Inuits and the

73
00:03:03.33 --> 00:03:06.230
Metis

74
00:03:04.01 --> 00:03:08.840
[Applause]

75
00:03:06.23 --> 00:03:11.030
around 1.5 million inhabitants said

76
00:03:08.84 --> 00:03:13.040
nothing to celebrate last July and those

77
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:15.800
inhabitants well they were the natives

78
00:03:13.04 --> 00:03:18.470
of Canada it's a celebration of the

79
00:03:15.8 --> 00:03:21.739
worst 150 years of indigenous peoples

80
00:03:18.47 --> 00:03:23.540
lives but don't think of this as only a

81
00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.040
historical problem the recognition and

82
00:03:23.54 --> 00:03:27.440
integration of these peoples it

83
00:03:25.04 --> 00:03:29.420
continues to this day to be a national

84
00:03:27.44 --> 00:03:31.250
problem in fact the governments of

85
00:03:29.42 --> 00:03:33.049
Justin Trudeau has made it a priority

86
00:03:31.25 --> 00:03:35.599
consider what the Prime Minister had to

87
00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.910
say on the 21st of June over this yeah

88
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.530
no relationship is more important to

89
00:03:37.91 --> 00:03:41.930
Canada than the relationship with the

90
00:03:39.53 --> 00:03:44.180
indigenous peoples Justin Trudeau but

91
00:03:41.93 --> 00:03:45.920
now you might be wondering who are these

92
00:03:44.18 --> 00:03:53.720
groups and what has happened to them

93
00:03:45.92 --> 00:03:55.310
over the last 150 years according to the

94
00:03:53.72 --> 00:03:57.620
Canadian Constitution there are three

95
00:03:55.31 --> 00:04:00.620
large groups the first nations made of

96
00:03:57.62 --> 00:04:02.810
more than 600 Native communities the

97
00:04:00.62 --> 00:04:05.209
Inuits the people of the Arctic and the

98
00:04:02.81 --> 00:04:07.740
met eats the result of mixing natives

99
00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.930
with the new settlers

100
00:04:07.74 --> 00:04:11.820
so Canada was not an empty land when the

101
00:04:09.93 --> 00:04:13.650
settlers arrived it's actually estimated

102
00:04:11.82 --> 00:04:15.870
that there were around 500,000 people

103
00:04:13.65 --> 00:04:17.760
from these Native communities who signed

104
00:04:15.87 --> 00:04:19.260
agreements with the British and the

105
00:04:17.76 --> 00:04:20.880
French authorities they even

106
00:04:19.26 --> 00:04:22.830
participated in the battles that

107
00:04:20.88 --> 00:04:25.260
protected the independence of Canada

108
00:04:22.83 --> 00:04:27.450
Canada would be American today if not

109
00:04:25.26 --> 00:04:28.710
for the Indian allies who fought for the

110
00:04:27.45 --> 00:04:30.960
crown Peter Russell

111
00:04:28.71 --> 00:04:33.240
oh yes the US really did try to invade

112
00:04:30.96 --> 00:04:34.650
Canada more than once well the problem

113
00:04:33.24 --> 00:04:36.150
is that despite being the first people

114
00:04:34.65 --> 00:04:38.280
in this land and despite the fact that

115
00:04:36.15 --> 00:04:40.350
they participated and contributed to the

116
00:04:38.28 --> 00:04:45.170
independence of the country the natives

117
00:04:40.35 --> 00:04:45.170
suffered clear cultural persecution

118
00:04:47.77 --> 00:04:52.569
yep as a result of that obsession some

119
00:04:50.68 --> 00:04:54.370
how to create homogeneous national

120
00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.009
identities Canada went through a period

121
00:04:54.37 --> 00:04:58.750
of persecuting the natives for years

122
00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.400
these people suffered the occupation of

123
00:04:58.75 --> 00:05:02.410
their territories and were sent away to

124
00:05:00.4 --> 00:05:04.389
reservations which sometimes didn't even

125
00:05:02.41 --> 00:05:06.190
have the basic conditions that would

126
00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.750
allow for their survival furthermore

127
00:05:06.19 --> 00:05:09.610
both their language and their cultural

128
00:05:07.75 --> 00:05:11.620
and religious rituals were sometimes

129
00:05:09.61 --> 00:05:13.690
forbidden this persecution it reached

130
00:05:11.62 --> 00:05:15.580
such a point that the authorities set up

131
00:05:13.69 --> 00:05:17.800
a system of residences and boarding

132
00:05:15.58 --> 00:05:19.150
schools for the children of native

133
00:05:17.8 --> 00:05:21.250
families the government took the

134
00:05:19.15 --> 00:05:22.750
children from the families and sent them

135
00:05:21.25 --> 00:05:25.150
to schools where they would receive an

136
00:05:22.75 --> 00:05:26.979
education which was fully Western so

137
00:05:25.15 --> 00:05:29.020
that they could lose all aspects of

138
00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.210
their cultural identity tens of

139
00:05:29.02 --> 00:05:32.210
thousands of children they were educated

140
00:05:31.21 --> 00:05:34.530
in this way

141
00:05:32.21 --> 00:05:36.940
[Music]

142
00:05:34.53 --> 00:05:39.160
[Applause]

143
00:05:36.94 --> 00:05:40.420
and these schools they continued until

144
00:05:39.16 --> 00:05:42.520
the 1970s

145
00:05:40.42 --> 00:05:44.320
and the consequences they still have to

146
00:05:42.52 --> 00:05:45.610
be dealt with today poverty rates much

147
00:05:44.32 --> 00:05:47.530
higher than average there are many

148
00:05:45.61 --> 00:05:49.780
broken families depression is rampant

149
00:05:47.53 --> 00:05:51.120
and alcoholism and suicide rates are

150
00:05:49.78 --> 00:05:53.850
higher than average

151
00:05:51.12 --> 00:05:55.480
[Applause]

152
00:05:53.85 --> 00:05:57.400
[Music]

153
00:05:55.48 --> 00:05:59.949
[Applause]

154
00:05:57.4 --> 00:06:02.080
these are the consequences of this sort

155
00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:07.960
of persecution along with these racism

156
00:06:02.08 --> 00:06:09.789
and exclusion were also very normal so

157
00:06:07.96 --> 00:06:11.590
in 2008 the prime minister at the time

158
00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.210
Stephen Hoffa apologized to these

159
00:06:11.59 --> 00:06:15.300
peoples for the atrocities and

160
00:06:13.21 --> 00:06:16.509
established the Truth and Reconciliation

161
00:06:15.3 --> 00:06:18.520
Commission

162
00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:21.910
Mr Speaker I stand before you today to

163
00:06:18.52 --> 00:06:24.880
offer an apology to former students of

164
00:06:21.91 --> 00:06:26.530
Indian Residential schools the treatment

165
00:06:24.88 --> 00:06:30.370
of children in Indian Residential

166
00:06:26.53 --> 00:06:32.380
schools is a sad chapter in our history

167
00:06:30.37 --> 00:06:34.570
they've also paid hundreds of millions

168
00:06:32.38 --> 00:06:36.789
of dollars in reparations that money

169
00:06:34.57 --> 00:06:38.710
can't fix all these problems even today

170
00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.690
Canada is still looking for the best way

171
00:06:38.71 --> 00:06:42.370
to move forward from this dark period of

172
00:06:40.69 --> 00:06:44.199
its history but now let's step back

173
00:06:42.37 --> 00:06:45.880
forward to the present day and look at

174
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:48.340
the relationship between Canada and the

175
00:06:45.88 --> 00:06:57.279
US oh well more absolutely Canada and

176
00:06:48.34 --> 00:06:59.469
president from the break-up threat

177
00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.449
Canada is very dependent on its

178
00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.829
relationship with the United States they

179
00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.659
are so dependent that we could almost

180
00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:06.819
say that the Canadians would be unable

181
00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:10.059
to live without their southern neighbor

182
00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:12.729
indeed almost 70% of Canadian trade is

183
00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:14.769
bound for the United States further the

184
00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.139
industrial sector of both countries it's

185
00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:19.029
strongly interconnected so this is a

186
00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.759
special relationship and this is

187
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:23.799
something Justin Trudeau knows indeed he

188
00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.749
said so in his campaign and as soon as

189
00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:27.489
he reached power Lee concentrated his

190
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.919
international affairs into improving

191
00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:31.689
Canada's relationship with the United

192
00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:32.860
States and truth be told the

193
00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:35.909
relationship that he built with the

194
00:07:32.86 --> 00:07:35.909
bomber there was great

195
00:07:38.5 --> 00:07:44.950
so thank you again for your leadership

196
00:07:41.16 --> 00:07:47.830
and your friendship I know that our two

197
00:07:44.95 --> 00:07:50.350
countries can achieve great things by

198
00:07:47.83 --> 00:07:53.020
working together as allies and as

199
00:07:50.35 --> 00:08:00.430
friends as we have done so many times

200
00:07:53.02 --> 00:08:05.160
before some things we will probably

201
00:08:00.43 --> 00:08:08.560
never agree on whose beer is better

202
00:08:05.16 --> 00:08:10.800
who's better at hockey

203
00:08:08.56 --> 00:08:14.020
[Music]

204
00:08:10.8 --> 00:08:17.230
but now Trump's in office and is suing a

205
00:08:14.02 --> 00:08:19.060
policy of protectionism Canada what

206
00:08:17.23 --> 00:08:22.660
they've done to our dairy farm workers

207
00:08:19.06 --> 00:08:24.730
is the disgrace it's a disgrace and so

208
00:08:22.66 --> 00:08:26.770
what did the Canadian government do well

209
00:08:24.73 --> 00:08:28.870
they set up something of a war room this

210
00:08:26.77 --> 00:08:30.880
was an office dedicated to following all

211
00:08:28.87 --> 00:08:32.830
the movements of the new administration

212
00:08:30.88 --> 00:08:34.630
in Washington at first these strategy of

213
00:08:32.83 --> 00:08:36.190
Trudeau and his people was buttering up

214
00:08:34.63 --> 00:08:37.810
the American government and it kind of

215
00:08:36.19 --> 00:08:39.340
looked like it was working the Canadian

216
00:08:37.81 --> 00:08:41.110
Prime Minister even started a friendship

217
00:08:39.34 --> 00:08:43.750
with Ivanka Trump Trump's daughter

218
00:08:41.11 --> 00:08:46.390
Justin Trudeau brings Ivanka Trump to

219
00:08:43.75 --> 00:08:48.370
Broadway show on welcoming Outsiders as

220
00:08:46.39 --> 00:08:51.190
you can imagine this opened the door to

221
00:08:48.37 --> 00:08:53.230
all sorts of wild rumors and speculation

222
00:08:51.19 --> 00:08:55.210
the thing is they got on well and both

223
00:08:53.23 --> 00:08:57.100
led a seminar on women in business that

224
00:08:55.21 --> 00:09:00.100
Donald Trump himself mentioned in a

225
00:08:57.1 --> 00:09:01.960
speech to Congress the help of Prime

226
00:09:00.1 --> 00:09:03.700
Minister Justin Trudeau we have formed a

227
00:09:01.96 --> 00:09:05.410
council with our neighbors in Canada to

228
00:09:03.7 --> 00:09:07.630
help ensure that women entrepreneurs

229
00:09:05.41 --> 00:09:09.100
have access to the networks markets and

230
00:09:07.63 --> 00:09:11.790
capital they need to start a business

231
00:09:09.1 --> 00:09:13.990
and live out their financial dreams

232
00:09:11.79 --> 00:09:15.580
Donald Trump all right so this was all

233
00:09:13.99 --> 00:09:18.580
great it seemed to be working really

234
00:09:15.58 --> 00:09:20.500
well buds then all of a sudden Trump

235
00:09:18.58 --> 00:09:22.770
attacked and accused Canada rather

236
00:09:20.5 --> 00:09:27.420
unexpectedly of unfair competition

237
00:09:22.77 --> 00:09:27.420
something that he also did with Mexico

238
00:09:27.69 --> 00:09:31.690
it would be really dangerous for Canada

239
00:09:30.22 --> 00:09:33.370
to suffer a restriction on trade

240
00:09:31.69 --> 00:09:35.110
relations with the US so the

241
00:09:33.37 --> 00:09:37.180
government's in Ottawa decided to start

242
00:09:35.11 --> 00:09:38.800
the so-called doughnut strategy

243
00:09:37.18 --> 00:09:40.570
consisting of influencing all

244
00:09:38.8 --> 00:09:42.430
institutions around the White House

245
00:09:40.57 --> 00:09:45.440
which would be considered as being in

246
00:09:42.43 --> 00:09:47.600
the center that whole of the day

247
00:09:45.44 --> 00:09:49.940
but the question it now becomes will

248
00:09:47.6 --> 00:09:51.110
they achieve their goal only time will

249
00:09:49.94 --> 00:09:53.600
say the first challenge is to

250
00:09:51.11 --> 00:09:55.100
renegotiate NAFTA as Trump has demands

251
00:09:53.6 --> 00:09:56.750
it now next up we need to consider

252
00:09:55.1 --> 00:10:02.330
another potential crisis that could

253
00:09:56.75 --> 00:10:06.320
threaten Canadian prosperity the real

254
00:10:02.33 --> 00:10:07.820
estate bubble the prices in Canada's

255
00:10:06.32 --> 00:10:11.180
housing market they have absolutely

256
00:10:07.82 --> 00:10:12.770
skyrocketed they've increased 76 percent

257
00:10:11.18 --> 00:10:15.050
and so if the loans that banks are

258
00:10:12.77 --> 00:10:17.630
providing indeed family debt in Canada

259
00:10:15.05 --> 00:10:19.670
is now among the highest in the world

260
00:10:17.63 --> 00:10:23.260
have a look at this chart do you see the

261
00:10:19.67 --> 00:10:23.260
increase in Canadian real estate prices

262
00:10:23.32 --> 00:10:28.030
and then we've got to consider family

263
00:10:26.6 --> 00:10:31.410
debt

264
00:10:28.03 --> 00:10:33.509
[Music]

265
00:10:31.41 --> 00:10:35.579
but as you might imagine this is set off

266
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:37.680
all sorts of economic alarms many

267
00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:39.810
analysts foresee the popping of the

268
00:10:37.68 --> 00:10:41.519
Canadian real estate bubble along with

269
00:10:39.81 --> 00:10:43.860
all the consequences that that would

270
00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.180
have on its economy and look almost 7

271
00:10:43.86 --> 00:10:47.069
percent of the country's employments

272
00:10:45.18 --> 00:10:48.779
belongs to the construction sector and

273
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:51.060
thanks to this mortgage boom three

274
00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:53.550
Canadian banks are now in the top 20

275
00:10:51.06 --> 00:10:55.050
banks worldwide in fact the market value

276
00:10:53.55 --> 00:10:59.879
of the Royal Bank of Canada is higher

277
00:10:55.05 --> 00:11:01.860
than that of any bank in the eurozone as

278
00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:03.449
everyone knows the consequences of the

279
00:11:01.86 --> 00:11:05.399
real estate bubble bursting would be

280
00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:07.500
pretty dire so doing something about

281
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:09.300
this has become another priority of the

282
00:11:07.5 --> 00:11:10.980
Canadian government the government's

283
00:11:09.3 --> 00:11:12.779
it's trying to stimulate other sectors

284
00:11:10.98 --> 00:11:14.939
while cooling down the real estate

285
00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:16.680
market maybe the intention to increase

286
00:11:14.939 --> 00:11:18.569
the arrival of immigrants by 50 percent

287
00:11:16.68 --> 00:11:20.850
every year has a lot to do with this

288
00:11:18.569 --> 00:11:22.470
more immigrants means more demand for

289
00:11:20.85 --> 00:11:23.699
real estate but other experts they

290
00:11:22.47 --> 00:11:25.910
disagree with this and state the

291
00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:28.649
Canadian banks were not affected by the

292
00:11:25.91 --> 00:11:30.779
2008 crisis and that they are quite a

293
00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:32.879
bit more solid than other international

294
00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:34.560
banks and also the economy in Canada

295
00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:36.240
it's doing quite well and is gaining

296
00:11:34.56 --> 00:11:38.930
strength after some pretty mediocre

297
00:11:36.24 --> 00:11:38.930
years

298
00:11:41.44 --> 00:11:45.009
anyway time will tell but this is a risk

299
00:11:43.66 --> 00:11:47.110
that the government is going to have to

300
00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:53.500
look out for all right so now let's move

301
00:11:47.11 --> 00:11:56.370
on to the matter of public services the

302
00:11:53.5 --> 00:11:56.370
waiting lists

303
00:11:56.49 --> 00:12:00.300
in Canada health is a public service

304
00:11:58.56 --> 00:12:02.430
which is managed and financed by the

305
00:12:00.3 --> 00:12:03.930
governments with the citizens taxes of

306
00:12:02.43 --> 00:12:05.370
course the system is considered to be

307
00:12:03.93 --> 00:12:07.050
one of the best in the world

308
00:12:05.37 --> 00:12:09.540
however they have recently had to deal

309
00:12:07.05 --> 00:12:11.490
with some very serious problems most

310
00:12:09.54 --> 00:12:13.920
important of all of these problems is

311
00:12:11.49 --> 00:12:15.600
the issue of waiting lists according to

312
00:12:13.92 --> 00:12:18.630
the Fraser Institute the average time to

313
00:12:15.6 --> 00:12:20.910
see a specialist is 18 weeks that's more

314
00:12:18.63 --> 00:12:22.620
than four months and the demographic of

315
00:12:20.91 --> 00:12:24.089
the aging population and the increase of

316
00:12:22.62 --> 00:12:27.630
life expectancy has made it difficult

317
00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:29.580
for the system to cope this is all

318
00:12:27.63 --> 00:12:31.350
resulted in tens of thousands of

319
00:12:29.58 --> 00:12:33.480
Canadians of moving to the u.s. to

320
00:12:31.35 --> 00:12:35.100
receive medical attention and lately it

321
00:12:33.48 --> 00:12:39.630
is even popular to take our medical

322
00:12:35.1 --> 00:12:41.399
insurance in the United States anyway

323
00:12:39.63 --> 00:12:43.020
these are the main challenges and

324
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:44.940
threats to the governments of Justin

325
00:12:43.02 --> 00:12:46.709
Trudeau like we said earlier not

326
00:12:44.94 --> 00:12:49.589
everything and these sunshine lollipops

327
00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:51.360
and rainbows but you know what we think

328
00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:53.339
that the overall result of the Canadian

329
00:12:51.36 --> 00:12:55.860
cocktail well we think it looks pretty

330
00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:57.930
good so now it's your turn what do you

331
00:12:55.86 --> 00:12:59.730
think of Canada and their systems do let
