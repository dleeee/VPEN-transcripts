00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,979
Arak I'm sure many of you automatically

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,470
associate this word this name with a

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,569
destroyed country that's ravaged by war

4
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,670
a place with no hope or future a place

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,400
where religious extremism runs wild and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,780
there are endless conflicts between

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,949
Sunnis and Shiites and you know what

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,289
you'd be absolutely right this has been

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,269
Iraq's reality for the last few decades

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,340
especially following the first Gulf War

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,130
the US invasion and the emergence of the

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,439
Islamic state the terrorist group which

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,270
ended up occupying a large part of the

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,399
country we're talking about a place that

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,440
is a factory for bad news without

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,750
delving too deep in the last few months

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,820
strong social revolts have caused a lot

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,430
of tension the Iraqis are unhappy and

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,600
for good reason RAK at least 42 dead and

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,640
2,000 injured in anti-government

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,329
protests Iraq protests capital Baghdad

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,520
blocked as unrest escalates

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
[Music]

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,309
however this time we're not going to

25
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:07,070
talk about a destroyed Iraq or disasters

26
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,530
or about victims or indeed about

27
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,390
misfortune if you're a regular viewer of

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,980
this channel you've probably realized by

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,540
now but we'd like to look at the bright

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,180
side of things too and it's precisely in

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,640
this video right here on visual politic

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,170
that we're going to try and show the

33
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,300
side that no one ever talks about when

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,250
it comes to Iraq and that's it's good

35
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,290
side but does this country really have

36
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,970
an upside what would you think if I told

37
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,560
you that even though this country still

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,810
has loads of problems and is light years

39
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,370
away from being a good place to live

40
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,140
there are still plenty of reasons to be

41
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,030
optimistic well listen up

42
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:46,330
[Applause]

43
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,560
it's time to look at some history after

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,390
all we can't was understand today's Iraq

45
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,310
without taking a look at their past at

46
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,710
least the country's more recent past in

47
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,900
2003 after Saddam Hussein and his regime

48
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,150
fell following the US invasion a state

49
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,350
of chaos and the lack of

50
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,780
institutionality emerged that continues

51
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,590
to this day after the US occupation an

52
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,420
interim government was established for a

53
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,310
year and then a transitional government

54
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,070
was in charge between May 2005 and May

55
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,080
2006 there was this transitional

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,490
government that drafted the current

57
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,480
constitution however despite all these

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,490
attempts for political normalization the

59
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,170
country's governance was virtually

60
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,570
impossible and it was precisely in this

61
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,490
highly conflictive environment with

62
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,990
institutions that were unable to

63
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,030
function and a complete lack of safety

64
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,550
that jihadist militias increased the

65
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,260
influence and power that is how

66
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,360
extremism boomed which resulted in

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,340
numerous attacks that of course caused

68
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,590
huge amounts of damage and greatly fuels

69
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,690
the anti-western sentiment amongst a

70
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,430
good part of the population

71
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,360
[Applause]

72
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,190
of course the United States and his

73
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,140
allies hadn't only occupied the country

74
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,970
they were unable to bring order to it

75
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,070
and had turns the Iraqi city streets

76
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,140
into Hornets nests that's why the people

77
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,610
who perceived international troops

78
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,350
negatively were no longer just the

79
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,970
supporters of Saddam Hussein's regime

80
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,640
but were a much wider range of people

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,980
and it was precisely this rejection of

82
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,470
the West which grew slowly and explains

83
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,670
news stories like this one Iraq anti-us

84
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,490
cleric moqtada al-sadr x' bloc confirmed

85
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,640
as election winners so is Iraq at risk

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,860
of becoming a new Iran well let's not

87
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,510
get ahead of ourselves then let's go

88
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:34,950
back to 2014 that year an Iraqi man Abu

89
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,320
Bakr al-baghdadi leader of the Islamic

90
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,180
state jihadist group declared his own

91
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,850
Caliphate world caliph aids on Iraqi

92
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,680
lands he came to be considered a

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,390
successor of muhammad and his corps

94
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,450
mobilised vast numbers of militants the

95
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,040
restoration of the caliphate who learns

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
at the beginning of a huge military

97
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,820
offensive by isis where heinous crimes

98
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,440
were committed while capturing huge

99
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,510
amounts of lands even important iraqi

100
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,970
cities like Mosul or Fallujah fell under

101
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,650
their power and with that the most

102
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,300
recent reign of terror had been created

103
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,380
[Music]

104
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,110
and we all know this story especially

105
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,970
now that the United States has confirmed

106
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,160
that it has eliminated Abu Bakr al

107
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,310
Baghdadi he died like a dog he died like

108
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,100
a coward the fact is that since 2014 the

109
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,840
defeat of Isis became the number-one

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,210
priority of both the Iraqi government as

111
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,250
Iraq was held against the ropes due to

112
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,560
Isis's advance and also the United

113
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,240
States government's as well as of course

114
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,430
the Kurds who we discussed in depth in a

115
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,120
recent video

116
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,050
[Music]

117
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,090
and of course faced with this challenge

118
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,919
all of the Iraqi government's efforts

119
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,750
were focused on defeating the Islamic

120
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,729
state everything else just drifted into

121
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,470
the backgrounds as you can imagine this

122
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,479
meant Iraq social and economic advances

123
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,550
were paralyzed for a very long time who

124
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,259
would dare to invest in a shattered

125
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,240
country there was also being invaded by

126
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,849
Isis barbarians the worst part is that

127
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,620
despite all their efforts and help from

128
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,780
the West the threat of Isis still hasn't

129
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,430
disappeared even though the Caliphate

130
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,159
has been dismantled Isis is regaining

131
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,470
strength in Iraq and Syria

132
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,479
[Music]

133
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:19,129
but hold on just a second at the

134
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,599
beginning of this video we did promise

135
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,159
that we weren't going to talk about the

136
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,319
bad side of Iraq in fact we said we were

137
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,789
going to talk about the opposite and

138
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:27,800
it's hard to find positive things in a

139
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,930
place like Iraq but believe me there are

140
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,520
some the fact is that after the

141
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,349
caliphates fall the iraqi institutions

142
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,150
have been strengthened and security has

143
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,339
greatly improved this is made Iraq begin

144
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,500
to take a few steps forward

145
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,970
[Music]

146
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,050
Jameses arrived better late than never I

147
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,190
don't think anyone would doubt the

148
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,990
difficulty of rebuilding a country that

149
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,750
has practically been at war since 1980

150
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,099
it's almost 40 years it's a situation

151
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,830
that not only didn't improve with the US

152
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,349
invasion that actually got worse after

153
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:05,849
the occupation and the violence that

154
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,069
broke out Baghdad became a city divided

155
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,110
by large walls military controls and

156
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,970
road blocks everywhere mobility in the

157
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,650
city was very very difficult to give you

158
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,720
an idea it took hours to cross the city

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,669
by car because of the huge number of

160
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,530
detours and controls that you had to

161
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,180
cross the city looked more like a

162
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,520
gigantic military base than a country's

163
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,349
capital citizens lived at virtually

164
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,539
kidnapped existence curfews were common

165
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,130
and it wasn't even safe to go outside

166
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,210
for tea or coffee

167
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,340
Baghdad condemned you to a terrible life

168
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,319
and in many cases a pretty short one

169
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,120
however after the defeat of the Islamic

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
state caliphate in Iraq things have

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
begun to improve by leaps and bounds

172
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,199
check this out

173
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,820
to turn the situation around one of the

174
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,710
key measures that the Iraqi government

175
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,449
has implemented has been the plan to

176
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,460
eliminate all military checkpoints

177
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,349
obstacles and interior walls that

178
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,880
separated neighborhoods from each other

179
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,500
after 15 years of living with these

180
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,240
elements Baghdad's population has

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,370
experienced worrying social changes

182
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,469
mostly a result of isolation the

183
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:06,090
isolation of the neighborhoods created

184
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,830
closed communities which barely had

185
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,659
contact with other communities within

186
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,159
the city this led to an increase in

187
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,900
violence and rejection among the

188
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,669
different groups once access was

189
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,350
restored

190
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,110
and to combat this the first step to

191
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,900
take is evidence Rack lives nearly 30

192
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,270
kilometres of blast walls from Baghdad

193
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,900
official Iraq plans to remove 300

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,760
checkpoints erect security fence in

Baghdad quote more than 600 streets will

196
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,860
be opened up in Baghdad and all concrete

197
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,720
blocks will be removed from streets in

200
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
imagine how I would have been to live in

201
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,390
Baghdad in the last decade it would've

202
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,250
been a true nightmare but the changes

203
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,260
don't just end with the capital so

204
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,970
what's happening in other parts of Iraq

205
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,490
is it as significant as they say

206
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,659
[Music]

207
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,620
emerging from between two opposite poles

208
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,669
even though it may be hard to believe

209
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,680
there is more good news on the horizon

210
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,240
for Iraq it looks like things are

211
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,129
starting to function again public works

212
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,169
have increased housing construction is

213
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,669
at its highest level in recent decades

214
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:18,240
and crude oil production is skyrocketing

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,919
Iraq's oil production has nearly doubled

216
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,080
over the past decade according to OPEC

217
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,639
crude oil exports have grown to around

218
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,979
3.8 million barrels per day allowing

219
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,110
Iraq to make almost 70 billion dollars

220
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,380
in 2018 Iraq is pumping record oil

221
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,320
creating a fully blown migraine for OPEX

222
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,690
cutting plans the problem stems from the

223
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,310
fact that the relationship between the

224
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,269
central government and the

225
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,190
semi-autonomous region of Iraqi

226
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,410
Kurdistan which also happens to be where

227
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,970
a large part of the closet's can be

228
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,279
found is frankly a rather bad and in

229
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,170
fact one of the reasons for this tension

230
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,450
is oil in Iraq all exports depends

231
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,010
heavily on the Kurdish region the

232
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,720
central government and the Kurds share

233
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,820
oil revenues and sometimes this ends up

234
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,560
serving as a political weapon for each

235
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
side in order for them to put pressure

236
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,010
on each other but this isn't the main

237
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,660
reason for their bad relationship the

238
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,910
real trigger was the Iraqi Kurdistan

239
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,829
independence referendum which we

240
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,600
discussed previously right here on this

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,150
channel

242
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,350
[Music]

243
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,270
without a doubt one of the things that

244
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,980
has aroused the most fears and

245
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,660
misgivings and investors and the

246
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,070
international community has been the

247
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,170
relationship between Baghdad and Tehran

248
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,300
so yes in Washington they must be

249
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,740
pulling their hair out you invade a

250
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,420
country you spend a fortune you have a

251
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,460
lot of casualties and in the end that

252
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,290
country ends up in the hands of one of

253
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,390
your greatest enemies it's all pretty

254
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:43,830
crazy iran-backed militias are here to

255
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,690
stay

256
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,640
Iran dominates Iraq after us quote

257
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,680
handed the country over end quote

258
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,920
so that's how it is well though to be

259
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,600
fair we should state that Iran's

260
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,100
influence seems to have lost a bit of

261
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,230
steam in recent years this may be due to

262
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,090
among other things enormous pressure

263
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,070
from Saudi Arabia but even so we're

264
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,660
talking about a relationship that puts

265
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,430
many political leaders around the world

266
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,330
especially in Washington on edge you see

267
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,730
a union comprised of these two countries

268
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,010
Iran and Iraq joined together would lead

269
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,600
to an alliance that would have combined

270
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,540
reserves of more than 300 billion easy

271
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,650
to exploit oil barrels this would be the

272
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,480
largest conventional oil reserve in the

273
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,370
world it's more than the reserves of

274
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,620
Saudi Arabia or Venezuela we're talking

275
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,200
about an alliance that with 120 million

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,300
inhabitants and such natural resources

277
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,130
could easily become the greatest power

278
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,810
in the Middle East once more we're

279
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,310
talking about two Shiite majority

280
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,590
countries two of the three Shiite

281
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,970
majorities in the world

282
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,920
the other one is Azerbaijan

283
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,709
and don't think I need to remind you

284
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,359
that's in that area of the world

285
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,819
religious ties are extremely important

286
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,259
while the fact is that in modern-day

287
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,420
Iraq there are at least 30 armed groups

288
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,549
most of them Iran supporters who make up

289
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,290
these so-called popular mobilization

290
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,869
forces these paramilitary forces of no

291
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:07,470
less than 125,000 troops

292
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,059
125,000 troops over which Tehran holds

293
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,569
very important influence and this is

294
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:14,739
something that the Iraqi government

295
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:16,989
itself has tried to curb but in all

296
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,519
honesty haven't really been very

297
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,079
successful first the armed groups were

298
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,970
invited to leave their loyalty to Iran

299
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,160
in order to join the Iraqi armed forces

300
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,480
and now they're trying to do it by force

301
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,429
which is put in the country on alert

302
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,109
again getting rid of one no need to get

303
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,179
saddled with another some countries just

304
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:34,899
seem doomed death toll soar as pro Iran

305
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,480
militias accused of shooting protesters

306
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,489
now is precisely due to this wave of

307
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,319
violence that the Iraqi government is

308
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,970
now trying to put more distance between

309
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,220
themselves and the Iranian regime and to

310
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,470
look more towards Riyadh instead that is

311
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,359
the Iraqi government's new strategy and

312
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,739
who once we aren't talking about

313
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:52,060
military issues

[Music]

315
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,950
Saudi Arabia makes inroads in Iraq to

316
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,079
curb Iranian influence the state-owned

317
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,209
oil company Aramco the chemical company

318
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:07,519
sounded basic industries and the mining

319
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,470
company Mardan are just a few of the big

320
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,089
Saudi corporations that are looking to

321
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,190
set up in Iraq by establishing joint

322
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,470
ventures or making direct and indirect

323
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,420
investments in Iraqi companies moreover

324
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,550
Saudi Arabia opens another consulate in

325
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,949
Baghdad at the beginning of April 2019

326
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,350
accompanied by an aid package worth 1

327
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,000
billion dollars and that's not all

328
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,610
because at the end of October 2019 King

329
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,800
Salman and Iraqi Prime Minister Marty

330
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,839
Nets in Saudi Arabia and signed at least

331
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,850
13 agreements related to trade energy

332
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,510
and political cooperation

333
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,000
yes it looks like the Iraqi government

334
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,860
wants to take advantage of the Arab cold

335
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,870
war to get their share and flood the

336
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,490
country with dollars makes sense

337
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,290
wouldn't you think now will the popular

338
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,690
mobilization forces allow this or will

339
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,670
they once again unleash a campaign of

340
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,620
violence and terror to stabilize the

341
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,630
country for another decade and will Iraq

342
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,399
finally succeed and take the leap

343
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,260
towards stability and development well
