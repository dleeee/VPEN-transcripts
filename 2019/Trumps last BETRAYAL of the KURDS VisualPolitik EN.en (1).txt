1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,070
I feel that we are doing the right thing

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,629
and I think the country feels that too

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,250
we've had tremendous support outside of

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,140
the Washington little Washington area

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,820
and even in Washington people are saying

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,290
you're doing the right thing has to be

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,880
done otherwise you're never gonna do it

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,740
at the same time we're dealing with both

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,450
sides we're gonna see what we can do

10
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,030
a phone call from the Turkish president

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,710
that's all it took for Trump to decide

12
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,510
something that means nothing less than

13
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,580
the betrayal once again of one of the

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,920
United States's greatest Middle Eastern

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,750
allies this resolved the Kurdish people

16
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,850
the largest ethnic minority in the

17
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,350
region without a state of their own

18
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,870
we're talking about 25 to 35 million

19
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,550
people but just a second because this

20
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,010
isn't the United States's first treason

21
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,320
against its Kurdish allies far from it

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,400
in fact the truth is that the largest

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,809
Western power has made several

24
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:51,580
hard-to-understand decisions especially

25
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,440
if we consider that the Kurdish people

26
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,300
have been involved in practically every

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,430
conflict in the area if it was of

28
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,720
interest to the US the Kurds have sided

29
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,280
with the Americans in the worst moments

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,080
and quite often when the Americans

31
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,940
wanted to save some of their own the

32
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,080
Kurds stepped in to help them in battle

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,369
that explains why the United States

34
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,799
armed and equipped the Kurds for decades

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,990
now don't think for a second that we're

36
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,600
only talking about past issues not at

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,310
all the last decisive incidents

38
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,200
involving Kurdish troops participation

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,270
was in October during the fight against

40
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,159
the Islamic state which had invaded a

41
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,719
large part of the Iraqi territory

42
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,259
between 2015 and 2016 in facts it's no

43
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,850
exaggeration to say that without the

44
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,729
Kurds Isis would most probably still be

45
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,710
a strong operation and we are referring

46
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,229
to a false caliphate reduced to dust but

47
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,329
a much larger problem given all this

48
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,820
complex history this video will focus on

49
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,189
two key questions while the Kurds so

50
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,810
important to the United States and

51
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,210
Turkey and why and how has the United

52
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,950
States repeatedly betrayed them

53
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,730
throughout history so listen up

54
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:04,320
[Applause]

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,460
difference of issue politic at this

56
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,350
point in the game something is quite

57
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,150
clear president Trump's international

58
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,510
policy is now should we put it unique it

59
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,220
could be described as curious or perhaps

60
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,410
shocking unstable volatile capricious

61
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,290
all of these words let's just say that

62
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,110
it's hard to define Russia please if you

63
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,170
can get us Hillary Clinton's emails

64
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,900
please yes Russia to go get the email

65
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,880
mr. president sir and I'm in the white

66
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,160
house that I was lonely I said let's go

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,930
to Iraq yes I the point is that his

68
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,820
condescending behavior and his penchant

69
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,650
for praising dictators such as Kim

70
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,260
jong-un and barely Democratic presidents

71
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,030
such as Putin has caused a certain

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,650
bewilderment in the international

73
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,090
community and it's no wonder

74
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,740
think about it for a second who in their

75
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,900
right mind is going to trust the country

76
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,420
run by a president who constantly aligns

77
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,830
with such characters while

78
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,010
simultaneously punishing his allies

79
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,600
Trump administration announces tariffs

80
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,300
on whiskey cheese and aircraft from the

81
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,780
EU Trump puts politics before common

82
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,090
sense with EU trade war we certainly

83
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,070
can't call him friendly can we

84
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,530
[Music]

85
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,730
while this way of doing politics which

86
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,190
is so unstable has touched the Kurds

87
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,900
Trump has taken an approach that could

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,510
be defined as well why said X went what

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,060
I really meant was why and how did he do

90
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,470
that well he basically moved his

91
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,390
American troops out of the way to clear

92
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,129
the path for Turkish troops to attack

93
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:40,890
his Kurdish allies in northern Syria yes

94
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,510
you heard that right

95
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,480
US troops retreat from North Syria has

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,090
begun Berta Juan this comes as turkey

97
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,610
plans operation east of Euphrates River

98
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,790
in northern Syria Trump's shameful

99
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,920
abandonment at the Kurds the u.s. owes

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,510
the Syrian democratic forces some

101
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,010
loyalty for their fight against the

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,700
Islamic state user Juan vows to crush

103
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,099
heads of Kurdish fighters don't tell me

104
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,599
that that doesn't sound serious and it

105
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,430
certainly doesn't seem like the best way

106
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,150
to treat an ally does it

107
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,980
[Music]

108
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,050
but now hold on a second because the

109
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,639
problem is actually much more complex

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,410
than it seems throughout this story the

111
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,450
United States stands between two great

112
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,240
adversaries the Kurds and the Turks so

113
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,580
at this point we need to take a closer

114
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,889
look at those relationships what exactly

115
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,660
is happening between Turkey and the

116
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,250
Kurds and why does the United States

117
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,830
seem to hold such a key position in this

118
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:47,060
matter turkey or the Kurds the United

119
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,830
States for virtually the entire

120
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,630
international community and for anyone

121
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,130
interested in what's happening in the

122
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,520
world

123
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,260
relations between Turkey and the Kurds

124
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,880
have always been a bit of a headache

125
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,160
on the one hand Turkey is a fundamental

126
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,169
and very important ally for the United

127
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,639
States and various European countries

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,010
Turkey is a NATO member that holds a

129
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,900
privileged geographical position we're

130
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,220
talking about a country that's located

131
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,130
in Europe's extreme east near Russia and

132
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,600
at the gates of the Middle East it's a

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,639
country that has borders with Iran Iraq

134
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,229
and Syria but a different way Turkey's

135
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,970
position is so important that to

136
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,889
preserve their interests their Western

137
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,020
powers are willing to be permissive with

138
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,789
the Turkish government's actions and

139
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,470
current president Erdogan knows that

140
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,570
this can be seen for example in his

141
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,729
closeness to Russia or his constant

142
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,150
conflicts with the European Union on the

143
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,950
other hand there are the Kurds one of

144
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,690
the most moderate peoples in the Middle

145
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,250
East despite being a predominantly

146
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,229
Muslim society they have a well-defined

147
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,150
secular character and a strong

148
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,610
opposition to radical Islamism so the

149
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,860
Kurds have fought for decades using US

150
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,780
provisions and weapons in a multitude of

151
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,490
conflicts and wars against local

152
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,620
dictatorships and Islamist groups such

153
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,720
as the Islamic state indeed making them

154
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,380
practically disappear you see both

155
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,090
Turkey and the Kurdish people have in

156
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,250
recent decades been key allies of the

157
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,080
great Western powers the problem is that

158
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,789
relations between the Turks and the

159
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,410
Kurds at an all-time low

160
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,330
why well that's because of a long time

161
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,210
conflict

162
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,220
in 1920 after the end of World War one

163
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,740
the Treaty of Sevres was signed in Paris

164
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,389
between Turkey and the Allied countries

165
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,099
with the exception of Russia and the

166
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:27,509
United States it called for the

167
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,280
dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire and

168
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,650
the creation of a Kurdish state so

169
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,840
logically the Kurds expected they would

170
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,030
have their own state however this treaty

171
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,740
was never implemented the Turkish

172
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,050
nationalists led by Ataturk rebelled

173
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,449
seized power and got the United States

174
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,330
to agree on a new treaty in 1923 the

175
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,370
Treaty of Lausanne which I raised the

176
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,440
possibility of a Kurdish State from the

177
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,759
map since then the Kurds have organized

178
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,050
themselves politically and militarily

179
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,960
with one goal in mind to confront Turkey

180
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,150
and get back what the Treaty of Sevres

181
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,379
promised them of course this

182
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,629
confrontation has gone from bad to much

183
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,879
worse and has led to one of the most

184
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,280
entrenched conflicts in the world the

185
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,810
military arm of the Kurdistan Workers

186
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,729
Party ended up perpetrating bloody

187
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,620
attacks in Turkey for decades while the

188
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,599
Turkish Armed Forces had no qualms about

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,180
executing harsh reprisal of course the

190
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,710
Kurds aren't only confined to Turkey

191
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,569
there are also Kurds living in Iran Iraq

192
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,750
and Syria

193
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,630
and it's the Kurdish organizations in

194
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,160
Iraq and Syria which have been

195
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,230
particularly close allies of the United

196
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,730
States in recent years but for the

197
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,410
Turkish government all Kurds are a

198
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,660
problem no matter where they live or who

199
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,550
they're allied with they understand that

200
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,320
if autonomous and independent Kurdish

201
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,970
governments formed in any of these

202
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,190
places it could pose a serious threat to

203
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,020
their sovereignty so as you can see it's

204
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,220
a pretty complicated situation and this

205
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,290
leads us to a key question if it was up

206
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,420
to you who would you support the Turks

207
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,430
or the Kurds why is the question that

208
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,260
has long been asked in Washington and

209
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,820
you know what it definitely seems that

210
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,710
in the end it's the most powerful one

211
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:09,270
who gets to hold the stick when all the

212
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,490
cards are on the table which is the most

213
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,980
expendable side which will Washington

214
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,810
choose will they choose a historically

215
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,760
consolidated and economically and

216
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,070
militarily strong state or a stateless

217
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,930
people if this were an exam question it

218
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,550
wouldn't seem very complicated well

219
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,990
that's precisely why the Kurds have been

220
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,540
betrayed or at least cast aside by the

221
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,760
United States on so many occasions since

222
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,890
the early 20th century and the last time

223
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,510
was very recently in the beginning of

224
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,820
October 2019 and there was a clear

225
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,830
protagonist Donald Trump they didn't

226
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,690
help usher in the Second World War they

227
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,820
didn't help us with Normandy as an

228
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,099
example this is like Israel and the

229
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,290
Palestinians okay there are only one

230
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,790
difference maybe the hatreds even

231
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,990
greater is that possible maybe not

232
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,190
prompts leaders betrayal the United

233
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,540
States has turned its back on its

234
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,910
Kurdish allies not once not twice not

235
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,250
three times but at least seven or eight

236
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,740
times at least from what is officially

237
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,240
known without digging too deep one of

238
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,340
the most serious betrayals and one which

239
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,960
has caused the most controversy in the

240
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,700
United States political and military

241
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,800
circles is the one that president Donald

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,210
Trump promoted at the beginning of

243
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,890
October 2019 as you may know Trump

244
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,960
announced and executed the withdrawal of

245
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,940
US troops from Syria's northeastern

246
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,740
border after a phone call with Aragon

247
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,990
the US troops between a hundred and 150

248
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,670
have been mobilized to other parts of

249
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,710
Syria that this movement cleared a path

250
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,420
for the Turkish army allowing them to

251
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,760
enter into direct confrontation with the

252
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,070
Kurds of the Syrian democratic forces a

253
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,279
group which was key in defeating Isis

254
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,980
which we have spent tremendous amounts

255
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,199
of money on helping the Kurds in terms

256
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,509
of ammunition in terms of weapons in

257
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,459
terms of money in terms of pay with all

258
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,439
of that being said we like the Kurds

259
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:53,970
we've spent a tremendous and they're

260
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,769
fighting for their land so when you say

261
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,870
they're fighting with us yes but they're

262
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,490
fighting for the land yeah that is how

263
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,170
Trump shows appreciation for these

264
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,060
sacrifices of those who helped end

265
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,040
Isis's reign of terror when you think

266
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,750
about last given what we've seen we

267
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,759
cannot be surprised that the Kurds feel

268
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,920
betrayed and deceived my friends ladies

269
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,470
who needs enemies Syrian Kurds see

270
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,240
American betrayal and warned fight

271
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,759
against Isis is now in doubt but hold on

272
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,680
just a second because that isn't the

273
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,260
worst thing of all not as all in fact

274
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,470
[Music]

275
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,210
the worst thing is that this decision

276
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,010
creates a very dangerous precedent

277
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,020
because it deals a harsh blow to the

278
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,270
confidence other allies of the US in the

279
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,740
Middle East will have in the United

280
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,810
States going forward after all if they

281
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,820
betrayed the Kurds today what guarantee

282
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,560
is there that something similar won't

283
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,780
happen to others tomorrow one incentive

284
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,640
to groups related to Western interests

285
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,980
have to rely on the United States how

286
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,570
can they trust them like I said it's

287
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,890
complicated but we're not done yet

288
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,990
because we still haven't told you how

289
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,330
this trumpian decision was made one tip

290
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,060
you might want to sit down for this one

291
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,200
under normal circumstances we would

292
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,610
expect a president to make such an

293
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,410
important decision based on some

294
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,240
consensus or agreements with the

295
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,340
Pentagon or with recommendations from

296
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,690
the State Department or at the very

297
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,820
least after some agreements with the

298
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,500
political leaders of his own party in

299
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,940
the House of Representatives and the

300
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,280
Senate well none of these things happens

301
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,650
because well Trump's different and this

302
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,870
decision was made against every single

303
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,160
relevant participants recommendation if

304
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,140
we go on to the theory that some of the

305
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,180
folks in Washington who all do very well

306
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,640
with the military-industrial complex I

307
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,690
mean you know the military-industrial

308
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,420
complex got tremendous power they like

309
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,980
fighting they make a lot of money when

310
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,200
they fight and of course that didn't sit

311
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,030
well with the ranks of the Republican

312
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,920
Party especially if we consider that he

313
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,030
already attempted a withdrawal from

314
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,640
Syria in December of 2018 and that ended

315
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,080
with the resignation of the Secretary of

316
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,000
Defense James mattis and of Brett

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,740
McGurk's the then special presidential

318
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,600
envoy for the global coalition to

319
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,940
counter ISIL

320
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,920
my intention phenomena General James pet

321
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,940
dog

322
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:08,649
[Applause]

323
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,740
like it says is the real deal in his

324
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,050
resignation letter he wrote my views on

325
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,180
treating allies with respect are

326
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,329
strongly held this was how I saw the

327
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,610
strength of America that we keep our

328
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,040
alliances together and keep them tight

329
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,529
perhaps that's why on this occasion even

330
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,569
top level personalities of his own party

331
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,670
as is the case with the leader of the

332
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,230
Republican majority in the Senate Mitch

333
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,999
McConnell have spoken out against this

334
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:40,309
decision and Republicans recoil from

335
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:43,730
Trump's decision to abandon Kurds I urge

336
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,290
the President to keep together our

337
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,689
multinational coalition to defeat Isis

338
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,790
prevent significant conflict between our

339
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,120
NATO ally Turkey and our local Syrian

340
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,990
counterterrorism partners edge of a

341
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,490
Connell leader of the Senate Republican

342
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,350
majority and not only that other

343
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,910
prominent senators such as Lindsey

344
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,439
Graham also from the Republican Party

345
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,420
have warned about the risks that trump

346
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,519
doesn't want to see and have proposed

347
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,889
sanctions against Turkey and even their

348
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,930
expulsion from NATO if they end up

349
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,089
invading northern Syria and crushing the

350
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,579
Kurds who introduced bipartisan

351
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:15,439
sanctions against Turkey if they invade

352
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:16,879
Syria and we'll call for their

353
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,740
suspension from NATO if they attack

354
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,019
Kurdish forces who assisted the u.s. and

355
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,370
the destruction of the Isis Caliphate

356
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,680
also some leaders close to the United

357
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,689
States such as Benjamin Netanyahu have

358
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,329
spoken in the same way

359
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,769
Israel strongly condemns the Turkish

360
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,660
invasion of the Kurdish areas in Syria

361
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,790
and warned against the ethnic cleansing

362
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,860
of the Kurds by Turkey and its proxies

363
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,360
Israel is prepared to extend

364
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,490
humanitarian assistance to the gallon

365
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,100
Kurdish people

366
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,560
and you know what it's no longer just a

367
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,810
matter of loyalty to their allies but

368
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,339
it's a matter of national security

369
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:50,930
for example Kurdish troops are currently

370
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,579
holding more than thirty thousand

371
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:54,199
militants loyal to the Islamic state

372
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,630
militants who could be released if there

373
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,519
was a conflict with Turkey but knowing

374
00:13:58,519 --> 00:13:59,810
the current tenants of the white house

375
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,819
you may be curious well how is Trump

376
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,160
reacted to all of this well in his usual

377
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,009
way with blows threats as well the usual

378
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,069
Twitter storm as I have stated strongly

379
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:12,259
before and just to reiterate Turkey does

380
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,420
anything that I in my great and

381
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,759
unmatched wisdom considered to be

382
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,480
off-limits

383
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,940
I will totally destroy and obliterate

384
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,920
the economy of Turkey I've done before

385
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,509
by the way this isn't the first time

386
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,279
Trump has betrayed the Kurds he already

387
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,160
did this in Iraq in 2017 we tell you

388
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,620
about that in this video since then what

389
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,600
happens was that the United States under

390
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,339
the trump administration simply looked

391
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,630
the other way but now it's your turn

392
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,370
what do you think the United States's

393
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,440
position should be in the Turkish

394
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,300
Kurdish conflict should the u.s. keep

395
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,740
close ties with the Kurds as they were

396
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,930
the main actors in Isis's defeat instead

397
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,670
of betraying them and allowing Turkey to

398
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,139
attack them is this just Trump

399
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:50,300
committing his latest irresponsible act

400
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,980
