30
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,440
the end of 2018 couldn't have been more

31
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,660
stressful the protests of the so-called

32
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,180
yellow vests have unleashed a wave of

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,860
violence and political rebellion in

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:28,080
Emmanuel macron France increasing fuel

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,750
taxes to reduce its consumption and also

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,790
to increase income has infuriated a

37
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,740
large part of French society so to

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,360
reject this measure and to take

39
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,220
advantage and ask for more changes

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,660
hundreds of thousands of people

41
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,400
mobilized and took to the streets

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,830
wearing yellow vests might think we all

43
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,410
know what came next thousands of arrests

44
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,330
hundreds of wounded and to government

45
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,910
held against the ropes forced to take a

46
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,210
step back or conferred a logistical

47
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,170
setback police here and on down want a

48
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,550
guard and commerce will be betting on

49
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,410
poppy but just a second because in this

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,640
video we're actually going to talk about

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
China and not France China China now

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,220
China China and why the hell you talking

53
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,470
about yellow vest Simon what's going on

54
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,380
I don't know

55
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,990
[Music]

56
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,000
well no I haven't lost my mind Frances

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
incident may have led to a more violent

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,010
result than expected but it isn't an

59
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,620
unusual one when the society doesn't

60
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,630
feel represented by its politicians or

61
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,040
believes that their rights as citizens

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,410
are being violated protests and

63
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,570
demonstrations commonplace however this

64
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,600
doesn't happen in China which leads to a

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,210
few important questions why do we never

66
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,310
see protests like this in China don't

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,080
the Chinese have more than enough

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,970
reasons to feel dissatisfied and perhaps

69
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,740
the key question here how does the

70
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,320
Chinese government to keep 1.3 billion

71
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,840
people under control without any sign of

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,940
discontent all right so right now some

73
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,950
of you probably figure well yes Simon

74
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,590
it's a dictatorship what did you expect

75
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,410
and yes you are right but that doesn't

76
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,490
tell the whole story

77
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,020
there's you know there's always more to

78
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,939
it so listen up

79
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:14,310
but Chinese non change

80
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,380
despite the reforms which we've already

81
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,810
spoken here on visual politic about 20

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,730
or 30 years ago it was expected that

83
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,190
today's China would be really different

84
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,600
many experts predicted that as the

85
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,580
Chinese economy began to prosper and its

86
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,920
middle class grow within a short time

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,200
social demands would cause a change in

88
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,840
the political system towards a more open

89
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,570
free and less corrupt system since then

90
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,160
the country has experienced an

91
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,810
impressive economic takeoff and the

92
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,880
Chinese middle class is now composed of

93
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,810
hundreds of millions of people

94
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,780
[Music]

95
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,880
but there's still no trace of riots

96
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,100
okay now yes there have been protests

97
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,230
but there's no real comparison here and

98
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,970
for many Chinese people seeing a

99
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,160
demonstration is kind of like seeing the

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,890
beer calling you know it exists but you

101
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,780
don't really want to get involved with

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,340
it and not only that but with Xi

103
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,790
Jingping

104
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,890
in power the exact opposite is happening

105
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,230
while Chinese society is experiencing

106
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,810
its best moment in history in economic

107
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,880
terms Xi Jinping is the most powerful

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,760
president since Mao in fact he won't

109
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,190
even respect the to mandate limitation

110
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,500
that Chinese leaders had to adhere to

111
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,780
yeah but not the case like that of ever

112
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:39,080
others in Bolivia

113
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,000
but let's go back to the question at

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,190
hand why does the Chinese government

115
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,080
have so much control over everything

116
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,180
that happens and why hasn't this control

117
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,430
suffered any erosion despite the fact

118
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,350
that now the country is much richer and

119
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,720
much more open to the world and also

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
well what can we expect in the future

121
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,710
well folks there are three key questions

122
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,450
that we're going to answer in this video

123
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,550
mint yes we're going to talk about the

124
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,770
repression machine later but we can also

125
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,170
find some additional elements here so

126
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,140
check it out

127
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,370
[Music]

128
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,020
the pact a recent New York Times article

129
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,910
talked about how the Chinese government

130
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,500
has managed to turn their economic

131
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,230
development into a way to legitimize the

132
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,640
regime and that has a lot to do with the

133
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,680
kind of tacit pact that exists between

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,750
the Chinese government and a good

135
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,730
portion of Chinese society it's an

136
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,740
agreement based on the following the

137
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,540
government promises to do what it can to

138
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,640
achieve better living conditions and in

139
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,100
return society or at least the good part

140
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,870
of it doesn't question the government

141
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,180
itself and looks the other way on some

142
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,370
political issues so here's a question

143
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,830
and it's controversial but it's really

144
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,020
topical would you be willing to renounce

145
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,430
civil liberties and political

146
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,620
participation in exchange for an

147
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,150
improvement in your standard of living

148
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,860
well you can leave your answer to that

149
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,080
in the comments below and also in this

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,910
survey

151
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,970
[Music]

152
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,590
but don't worry the video is not ending

153
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,139
just yet now this is all very easy to

154
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,780
say but it's not easy to carry out

155
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,340
so the question we can ask ourselves now

156
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,110
is how is the Chinese government managed

157
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,730
to fulfill its part of this bargain well

158
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,900
we've already talked about one of the

159
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,760
issues on visual politic it's in a video

160
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,740
we made about the reforms in the country

161
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,389
that were carried out after Mao's death

162
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,669
to create wealth the Chinese government

163
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,190
put aside economic Marxism and freed the

164
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,410
forces of private enterprise competition

165
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,550
globalism and capitalism

166
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,380
now we've already told you this but

167
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,120
that's not all the other element that

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,100
the government has used has been none

169
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,139
other than education and it's not only

170
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,880
just because they control the contents

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,770
which we all know see to make everyone

172
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,300
feel like they had a chance especially

173
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,340
the almost 40% of the rural population

174
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,380
that's still mostly poor and this

175
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,389
amounts to more than 500 million people

176
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,740
in the part of China that doesn't have

177
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,540
Shanghai skyscrapers the Chinese

178
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,889
government has created a social

179
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,229
narrative by which anyone who strives

180
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,300
regardless of their economic level can

181
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,220
climb the ladder of social mobility and

182
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,550
reach the highest echelon so how did the

183
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,150
government do that

184
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,530
while they did it through universities

185
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,319
and an access system known as cow cow

186
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,690
the cow cow is a very hard test that if

187
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,130
you pass it guarantees you the

188
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,810
opportunity to study at a higher

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,470
income level and your family's situation

191
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,690
because in China unless you have money

192
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,419
access isn't universal indeed it's far

193
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,310
from it each year nine million young

194
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,139
people compete for only tens of

195
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,639
thousands of places and most young

196
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,530
people know that University it can

197
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,000
change their life you could already

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,530
imagine the incredible amount of

199
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,570
competition that exists stuff just pass

200
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,740
this one exam but in a country where

201
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,020
corruption in institutions is usually

202
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,240
part of the game a gaucho is seen as an

203
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,550
opportunity relatively fair test that

204
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,690
any student can access that way the

205
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,340
narrative that the Chinese government is

206
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,320
built for years is that in this country

207
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,270
there's full social mobility and any

208
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,740
young person regardless of their

209
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,780
family's income level can progress up

210
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,580
the social scale and on the flipside of

211
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,319
that there's obviously if they don't

212
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,949
achieve that progress it's all on them

213
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,050
cow cow allows the government to say if

214
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,759
you are not successful you can only

215
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,720
blame yourself

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,430
you did not work hard enough that is a

217
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,979
very powerful way of governing Yong Zhao

218
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,229
an education professor at the University

219
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,630
of Kansas actually it really isn't like

220
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,610
that the GAO cow is a system that favors

221
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,349
some skills over others and therefore

222
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,600
some students over other students but

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,430
the Chinese government has managed to

224
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,959
introduce this interpretation of

225
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,890
equality into their society

226
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:58,510
[Music]

227
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,610
downtown the Chinese government has kept

228
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,829
Chinese society relatively satisfied

229
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:05,650
over the past few years

230
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,620
[Music]

231
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,630
the Chinese have seen how their lives

232
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,490
improve year after year and thanks to

233
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,500
the GAO Cowan's a university system that

234
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,360
allows for social mobility everyone

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,950
feels like opportunities are available

236
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,780
to everyone in addition the Gao Gao

237
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,790
favours a study model based on memory

238
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,890
and repetition and not on creativity and

239
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,990
critical analysis but something we can

240
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,790
talk about another time but that's not

241
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,660
all so let's continue

242
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:38,500
[Music]

243
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,790
time perspective the second question

244
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,230
that might explain why the country's

245
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,880
economic growth hasn't been accompanied

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,680
by political demands there's a lot to do

247
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,690
with the speed of the changes allow me

248
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,290
to explain

249
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,390
social and cultural changes often happen

250
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,490
much more slowly than economic and

251
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,780
technological changes

252
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,190
[Music]

253
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,949
yes China has experienced a huge amount

254
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:06,810
of developments but not enough time has

255
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,639
passed for political demands to emerge

256
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,250
this isn't strange if we take a look at

257
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,290
the history of Western democracies both

258
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,389
in Europe and even in America or we can

259
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,980
see the political changes have always

260
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,439
been much slower than economic changes

261
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,339
although they did eventually arrive but

262
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,720
we can't forget the countries such as

263
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
Spain Portugal Taiwan South Korea and

264
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
the nations of Eastern Europe among many

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,689
others suffered under dictatorships of

266
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,670
all kinds until only just a few decades

267
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,720
ago in other words the Chinese are still

268
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,189
moving from poverty to a more

269
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:40,199
comfortable lifestyle but yes it's

270
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,970
obvious that we can't talk about the

271
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,410
Chinese government's control over its

272
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,810
citizens without discussing coercion so

273
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,720
listen up

[Music]

277
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,269
I think none of us will be surprised if

278
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,800
I say that the Chinese government has

279
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,660
more than enough tools to subdue

280
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,120
protests in the end China is still a

281
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,370
dictatorship that leads in rankings like

282
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,180
these China named world's top

283
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,089
executioner as global rate Falls amnesty

284
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,550
says more people executed in China than

285
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,310
rest of world combined

286
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,440
China is the world's biggest prison for

287
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,029
journalists folks the Chinese

288
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,829
government's control is so great that

289
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,720
busy we all know they've basically been

290
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,110
able to create their own Internet in

291
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,089
China this network is so sensitive that

292
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,160
services like Google YouTube and

293
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,810
Facebook as well as millions of web

294
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,000
pages are simply blocked except for the

295
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,980
use of VPN networks which are of course

296
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,140
illegal the Chinese only see the

297
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,220
information that the Chinese government

298
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,610
allows them to see there's more

299
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,589
it seems that by 2020 the Chinese

300
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,089
government wants to implement a kind of

301
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,130
ranking that will pacify each and every

302
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,140
Chinese citizen based on a lot of

303
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,300
variables credit financial social

304
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,720
political legal etc etc that is the

305
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,130
Chinese government wants to create a

306
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,220
ranking of good and bad citizens maybe

307
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,690
you've seen the television show black

308
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,720
mirror black mirror is almost a reality

309
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,120
China says it's on track to launch its

310
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,760
dystopian scorecard system that ranks

311
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,500
citizens on every aspect of their

312
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,980
behavior by 2020

313
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,200
[Music]

314
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,460
obviously political issues will carry a

315
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,530
great deal of weight so being critical

316
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,120
of the Beijing government could place

317
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,250
you among the most unreliable citizens

318
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,140
which would close many doors to you both

319
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,480
personal and professional which is kind

320
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,820
of terrifying and now you can see the

321
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,690
tools that the Chinese government

322
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,700
employees to maintain its control over

323
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,430
society first the political pact and the

324
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,630
promise of prosperity and opportunity

325
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,760
for all seconds the fact that social

326
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,950
change moves more slowly than economic

327
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,870
change and third the huge amount of

328
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,490
control and repression that the Chinese

329
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,620
government uses these are all reasons

330
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,200
why there are no yellow gusts in China

331
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,890
[Music]

332
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,660
but the question we can all ask

333
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,820
ourselves is will the Chinese government

334
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,280
perpetuate its model or is this country

335
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,680
going to suffer a wave of democratic

336
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,600
change and openness well leave your
