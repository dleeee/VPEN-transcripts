1
00:00:00.0 --> 00:00:04.080
did you know that the United States is

2
00:00:01.74 --> 00:00:05.819
the largest energy power on the planet

3
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:07.470
yep that's absolutely right the United

4
00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.349
States is taking the position as the

5
00:00:07.47 --> 00:00:12.570
world's largest fossil fuel producer no

6
00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.360
other country not even Russia or Saudi

7
00:00:12.57 --> 00:00:18.000
Arabia even come close to this North

8
00:00:15.36 --> 00:00:22.350
American giant the golden era of

9
00:00:18.0 --> 00:00:24.510
American energy is now underway this

10
00:00:22.35 --> 00:00:26.580
energy revolution is having important

11
00:00:24.51 --> 00:00:28.650
consequences and it's changing politics

12
00:00:26.58 --> 00:00:30.779
in the USA and it's also the topic that

13
00:00:28.65 --> 00:00:40.590
we're addressing in this visual politics

14
00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:42.090
video just eight years ago the supply of

15
00:00:40.59 --> 00:00:44.190
petrol and natural gas was one of the

16
00:00:42.09 --> 00:00:45.960
biggest concerns that the USA had about

17
00:00:44.19 --> 00:00:48.000
their future and this wasn't

18
00:00:45.96 --> 00:00:50.010
particularly new concerns the country

19
00:00:48.0 --> 00:00:59.010
has been dependent on foreign petrol and

20
00:00:50.01 --> 00:01:01.859
gas for decades the other thing is that

21
00:00:59.01 --> 00:01:03.359
we have only leased out they're going to

22
00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.900
explore two percent of our outer

23
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.470
continental shelf for oil where it is

24
00:01:06.9 --> 00:01:12.390
believed by everyone familiar with that

25
00:01:09.47 --> 00:01:14.450
fuel and that source of energy that

26
00:01:12.39 --> 00:01:17.159
there are vast supplies yet to be found

27
00:01:14.45 --> 00:01:19.020
secondly we need an active exploration

28
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.670
program America the only way to become

29
00:01:19.02 --> 00:01:22.830
less dependent on foreign sources of

30
00:01:20.67 --> 00:01:27.390
crude oil is to explore at home I think

31
00:01:22.83 --> 00:01:31.350
we can easily within seven eight ten

32
00:01:27.39 --> 00:01:33.509
years if we put our minds to it we can

33
00:01:31.35 --> 00:01:35.159
eliminate our dependence on the places

34
00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.979
in the world that harm our national

35
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.290
security if we don't achieve our

36
00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.590
independence right the most important

37
00:01:40.29 --> 00:01:46.560
thing we can do is to make sure we

38
00:01:43.59 --> 00:01:48.899
control our own energy so here's what

39
00:01:46.56 --> 00:01:51.720
I've done since I've been president we

40
00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.149
have increased oil production to the

41
00:01:51.72 --> 00:01:55.979
highest levels in 16 years at the time

42
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.960
it was said that the national security

43
00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.939
over the USA relies on being able to

44
00:01:57.96 --> 00:02:02.070
ensure the supply of natural gas and

45
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.060
petrol to the industry and economy if it

46
00:02:02.07 --> 00:02:08.970
was so dependent upon it

47
00:02:05.06 --> 00:02:10.740
and this well it wasn't really easy to

48
00:02:08.97 --> 00:02:12.270
do at that time it's possible you might

49
00:02:10.74 --> 00:02:14.430
remember it the world seemed to be

50
00:02:12.27 --> 00:02:17.220
facing an imminent decline in fossil

51
00:02:14.43 --> 00:02:18.420
fuels it really did seem as if we were

52
00:02:17.22 --> 00:02:20.250
about to run out of them

53
00:02:18.42 --> 00:02:24.420
let's have a quick look at the situation

54
00:02:20.25 --> 00:02:26.520
in the USA back at that time from the

55
00:02:24.42 --> 00:02:28.830
early 70s the petrol reserves in the

56
00:02:26.52 --> 00:02:30.989
United States were declining year after

57
00:02:28.83 --> 00:02:32.459
year production had dropped by about 50

58
00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.440
percent and even the production of

59
00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.600
natural gas is starting to decline

60
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:38.920
in other words the United States was

61
00:02:37.6 --> 00:02:41.050
quickly running out of energy resources

62
00:02:38.92 --> 00:02:43.360
and they were at risk of having to rely

63
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:45.460
on suppliers that well weren't exactly

64
00:02:43.36 --> 00:02:47.620
trustworthy in the opinion of those

65
00:02:45.46 --> 00:02:49.270
responsible for national security we are

66
00:02:47.62 --> 00:02:52.900
of course talking about countries like

67
00:02:49.27 --> 00:02:55.210
Saudi Arabia Russia and Nigeria however

68
00:02:52.9 --> 00:02:57.250
things they've changed a lot since then

69
00:02:55.21 --> 00:02:59.110
and as sometimes happens the predictions

70
00:02:57.25 --> 00:03:02.610
were wrong and cream storage tanks

71
00:02:59.11 --> 00:03:05.350
around the world are completely full so

72
00:03:02.61 --> 00:03:09.180
well what exactly is happening well

73
00:03:05.35 --> 00:03:09.180
let's take a closer look at that a

74
00:03:09.9 --> 00:03:16.240
petrol power returns the United States

75
00:03:14.71 --> 00:03:17.890
has gone through an important energy

76
00:03:16.24 --> 00:03:19.780
revolution in the last few years

77
00:03:17.89 --> 00:03:21.430
oil production has almost doubled and

78
00:03:19.78 --> 00:03:24.160
the reserves which can be exploited

79
00:03:21.43 --> 00:03:24.730
guarantee at that supply for many years

80
00:03:24.16 --> 00:03:26.440
to come

81
00:03:24.73 --> 00:03:27.940
look at this chart that we've taken from

82
00:03:26.44 --> 00:03:30.250
The Wall Street Journal it shows the

83
00:03:27.94 --> 00:03:35.860
increase of oil production in the USA

84
00:03:30.25 --> 00:03:37.870
since 2011 as you can probably guess the

85
00:03:35.86 --> 00:03:39.970
fact that the USA has almost doubled its

86
00:03:37.87 --> 00:03:45.490
oil production is closely related to the

87
00:03:39.97 --> 00:03:47.650
huge drops in oil prices since 2014 it's

88
00:03:45.49 --> 00:03:49.840
not just the petrol something really

89
00:03:47.65 --> 00:03:51.820
similar this happens with natural gas as

90
00:03:49.84 --> 00:03:53.740
well today the u.s. is the world's

91
00:03:51.82 --> 00:03:56.020
largest producer of both of these

92
00:03:53.74 --> 00:03:58.690
resources and as you can imagine this

93
00:03:56.02 --> 00:04:00.220
has consequences on multiple fronts but

94
00:03:58.69 --> 00:04:04.330
what has happened so that this boom

95
00:04:00.22 --> 00:04:06.340
could take place well many of you know

96
00:04:04.33 --> 00:04:10.460
it is all due to a technological

97
00:04:06.34 --> 00:04:12.660
revolution known as fracking

98
00:04:10.46 --> 00:04:14.400
this technology well it's actually

99
00:04:12.66 --> 00:04:16.709
nothing new we've known about in the

100
00:04:14.4 --> 00:04:18.720
decades but until recently it wasn't

101
00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.040
really economically viable and look

102
00:04:18.72 --> 00:04:21.090
before we get into this topic any

103
00:04:20.04 --> 00:04:23.070
further we need to point out that

104
00:04:21.09 --> 00:04:25.530
fracking it's a pretty controversial

105
00:04:23.07 --> 00:04:27.780
topic and for now it's only used to

106
00:04:25.53 --> 00:04:30.060
produce petrol on a large scale in four

107
00:04:27.78 --> 00:04:32.190
countries the US Canada Russia and

108
00:04:30.06 --> 00:04:33.300
Argentina at the end of this video and

109
00:04:32.19 --> 00:04:34.770
in the description below we're actually

110
00:04:33.3 --> 00:04:36.960
going to leave a link to something that

111
00:04:34.77 --> 00:04:38.460
will explain how this process works in

112
00:04:36.96 --> 00:04:40.380
its defense would also like to point out

113
00:04:38.46 --> 00:04:41.940
that it is a pretty new technique and as

114
00:04:40.38 --> 00:04:43.560
this technique is being used and

115
00:04:41.94 --> 00:04:44.550
developed it's actual impact is being

116
00:04:43.56 --> 00:04:46.350
reduced

117
00:04:44.55 --> 00:04:47.730
anyway the safety and that sort of thing

118
00:04:46.35 --> 00:04:49.200
is actually a discussion for another

119
00:04:47.73 --> 00:04:50.940
video because in this video we're going

120
00:04:49.2 --> 00:04:55.310
to focus on both the economic and the

121
00:04:50.94 --> 00:04:59.000
political consequences of fracking

122
00:04:55.31 --> 00:05:01.860
feeding the economic engine

123
00:04:59.0 --> 00:05:03.900
first of all oil imports to the US have

124
00:05:01.86 --> 00:05:05.520
been reduced significantly in the United

125
00:05:03.9 --> 00:05:07.770
States Sanders laws of supply and demand

126
00:05:05.52 --> 00:05:10.500
apply all of this additional petrol has

127
00:05:07.77 --> 00:05:11.700
made the prices drop this means the

128
00:05:10.5 --> 00:05:13.590
lesser amounts of petrol that the

129
00:05:11.7 --> 00:05:16.700
country is still importing it's also

130
00:05:13.59 --> 00:05:16.700
significantly cheaper

131
00:05:17.88 --> 00:05:22.650
this is cause the price of gas / petrol

132
00:05:20.46 --> 00:05:24.060
at the pump to fall so much so that it's

133
00:05:22.65 --> 00:05:26.070
actually estimated that American

134
00:05:24.06 --> 00:05:28.800
consumers are saving about a hundred and

135
00:05:26.07 --> 00:05:30.540
fifty billion dollars every year this is

136
00:05:28.8 --> 00:05:32.130
money that is then used for purchasing

137
00:05:30.54 --> 00:05:33.570
other products or setting up businesses

138
00:05:32.13 --> 00:05:36.420
or just putting into a savings account

139
00:05:33.57 --> 00:05:38.820
but hold on a minute because this is not

140
00:05:36.42 --> 00:05:39.630
the end of today's story oh not even

141
00:05:38.82 --> 00:05:41.970
close

142
00:05:39.63 --> 00:05:43.800
chief essential and gas also benefits

143
00:05:41.97 --> 00:05:45.780
industry and not just those industries

144
00:05:43.8 --> 00:05:48.240
that use this type of energy but also

145
00:05:45.78 --> 00:05:52.590
industry that uses it as their raw

146
00:05:48.24 --> 00:05:54.480
material and of course now talking about

147
00:05:52.59 --> 00:05:58.270
the petrochemical industry the one that

148
00:05:54.48 --> 00:06:02.800
produces plastic and PVC

149
00:05:58.27 --> 00:06:05.179
[Music]

150
00:06:02.8 --> 00:06:07.099
the combination of a large quantity of

151
00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:08.869
petrol available the certainty of supply

152
00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.149
and low prices are triggering an

153
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:13.009
industrial boom in the petrochemical

154
00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.979
sector and it's really important to look

155
00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:20.209
at these numbers closely because they're

156
00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.189
absolutely huge the petrochemical sector

157
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:24.019
is developing projects valued at a

158
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:29.419
hundred eighty five billion dollars just

159
00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:31.179
in the United States in 2016 these sorts

160
00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.559
of projects were 50% of the entire

161
00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:35.119
national industrial investment it's

162
00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.919
expected that these investments will

163
00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:40.939
turn the United States into a great

164
00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.979
plastic exporter and just so you get an

165
00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.319
idea they expect that in just a few

166
00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.209
years the net exports of petrol based

167
00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.569
products like plastics and also

168
00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:53.149
fertilizers and solvents will exceed 110

169
00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.129
billion dollars a year this is almost as

170
00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:56.719
much as all of the petrol of Saudi

171
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.759
Arabia exports

172
00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.949
you've got to pinch yourself sometimes

173
00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.169
and say this is the envy of the world

174
00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.059
Neel Chapman president of the chemical

175
00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.979
division at Exxon Mobil such business

176
00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.779
will certainly help the u.s. reduce

177
00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.669
their trade deficits to deficit that

178
00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:13.069
Trump is always complaining about but

179
00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.110
wait a second because well there's yet

180
00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:17.240
more the supply of petrol it's simply no

181
00:07:15.11 --> 00:07:19.550
longer a priority or a concern for the

182
00:07:17.24 --> 00:07:22.189
country's national security in December

183
00:07:19.55 --> 00:07:25.219
2015 US Congress removed the prohibition

184
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:26.959
on exports of natural gas and petrol now

185
00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:28.699
the u.s. is about to become a net

186
00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:30.559
exporter of natural gas and it is

187
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.229
calculated that the US will sell an

188
00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:38.029
average of 1 million petrol barrels per

189
00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:40.759
day in 2017 US oil exports double

190
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:42.559
reshaping vast global markets well the

191
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.929
United States still imports foreign

192
00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:46.219
petrol but much less than it used to so

193
00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:48.319
that because countries like to have

194
00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:50.239
energy security by diversifying their

195
00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:52.789
sources many countries are willing to

196
00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:54.679
pay a premium for this u.s. supply and

197
00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:59.110
you can be sure that the companies in

198
00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:59.110
the US are taking advantage of that

199
00:08:00.48 --> 00:08:04.980
it is in natural gas where this change

200
00:08:02.91 --> 00:08:06.960
has been the greatest until recently the

201
00:08:04.98 --> 00:08:09.390
transport of gas was difficult and huge

202
00:08:06.96 --> 00:08:11.190
gas pipelines were needed but now thanks

203
00:08:09.39 --> 00:08:13.290
to the new technology of liquefied

204
00:08:11.19 --> 00:08:19.920
natural gas it can easily be transported

205
00:08:13.29 --> 00:08:21.870
like petrol in giant tankers the gas

206
00:08:19.92 --> 00:08:24.330
supply this way is almost half of the

207
00:08:21.87 --> 00:08:31.830
world supply and here American companies

208
00:08:24.33 --> 00:08:33.600
are the superstars the u.s. is now

209
00:08:31.83 --> 00:08:35.550
projected to be one of the top three

210
00:08:33.6 --> 00:08:38.340
natural gas exporters in the world by

211
00:08:35.55 --> 00:08:40.229
2020 less imports gas exports a revival

212
00:08:38.34 --> 00:08:42.570
of the industrial sector it all looks

213
00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:47.070
like rather bad timing for Trump's

214
00:08:42.57 --> 00:08:48.930
protectionism and well hold on just a

215
00:08:47.07 --> 00:08:52.280
minute because this energy revolution it

216
00:08:48.93 --> 00:08:58.720
also has political consequences

217
00:08:52.28 --> 00:09:02.910

218
00:08:58.72 --> 00:09:04.799
a diplomatic week

219
00:09:02.91 --> 00:09:06.449
it's impossible to understand the u.s.

220
00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.579
international politics if we don't

221
00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:10.769
consider the impact of this energy

222
00:09:08.579 --> 00:09:13.019
revolution let me explain up until now

223
00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:14.850
the supply of petrol was a priority for

224
00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:16.559
national security the Middle East and

225
00:09:14.85 --> 00:09:18.059
oil and gas producing countries has an

226
00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:22.049
important role in the American

227
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:23.279
diplomatic agenda the new petrol scheme

228
00:09:22.049 --> 00:09:25.470
of the United States has caused

229
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.509
priorities to change for example a new

230
00:09:25.47 --> 00:09:29.729
focus has been placed on Asia which as

231
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:34.049
we've talked about before is a gold mine

232
00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:35.789
of opportunity interestingly without

233
00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:37.049
this change in priorities Obama would

234
00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:39.359
have probably captured the troops in

235
00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:40.889
Iraq and the situation in Yemen Libya or

236
00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:43.350
Syria would have been very very

237
00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:44.939
different but let's be really extra

238
00:09:43.35 --> 00:09:46.769
clear here all of this petroleum means

239
00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:48.899
that the Middle East is not really that

240
00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:50.489
important to the United States anymore a

241
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:52.619
country that can now even afford to

242
00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:54.989
support these so-called Arab NATO which

243
00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:56.429
is something pretty much like okay well

244
00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:58.199
you guys go and take care of your own

245
00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.429
safety band every now and then we'll

246
00:09:58.199 --> 00:10:01.169
give you a hand you know

247
00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:04.350
so hopefully avoid the risk of a global

248
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:06.359
crisis or something needless to say this

249
00:10:04.35 --> 00:10:08.369
energy independence has also given

250
00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:10.319
Washington the opportunity to place more

251
00:10:08.369 --> 00:10:12.359
demands on the petro monarchies of the

252
00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:14.639
Persian Gulf especially when it comes to

253
00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:16.739
human rights and by the way if there is

254
00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:19.169
something that is absolutely certain it

255
00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:21.029
is Trump's support for fracking the new

256
00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:23.220
president wants to continue Obama's who

257
00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:27.169
acts for to do it faster eliminating any

258
00:10:23.22 --> 00:10:27.169
obstacle this might be in the way

259
00:10:27.97 --> 00:10:35.630
American energy first America first

260
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:37.760
America first

261
00:10:35.63 --> 00:10:39.380
Donald Trump has little doubt he made

262
00:10:37.76 --> 00:10:41.420
the promise during his campaign and has

263
00:10:39.38 --> 00:10:43.550
kept his word since taking office his

264
00:10:41.42 --> 00:10:46.130
priority has been to give petrol and gas

265
00:10:43.55 --> 00:10:47.810
development the green light among other

266
00:10:46.13 --> 00:10:49.460
things he promised to eliminate many of

267
00:10:47.81 --> 00:10:51.410
the rules and restrictions Obama passed

268
00:10:49.46 --> 00:10:53.030
which could cause fracking to slow down

269
00:10:51.41 --> 00:10:55.280
Trump well he wants cheap and abundant

270
00:10:53.03 --> 00:10:57.410
petrol antics willing to push to get it

271
00:10:55.28 --> 00:10:59.300
sooner rather than later Trump has also

272
00:10:57.41 --> 00:11:01.310
chosen to surround himself with key

273
00:10:59.3 --> 00:11:04.670
people closely related to the petroleum

274
00:11:01.31 --> 00:11:06.230
industry as Secretary of State

275
00:11:04.67 --> 00:11:10.120
Trump decided to go for Rex Tillerson

276
00:11:06.23 --> 00:11:12.530
who used to be the CEO of Exxon Mobil

277
00:11:10.12 --> 00:11:14.000
then there's Rick Perry the former

278
00:11:12.53 --> 00:11:15.860
governor of Texas who has been placed in

279
00:11:14.0 --> 00:11:17.780
charge of the Department of Energy Texas

280
00:11:15.86 --> 00:11:21.590
is a stage that is very closely related

281
00:11:17.78 --> 00:11:23.060
to the industry and then there is the

282
00:11:21.59 --> 00:11:25.550
head of the US Environmental Protection

283
00:11:23.06 --> 00:11:27.890
Agency scott pruett the Attorney General

284
00:11:25.55 --> 00:11:31.730
in Oklahoma another state well connected

285
00:11:27.89 --> 00:11:33.380
to the petroleum industry anyway this is

286
00:11:31.73 --> 00:11:34.970
a revolution that the u.s. is going

287
00:11:33.38 --> 00:11:39.040
through and it's a revolution that has

288
00:11:34.97 --> 00:11:39.040
put greater limits on the power of OPEC

289
00:11:39.41 --> 00:11:44.089
now there is no question that fracking

290
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:46.039
has its risks but the reality is is that

291
00:11:44.089 --> 00:11:48.139
it's a technology that's not going

292
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:50.749
anywhere and it does seem that with time

293
00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:52.399
and development is going to become safer

294
00:11:50.749 --> 00:11:54.769
but until that time comes the

295
00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:59.929
environmental controls are absolutely

296
00:11:54.769 --> 00:12:01.220
essential and now it's your turn we'd
