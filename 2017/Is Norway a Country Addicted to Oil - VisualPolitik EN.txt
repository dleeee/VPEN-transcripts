[Music]

3
00:00:07.73 --> 00:00:12.210
Norway it's famous for its extreme

4
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.340
climate of long sunny summer days and

5
00:00:12.21 --> 00:00:15.360
long dark winter nights as well as the

6
00:00:14.34 --> 00:00:17.790
extreme cold

7
00:00:15.36 --> 00:00:19.990
[Music]

8
00:00:17.79 --> 00:00:21.730
there are also famous for their welfare

9
00:00:19.99 --> 00:00:23.110
state like any other Nordic country but

10
00:00:21.73 --> 00:00:25.880
perhaps most of all they're famous for

11
00:00:23.11 --> 00:00:27.340
those smoked salmon

12
00:00:25.88 --> 00:00:29.260
[Music]

13
00:00:27.34 --> 00:00:30.640
and it's not just us at visual politic

14
00:00:29.26 --> 00:00:32.619
you think this actually the fishing

15
00:00:30.64 --> 00:00:35.110
industry is one of the most modern and

16
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.670
important in the world however in the

17
00:00:35.11 --> 00:00:38.710
last few years the most significant

18
00:00:36.67 --> 00:00:40.960
element of the Norwegian identity has

19
00:00:38.71 --> 00:00:43.750
been its commitment to the environment

20
00:00:40.96 --> 00:00:44.410
especially its fight against climate

21
00:00:43.75 --> 00:00:45.940
change

22
00:00:44.41 --> 00:00:47.949
and there is no better place for us to

23
00:00:45.94 --> 00:00:50.170
see this than in their adoption of the

24
00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.120
electric car you see Norway has the most

25
00:00:50.17 --> 00:00:53.559
developed market of electric cars in the

26
00:00:52.12 --> 00:00:56.019
world in Norway you'll find that one of

27
00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.300
every two cars sold is either electric

28
00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.850
or it's a hybrid but is even more to

29
00:00:58.3 --> 00:01:01.930
this because by 2025 which is kind of

30
00:01:00.85 --> 00:01:04.570
basically tomorrow

31
00:01:01.93 --> 00:01:07.270
Norway expects to stop selling gas or

32
00:01:04.57 --> 00:01:09.490
diesel powered cars altogether they only

33
00:01:07.27 --> 00:01:11.740
want to sell electric and hybrid cars

34
00:01:09.49 --> 00:01:13.540
this might be pretty hard to imagine

35
00:01:11.74 --> 00:01:15.430
right I mean it's been a hundred years

36
00:01:13.54 --> 00:01:17.530
of combustion engines and it all seems

37
00:01:15.43 --> 00:01:20.369
as if it's about to come to an end at

38
00:01:17.53 --> 00:01:20.369
least in Norway

39
00:01:21.02 --> 00:01:25.399
fear electric car mania well has even

40
00:01:23.45 --> 00:01:27.140
reached ships two companies are

41
00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.210
currently developing a project called

42
00:01:27.14 --> 00:01:31.430
Tesla over the seas its goal is to

43
00:01:29.21 --> 00:01:33.470
launch the first autonomous ship that's

44
00:01:31.43 --> 00:01:35.810
powered by electric batteries

45
00:01:33.47 --> 00:01:37.369
the first yara berkland the formal name

46
00:01:35.81 --> 00:01:40.700
of the project it's expected to be ready

47
00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.530
by the end of 2018 and this might all

48
00:01:40.7 --> 00:01:44.450
leave you wondering well what's Norway's

49
00:01:42.53 --> 00:01:46.970
secrets how on earth if they made

50
00:01:44.45 --> 00:01:49.340
electric cars quite so popular is it

51
00:01:46.97 --> 00:01:51.549
really all to do about just concern for

52
00:01:49.34 --> 00:01:51.549
the environment

53
00:01:53.38 --> 00:01:57.850
well yeah I mean maybe that is a part of

54
00:01:55.93 --> 00:01:59.500
it but if we're honest the majority

55
00:01:57.85 --> 00:02:02.259
reason well it's a little less

56
00:01:59.5 --> 00:02:04.570
idealistic the key for this electric car

57
00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.399
boom it's got everything to do with the

58
00:02:04.57 --> 00:02:08.350
tax incentives that the government has

59
00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.390
granted in order to support the industry

60
00:02:08.35 --> 00:02:12.040
so look here in Norway when you choose

61
00:02:10.39 --> 00:02:13.989
to buy a vehicle you can actually save

62
00:02:12.04 --> 00:02:16.330
an enormous amount in taxes if you

63
00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.730
choose to go for an electric vehicle for

64
00:02:16.33 --> 00:02:21.010
instance for one you do not pay any v80

65
00:02:18.73 --> 00:02:22.720
and in Norway that's 25 percent right

66
00:02:21.01 --> 00:02:24.700
off the bat you also don't have to pay

67
00:02:22.72 --> 00:02:26.860
any registration fees or any other

68
00:02:24.7 --> 00:02:28.510
additional taxes alright so this all

69
00:02:26.86 --> 00:02:31.590
sounds well and good but what is the

70
00:02:28.51 --> 00:02:34.120
actual results of this all financially

71
00:02:31.59 --> 00:02:36.880
so according to a recent study you got

72
00:02:34.12 --> 00:02:39.310
this car the Tesla Model S now if this

73
00:02:36.88 --> 00:02:40.780
was a regular gas car if you included

74
00:02:39.31 --> 00:02:42.100
all the taxes and everything else this

75
00:02:40.78 --> 00:02:43.959
thing in Norway is going to set you back

76
00:02:42.1 --> 00:02:46.299
about a hundred and forty thousand

77
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.040
dollars but thanks to the tax relief of

78
00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.930
the Norwegian government this price is

79
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:53.110
actually around seventy thousand dollars

80
00:02:49.93 --> 00:02:55.620
which is 50 percent in savings switch is

81
00:02:53.11 --> 00:02:57.870
pretty amazing

82
00:02:55.62 --> 00:02:59.489
and that's not even mentioning the other

83
00:02:57.87 --> 00:03:01.290
advantages I mean these cars they don't

84
00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.180
have to pay for any tolls and they don't

85
00:03:01.29 --> 00:03:04.709
have to pay parking meters well so

86
00:03:03.18 --> 00:03:06.540
there's another major advantage because

87
00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.610
in Norway electricity it's mostly

88
00:03:06.54 --> 00:03:10.709
hydroelectric which means well it's both

89
00:03:08.61 --> 00:03:12.660
cheap and it's clean all right so as a

90
00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.980
result of these policies and some other

91
00:03:12.66 --> 00:03:16.560
policies the government expects to

92
00:03:13.98 --> 00:03:18.540
reduce total carbon emissions by 40

93
00:03:16.56 --> 00:03:19.590
percent in the next few years all right

94
00:03:18.54 --> 00:03:21.000
so if you consider all of these

95
00:03:19.59 --> 00:03:23.280
advantages like being able to get a

96
00:03:21.0 --> 00:03:24.599
Tesla for 70 grands and the fact that it

97
00:03:23.28 --> 00:03:25.140
has one of the highest living standards

98
00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.640
in the world

99
00:03:25.14 --> 00:03:28.319
you might be thinking right now well

100
00:03:26.64 --> 00:03:29.940
Norway sounds like a pretty amazing

101
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.200
place but taking things back to the

102
00:03:29.94 --> 00:03:33.630
environment for a minute the Norwegian

103
00:03:31.2 --> 00:03:36.349
Constitution it even actually protects

104
00:03:33.63 --> 00:03:38.730
the environment consider article 110

105
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.560
every person has a right to an

106
00:03:38.73 --> 00:03:42.030
environment that is conducive to health

107
00:03:40.56 --> 00:03:43.650
and to a natural environment whose

108
00:03:42.03 --> 00:03:45.540
productivity and diversity are

109
00:03:43.65 --> 00:03:47.250
maintained natural resources should be

110
00:03:45.54 --> 00:03:49.470
managed on the basis of comprehensive

111
00:03:47.25 --> 00:03:51.569
long-term considerations whereby this

112
00:03:49.47 --> 00:03:55.170
right will be safeguarded for future

113
00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.599
generations as well article 110 B of

114
00:03:55.17 --> 00:03:59.639
Norway's constitution all right so as

115
00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.220
always in one of these videos not

116
00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.880
everything is sunshine lollipops and

117
00:04:02.22 --> 00:04:05.069
rainbows

118
00:04:02.88 --> 00:04:07.079
so Norway is this really wealthy country

119
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.230
and they've got this really big welfare

120
00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.120
state but they do have a small issue or

121
00:04:10.23 --> 00:04:14.910
at least a problem that makes Greenpeace

122
00:04:12.12 --> 00:04:17.940
really angry and this issue it is about

123
00:04:14.91 --> 00:04:19.739
the oil production of Norway but now the

124
00:04:17.94 --> 00:04:22.410
question really has to become I mean how

125
00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.060
oil dependent is Norway well let's have

126
00:04:22.41 --> 00:04:26.380
a look at that

127
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:29.270
[Music]

128
00:04:26.38 --> 00:04:31.860
oil addicts

129
00:04:29.27 --> 00:04:33.539
if we could take a time machine back to

130
00:04:31.86 --> 00:04:35.789
the beginning of the 20th century we

131
00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.979
would find Norway with a really basic

132
00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.469
economy all they did was fishing fishing

133
00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.240
and fishing now if we traveled forward

134
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.550
in time even though things did improve

135
00:04:42.24 --> 00:04:46.710
significantly Norway during the 1960's

136
00:04:44.55 --> 00:04:48.599
was in no way included in the list of

137
00:04:46.71 --> 00:04:50.430
the world's wealthiest countries not at

138
00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:53.399
all in fact its per capita income was

139
00:04:50.43 --> 00:04:54.719
around half of Switzerland's 1960 the

140
00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:57.300
standard of living in Norway was about

141
00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:59.129
30 or 40 percent lower than in Sweden or

142
00:04:57.3 --> 00:05:00.899
in Denmark now the standard of living in

143
00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.819
Norway is substantially higher that'd

144
00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.439
those two countries bruno gerard an

145
00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.539
economist at the norwegian business

146
00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.430
school in oslo so now the obvious

147
00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.139
question becomes but what happens now

148
00:05:08.43 --> 00:05:12.449
how did it become one of the richest

149
00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.399
countries on earth in so little time

150
00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.309
well everything it began to change in

151
00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.949
the year 1969 this was the year when the

152
00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.899
first oil reserves were found and since

153
00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.249
then well it's been a bit of a golden

154
00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:25.080
age the country became one of the

155
00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.360
world's largest oil and natural gas

156
00:05:25.08 --> 00:05:29.939
suppliers as you can imagine this oil

157
00:05:27.36 --> 00:05:32.129
revolution means tons of money coming in

158
00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:37.469
money that contributed to building of

159
00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:39.959
the Norway that we know today today oil

160
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.509
and natural gas are the keys of this

161
00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:44.550
country's economy in 2016 for instance

162
00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.620
almost 40% of exports of more than a

163
00:05:44.55 --> 00:05:48.659
fifth of investment had its origin in

164
00:05:46.62 --> 00:05:50.279
the oil and gas sector and of course I

165
00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.889
mean the government it's getting its

166
00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.719
share like depending on the year and the

167
00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.339
prices of gas and all the income that

168
00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.379
the government obtains from this

169
00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.599
industry varies from one of every four

170
00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:03.180
to one of every six euros of the

171
00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.289
government's total tax collection and so

172
00:06:03.18 --> 00:06:06.180
what a government gets a ton of money

173
00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.790
well that usually means an increase in

174
00:06:06.18 --> 00:06:09.680
public spending

175
00:06:07.79 --> 00:06:11.990
world's most generous welfare state

176
00:06:09.68 --> 00:06:14.150
leaves 20% on the door yeah that's

177
00:06:11.99 --> 00:06:16.220
absolutely right to a certain extent we

178
00:06:14.15 --> 00:06:18.050
could say the Norwegian model of a huge

179
00:06:16.22 --> 00:06:20.420
welfare state with public control of

180
00:06:18.05 --> 00:06:21.710
many of the large companies has a lot to

181
00:06:20.42 --> 00:06:23.270
do with oil

182
00:06:21.71 --> 00:06:24.920
however the tumbling of all of the price

183
00:06:23.27 --> 00:06:26.570
of this raw material has led the

184
00:06:24.92 --> 00:06:28.670
government to take an incredibly

185
00:06:26.57 --> 00:06:30.380
controversial measure for the first time

186
00:06:28.67 --> 00:06:33.500
in 20 years the Norwegian government its

187
00:06:30.38 --> 00:06:35.210
granting new exploration licenses in

188
00:06:33.5 --> 00:06:37.070
particular 10 new instances of oil

189
00:06:35.21 --> 00:06:40.480
exploration in the Barents Sea in the

190
00:06:37.07 --> 00:06:40.480
heart of the Arctic Circle

191
00:06:40.64 --> 00:06:43.730
[Music]

192
00:06:45.82 --> 00:06:49.960
and the truth is this movement has made

193
00:06:48.31 --> 00:06:52.810
Greenpeace in other environments and

194
00:06:49.96 --> 00:06:54.280
organizations really really angry great

195
00:06:52.81 --> 00:06:55.660
these by the way they've taken the

196
00:06:54.28 --> 00:06:57.790
government to court accusing them of

197
00:06:55.66 --> 00:06:59.920
violating the Paris agreements and also

198
00:06:57.79 --> 00:07:02.110
violating the Norwegian Constitution

199
00:06:59.92 --> 00:07:03.280
itself as we just told you moments ago

200
00:07:02.11 --> 00:07:05.950
the environment it's pretty well

201
00:07:03.28 --> 00:07:08.260
protected in Norwegian law but the thing

202
00:07:05.95 --> 00:07:11.290
is Norway's Green commitments well

203
00:07:08.26 --> 00:07:13.060
there's certain limitations Norway has

204
00:07:11.29 --> 00:07:15.130
set out to be a global leader in climate

205
00:07:13.06 --> 00:07:16.900
action yet continued expansion of oil

206
00:07:15.13 --> 00:07:18.820
and gas production could eclipse the

207
00:07:16.9 --> 00:07:21.010
benefits of Norway's domestic emission

208
00:07:18.82 --> 00:07:22.720
reductions efforts Peter Eriksen a

209
00:07:21.01 --> 00:07:24.640
senior scientist within the Stockholm

210
00:07:22.72 --> 00:07:26.050
environment Institute and well the

211
00:07:24.64 --> 00:07:29.320
reality is that the world's largest

212
00:07:26.05 --> 00:07:32.620
welfare state it certainly does not come

213
00:07:29.32 --> 00:07:34.540
cheap we as a country are petrol holux

214
00:07:32.62 --> 00:07:36.640
we depend so much on the income from the

215
00:07:34.54 --> 00:07:38.500
oil just like alcoholics we want to stop

216
00:07:36.64 --> 00:07:40.090
but we don't know how thomas nielsen

217
00:07:38.5 --> 00:07:41.920
editor of the independent Arendt's

218
00:07:40.09 --> 00:07:44.410
observer but but wait for a minute

219
00:07:41.92 --> 00:07:46.060
because it is not like Norway is lie

220
00:07:44.41 --> 00:07:48.700
some of those other countries they also

221
00:07:46.06 --> 00:07:50.950
rely on oil absolutely not

222
00:07:48.7 --> 00:07:52.960
Norway is dependent on oil to a certain

223
00:07:50.95 --> 00:07:55.480
extent but it's not even close to how

224
00:07:52.96 --> 00:07:58.000
dependent Venezuela or Saudi Arabia are

225
00:07:55.48 --> 00:07:59.320
honest in Norway thinks they are totally

226
00:07:58.0 --> 00:08:01.150
different now although the government

227
00:07:59.32 --> 00:08:03.370
does carry a lot of economic weight

228
00:08:01.15 --> 00:08:05.110
Norway has tried to be open to business

229
00:08:03.37 --> 00:08:07.450
and they have tried to use this oil

230
00:08:05.11 --> 00:08:10.120
money to fund productive activities and

231
00:08:07.45 --> 00:08:13.970
provide a quality education they have

232
00:08:10.12 --> 00:08:15.710
also been incredibly committed to saving

233
00:08:13.97 --> 00:08:20.280
[Music]

234
00:08:15.71 --> 00:08:21.930
the fund of funds for a country that has

235
00:08:20.28 --> 00:08:24.210
made so much money with the oil industry

236
00:08:21.93 --> 00:08:26.100
Norway is very different to what we are

237
00:08:24.21 --> 00:08:28.530
used to Oslo the capital city it's not

238
00:08:26.1 --> 00:08:30.840
overtaken by skyscrapers massive malls

239
00:08:28.53 --> 00:08:32.280
extravagant complexes now don't get me

240
00:08:30.84 --> 00:08:33.900
wrong they have spent a lot of money but

241
00:08:32.28 --> 00:08:35.940
the key to Norway is that they haven't

242
00:08:33.9 --> 00:08:37.590
wasted it with a Norwegian government

243
00:08:35.94 --> 00:08:39.450
they make this really sensible decision

244
00:08:37.59 --> 00:08:41.160
they decided to save a lot of their oil

245
00:08:39.45 --> 00:08:42.960
money they set up a sovereign wealth

246
00:08:41.16 --> 00:08:45.510
funds a to invest the money and buy

247
00:08:42.96 --> 00:08:48.060
assets all around the globe and this is

248
00:08:45.51 --> 00:08:50.730
the biggest sovereign wealth fund on

249
00:08:48.06 --> 00:08:53.340
earth not even Saudi Arabia not even

250
00:08:50.73 --> 00:08:56.220
Kuwait have saved so much now consider

251
00:08:53.34 --> 00:08:58.560
this Norway's sovereign wealth fund hits

252
00:08:56.22 --> 00:09:00.420
one trillion dollars yes that's that's

253
00:08:58.56 --> 00:09:02.490
absolutely right that's a trillion

254
00:09:00.42 --> 00:09:04.740
dollars this is a fortune of around one

255
00:09:02.49 --> 00:09:06.450
hundred and ninety thousand dollars per

256
00:09:04.74 --> 00:09:08.520
Norwegian citizen instead of wasting

257
00:09:06.45 --> 00:09:10.200
this money they invested it in companies

258
00:09:08.52 --> 00:09:11.880
all around the world this fund is

259
00:09:10.2 --> 00:09:14.430
invested money in more than 9,000

260
00:09:11.88 --> 00:09:16.590
companies in 78 countries some of these

261
00:09:14.43 --> 00:09:18.420
companies really famous your Apple

262
00:09:16.59 --> 00:09:20.460
Nestle shell alphabet that's better

263
00:09:18.42 --> 00:09:22.770
known as Google yeah indeed we could say

264
00:09:20.46 --> 00:09:25.110
that the Norwegians well they even own a

265
00:09:22.77 --> 00:09:27.150
part of YouTube and you know what one of

266
00:09:25.11 --> 00:09:30.150
their targets is to eventually replace

267
00:09:27.15 --> 00:09:32.250
their oil income with income from these

268
00:09:30.15 --> 00:09:34.350
investments I mean these are investments

269
00:09:32.25 --> 00:09:36.600
they produce prophetís what they do and

270
00:09:34.35 --> 00:09:39.390
these profits have been a return of

271
00:09:36.6 --> 00:09:40.680
about 5.7 percent a year so if these

272
00:09:39.39 --> 00:09:42.900
levels have returned must be kept the

273
00:09:40.68 --> 00:09:44.940
same Norway would have an average of 50

274
00:09:42.9 --> 00:09:47.160
billion dollars in profit which is

275
00:09:44.94 --> 00:09:48.690
equivalent to about 25% of their public

276
00:09:47.16 --> 00:09:50.190
spending starting to sound pretty good

277
00:09:48.69 --> 00:09:51.270
right and on top of all of that of

278
00:09:50.19 --> 00:09:53.070
course there's the income that the

279
00:09:51.27 --> 00:09:54.600
government gets from oil and local

280
00:09:53.07 --> 00:09:56.670
companies companies that despite being

281
00:09:54.6 --> 00:09:58.440
state owns they do work with market

282
00:09:56.67 --> 00:09:59.850
criteria all right so it's still looking

283
00:09:58.44 --> 00:10:01.830
pretty rosy I mean you might be thinking

284
00:09:59.85 --> 00:10:03.870
right now that Norway what does it have

285
00:10:01.83 --> 00:10:05.370
to worry about but hold on for just a

286
00:10:03.87 --> 00:10:06.990
moment because their welfare level it

287
00:10:05.37 --> 00:10:08.700
does seem to have a solid base but the

288
00:10:06.99 --> 00:10:11.130
government is absolutely determined to

289
00:10:08.7 --> 00:10:12.990
achieve economic diversification in

290
00:10:11.13 --> 00:10:15.510
order to have a more competitive economy

291
00:10:12.99 --> 00:10:18.800
so that they ultimately get rid of their

292
00:10:15.51 --> 00:10:18.800
dependency on oil

293
00:10:20.63 --> 00:10:24.320
the reforms

294
00:10:24.62 --> 00:10:30.020
since 1927 the center-left party has

295
00:10:27.98 --> 00:10:32.030
been the most popular in general

296
00:10:30.02 --> 00:10:33.740
elections but in Norway absolute

297
00:10:32.03 --> 00:10:36.170
majorities they're not really common in

298
00:10:33.74 --> 00:10:38.180
2013 a coalition of center right-wing

299
00:10:36.17 --> 00:10:39.530
parties like the Progress Party famous

300
00:10:38.18 --> 00:10:42.050
for its radical position on immigration

301
00:10:39.53 --> 00:10:44.930
managed to put Erna Solberg in office

302
00:10:42.05 --> 00:10:46.760
she is known as the Norwegian version of

303
00:10:44.93 --> 00:10:48.140
Angela Merkel in the recent elections

304
00:10:46.76 --> 00:10:50.270
that happens on the 11th of September

305
00:10:48.14 --> 00:10:52.160
2017 this coalition when it was

306
00:10:50.27 --> 00:10:54.290
re-elected and the intent of this

307
00:10:52.16 --> 00:10:56.600
government is to get some distance from

308
00:10:54.29 --> 00:10:57.980
what has become known as the Norwegian

309
00:10:56.6 --> 00:10:59.420
model the government they want to

310
00:10:57.98 --> 00:11:01.790
improve the competitiveness of the

311
00:10:59.42 --> 00:11:03.860
country by reducing taxes especially for

312
00:11:01.79 --> 00:11:05.450
companies both public and private at the

313
00:11:03.86 --> 00:11:15.200
same time they also intend to keep

314
00:11:05.45 --> 00:11:17.270
developing the oil industry anyway if

315
00:11:15.2 --> 00:11:19.280
they are sure about something in Norway

316
00:11:17.27 --> 00:11:21.560
it is the innovation and developments

317
00:11:19.28 --> 00:11:23.900
are the best ways to obtain high

318
00:11:21.56 --> 00:11:25.790
standards of living and improve the

319
00:11:23.9 --> 00:11:27.440
environment so well now it is your turn

320
00:11:25.79 --> 00:11:29.240
do you think that Norway should be this

321
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:30.920
example of something to be followed in

322
00:11:29.24 --> 00:11:32.600
the management of natural resources well

323
00:11:30.92 --> 00:11:34.340
