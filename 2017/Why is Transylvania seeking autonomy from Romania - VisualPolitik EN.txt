[Music]

3
00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.300
Transylvania it's like Catalonia with

4
00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.340
vampires yes you heard that right the

5
00:00:12.3 --> 00:00:16.049
land where Dracula was born is also the

6
00:00:14.34 --> 00:00:18.930
place of one of the most significant

7
00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.880
separatist conflicts in all of Europe in

8
00:00:18.93 --> 00:00:23.010
other words Transylvania well it is the

9
00:00:20.88 --> 00:00:25.380
perfect place to make a visual politic

10
00:00:23.01 --> 00:00:28.600
Halloween special

11
00:00:25.38 --> 00:00:30.850
[Music]

12
00:00:28.6 --> 00:00:32.110
and yes yes yes we do read your comments

13
00:00:30.85 --> 00:00:34.090
we do know that you want a video about

14
00:00:32.11 --> 00:00:35.829
Catalonia and I tell you what we are

15
00:00:34.09 --> 00:00:37.930
working on it is going to be big it's

16
00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.670
going to be complicated and it's also

17
00:00:37.93 --> 00:00:41.770
going to be worth the way so I promise

18
00:00:39.67 --> 00:00:44.320
just sit tight for Catalonia but for now

19
00:00:41.77 --> 00:00:46.120
let us get back to Transylvania which is

20
00:00:44.32 --> 00:00:48.699
a historical region located in the

21
00:00:46.12 --> 00:00:51.100
centre of Romania despite being in sight

22
00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.290
Romania 20% of its population doesn't

23
00:00:51.1 --> 00:00:58.510
even speak Romanian instead their mother

24
00:00:53.29 --> 00:01:00.250
language is to be Hungarian indeed in

25
00:00:58.51 --> 00:01:02.800
some areas the number of Hungarian

26
00:01:00.25 --> 00:01:04.809
speaking people rises to 80%

27
00:01:02.8 --> 00:01:06.460
this area where the Hungarians are the

28
00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.990
majority is called The Seeker lands

29
00:01:06.46 --> 00:01:10.270
almost every year you can see the

30
00:01:07.99 --> 00:01:11.920
massive protests of ze is demanding more

31
00:01:10.27 --> 00:01:13.390
autonomy for the territory these

32
00:01:11.92 --> 00:01:15.520
demonstrations are celebrated in the

33
00:01:13.39 --> 00:01:17.289
main cities of Transylvania as well as

34
00:01:15.52 --> 00:01:19.750
Bucharest the Romanian capital and

35
00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.250
Budapest the Hungarian capital but hold

36
00:01:19.75 --> 00:01:23.530
on for just a minute because things are

37
00:01:21.25 --> 00:01:25.119
more complicated than they seem in fact

38
00:01:23.53 --> 00:01:27.220
see Calise don't want to have their own

39
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.860
country instead they want to become a

40
00:01:27.22 --> 00:01:32.380
special region in slative Romania with a

41
00:01:29.86 --> 00:01:34.479
very specific fiscal system so the

42
00:01:32.38 --> 00:01:36.670
question here is well why does this

43
00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.799
cause so many problems for Romania why

44
00:01:36.67 --> 00:01:41.140
aren't these demands creating such a

45
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.030
significant diplomatic conflict and well

46
00:01:41.14 --> 00:01:44.799
more importantly the question is what

47
00:01:43.03 --> 00:01:46.329
does the Hungarian governments have to

48
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.650
do with this well do you not worry

49
00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.610
because today well of course they're

50
00:01:47.65 --> 00:01:51.070
going to answer all of these questions

51
00:01:48.61 --> 00:01:53.560
but as usual before we do all of that

52
00:01:51.07 --> 00:01:55.270
let's go back and take a look at the

53
00:01:53.56 --> 00:01:56.990
history

54
00:01:55.27 --> 00:02:00.390
[Music]

55
00:01:56.99 --> 00:02:02.520
arrey times so for centuries

56
00:02:00.39 --> 00:02:04.920
Transylvania it was part of the kingdom

57
00:02:02.52 --> 00:02:06.569
of Hungary back then Romania it wasn't

58
00:02:04.92 --> 00:02:09.119
even a country the upper classes and

59
00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.860
aristocracy spoke Hungarian and Romanian

60
00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.610
it was the language spoken by the

61
00:02:10.86 --> 00:02:16.290
peasants at some points in history

62
00:02:14.61 --> 00:02:18.989
Romanian speakers were even prosecuted

63
00:02:16.29 --> 00:02:21.120
by the authorities we call this process

64
00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.160
the meteor ization basically these

65
00:02:21.12 --> 00:02:25.620
Hungarian rulers they wanted to impose

66
00:02:23.16 --> 00:02:27.209
their culture at any cost to those

67
00:02:25.62 --> 00:02:28.830
aristocrats Romanians for sort of

68
00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.900
hillbillies so you had a special love

69
00:02:28.83 --> 00:02:32.730
the steaming things and a bad sense of

70
00:02:30.9 --> 00:02:34.709
personal hygiene in fact there was even

71
00:02:32.73 --> 00:02:37.470
a term to refer to these Romanians they

72
00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.360
were called Horus yel vu this literally

73
00:02:37.47 --> 00:02:41.360
means with a hairy tongue

74
00:02:43.36 --> 00:02:47.060
so during the 19th century the

75
00:02:45.62 --> 00:02:49.340
government closed rainy and speaking

76
00:02:47.06 --> 00:02:51.440
newspapers and they even forced a lot of

77
00:02:49.34 --> 00:02:53.150
citizens to change their Romanian name

78
00:02:51.44 --> 00:02:54.710
to a Hungarian one

79
00:02:53.15 --> 00:02:56.150
despite this well after World War one

80
00:02:54.71 --> 00:02:58.490
things they really changed the

81
00:02:56.15 --> 00:03:00.050
austro-hungarian Empire lost the war and

82
00:02:58.49 --> 00:03:02.210
one of the things that happens when you

83
00:03:00.05 --> 00:03:04.190
lose war is you usually lose a part of

84
00:03:02.21 --> 00:03:05.780
your territory one of those parts well

85
00:03:04.19 --> 00:03:08.240
that was Transylvania which was

86
00:03:05.78 --> 00:03:09.920
incorporated into Romanian suddenly

87
00:03:08.24 --> 00:03:12.170
these peasants that were oppressed by

88
00:03:09.92 --> 00:03:14.690
the hungarian nobility they had power

89
00:03:12.17 --> 00:03:17.000
and with the power well they wanted

90
00:03:14.69 --> 00:03:18.770
revenge and this is how the first

91
00:03:17.0 --> 00:03:22.540
attempts to destroy the Hungarian

92
00:03:18.77 --> 00:03:22.540
culture well that's how they started

93
00:03:25.42 --> 00:03:31.060
and well it certainly wasn't an easy job

94
00:03:28.42 --> 00:03:33.459
did not forget the despite being a part

95
00:03:31.06 --> 00:03:36.550
of Romania Transylvania was the home of

96
00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.290
over 1 million Hungarian speaking people

97
00:03:36.55 --> 00:03:40.000
these people they were called the C

98
00:03:38.29 --> 00:03:41.800
Cleese and for generations they have

99
00:03:40.0 --> 00:03:44.380
been speaking the language of istvÃ¡n or

100
00:03:41.8 --> 00:03:50.020
kane' but things they got a whole lot

101
00:03:44.38 --> 00:03:51.940
uglier during World War two hungary well

102
00:03:50.02 --> 00:03:54.160
they once again chose the wrong side to

103
00:03:51.94 --> 00:03:56.170
ally with with hitler's help they took

104
00:03:54.16 --> 00:03:57.970
back their former territories and struck

105
00:03:56.17 --> 00:03:59.950
back against those who wanted to erase

106
00:03:57.97 --> 00:04:01.840
Hungarian culture in the country as you

107
00:03:59.95 --> 00:04:05.200
might imagine this helped to make the

108
00:04:01.84 --> 00:04:07.390
Romanians even more angry then in 1945

109
00:04:05.2 --> 00:04:08.980
well the Germans they lost the war that

110
00:04:07.39 --> 00:04:11.319
meant of course that Ally is also lost

111
00:04:08.98 --> 00:04:13.299
and that included the Hungarians so

112
00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.250
Romania with a brand new communist

113
00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.979
governments well they took Transylvania

114
00:04:15.25 --> 00:04:19.380
back this time though they had an even

115
00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.480
bigger taste for payback

116
00:04:19.38 --> 00:04:25.400
[Music]

117
00:04:23.48 --> 00:04:27.200
so make me remember this other video

118
00:04:25.4 --> 00:04:29.690
where I told you about the dictatorship

119
00:04:27.2 --> 00:04:31.400
of Nicolae Ceausescu if you've seen it

120
00:04:29.69 --> 00:04:33.080
you already know that the communist

121
00:04:31.4 --> 00:04:35.690
Romania well it was the closest thing to

122
00:04:33.08 --> 00:04:37.910
a European North Korea that existed one

123
00:04:35.69 --> 00:04:39.800
in every 30 Romanians was a part of the

124
00:04:37.91 --> 00:04:41.270
political police and so they prosecuted

125
00:04:39.8 --> 00:04:43.340
not only those who opposed the

126
00:04:41.27 --> 00:04:45.860
government but even those who dared to

127
00:04:43.34 --> 00:04:48.200
speak Hungarian from one day to the

128
00:04:45.86 --> 00:04:49.940
other Chesky closed newspapers and

129
00:04:48.2 --> 00:04:52.210
forced those securities to speak

130
00:04:49.94 --> 00:04:55.990
Romanian even in their own homes

131
00:04:52.21 --> 00:04:59.480
[Music]

132
00:04:55.99 --> 00:05:01.180
major ization bad as it was forced a few

133
00:04:59.48 --> 00:05:03.260
Romanians to change their names

134
00:05:01.18 --> 00:05:06.620
romanization it's the same sort of thing

135
00:05:03.26 --> 00:05:08.150
just on a way bigger scale but holds on

136
00:05:06.62 --> 00:05:09.980
for just a moment because it still

137
00:05:08.15 --> 00:05:12.260
doesn't stop here on their path to

138
00:05:09.98 --> 00:05:14.570
destroy even the last resemblance of

139
00:05:12.26 --> 00:05:16.610
Hungarian culture the Romanian Communist

140
00:05:14.57 --> 00:05:18.650
Party forced thousands of citizens to

141
00:05:16.61 --> 00:05:21.020
set up in the Hungarian speaking

142
00:05:18.65 --> 00:05:22.610
territories this way Hungarian speaking

143
00:05:21.02 --> 00:05:25.070
became a small minority in cities like

144
00:05:22.61 --> 00:05:26.780
or dare or satyr mari basically the

145
00:05:25.07 --> 00:05:28.820
whole area that borders with Hungary

146
00:05:26.78 --> 00:05:30.770
became a Romanian majority region

147
00:05:28.82 --> 00:05:32.330
despite all of this there is a region

148
00:05:30.77 --> 00:05:34.430
that did manage to keep their language

149
00:05:32.33 --> 00:05:38.440
and traditions intact Aslam we mentioned

150
00:05:34.43 --> 00:05:38.440
earlier it's the so called C collapse

151
00:05:40.27 --> 00:05:46.460
Romania steals from us so in 1991

152
00:05:43.91 --> 00:05:48.500
Romania passed this brand-new democratic

153
00:05:46.46 --> 00:05:50.780
constitution the constitution recognized

154
00:05:48.5 --> 00:05:52.520
the right to speak Hungarian but as you

155
00:05:50.78 --> 00:05:54.710
can imagine after decades of hate

156
00:05:52.52 --> 00:06:02.360
against Budapest those seekers they were

157
00:05:54.71 --> 00:06:04.610
far from happy think about it I mean

158
00:06:02.36 --> 00:06:07.039
fiscally Romania it's a very centralized

159
00:06:04.61 --> 00:06:08.599
country almost all the taxes are

160
00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.849
collected by the central government and

161
00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.530
then they share that money among the

162
00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.889
regions where they focus on the poorest

163
00:06:12.53 --> 00:06:15.440
ones

164
00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.690
this puts Transylvania in a pretty bad

165
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:19.300
position and that's because well they

166
00:06:17.69 --> 00:06:23.980
are one of the wealthiest regions

167
00:06:19.3 --> 00:06:23.980
[Music]

168
00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:30.219
and so well this is how a new political

169
00:06:28.27 --> 00:06:32.080
party was born and that would be the

170
00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.469
Democratic Alliance of Hungarians of

171
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:36.339
Romania also known as you DMR

172
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.749
unsurprisingly they want all the

173
00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:40.509
elections in the regions where

174
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:42.279
Hungarians are the majority so well what

175
00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.379
are their foundations well basically

176
00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.629
they claim that Romania is essentially

177
00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.129
sucking their lifeblood their money yeah

178
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.110
it's pretty much the same situation as

179
00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.629
in Catalonia and their solutions you

180
00:06:50.11 --> 00:06:54.490
ends this Romanian looting is imitating

181
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.589
the fiscal model of a nother Spanish

182
00:06:54.49 --> 00:06:58.599
region and that would be Basque Country

183
00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:00.729
unlike other regions the bass citizens

184
00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.000
don't pay their taxes 200 but to their

185
00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:04.759
local government instead

186
00:07:02.0 --> 00:07:06.919
[Music]

187
00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.659
once the money is collected the local

188
00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.610
government has to give some share to the

189
00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:11.990
central government but the rest is to be

190
00:07:10.61 --> 00:07:13.729
managed the way the local government

191
00:07:11.99 --> 00:07:16.699
wants so this was the system that was

192
00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.499
proposed by the seekers in 2014 and

193
00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.449
guess what the Romanian government

194
00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:21.770
replies well they said it was against

195
00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.389
the Constitution the Romanian

196
00:07:21.77 --> 00:07:25.539
Constitution starts off by saying that

197
00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.309
it is a sovereign unitary and

198
00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:30.289
indivisible country now of course this

199
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:31.789
is something that created a whole lot of

200
00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:33.680
protests in a whole lot of different

201
00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:35.479
cities there were referendum attempts

202
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:37.639
and all sorts of other symbolic

203
00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.560
objections and these are all things that

204
00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:42.880
really hurt the Romanian ruling class

205
00:07:39.56 --> 00:07:45.200
[Music]

206
00:07:42.88 --> 00:07:47.420
Romania's ruling party threatens

207
00:07:45.2 --> 00:07:49.490
autonomy seeking Transylvanian

208
00:07:47.42 --> 00:07:50.660
Hungarians with printers and Punishment

209
00:07:49.49 --> 00:07:52.670
attempts that threaten the

210
00:07:50.66 --> 00:07:54.380
constitutional order of Romania should

211
00:07:52.67 --> 00:07:55.910
be punished with prison if you've been

212
00:07:54.38 --> 00:07:57.500
following the case of the castle alien

213
00:07:55.91 --> 00:07:59.720
separatists well this might sound pretty

214
00:07:57.5 --> 00:08:01.790
familiar to you but hold on just a

215
00:07:59.72 --> 00:08:07.100
second because well the best it's yet to

216
00:08:01.79 --> 00:08:08.480
come autonomy or annexation if any of

217
00:08:07.1 --> 00:08:10.310
you have ever been so hungry I'm sure

218
00:08:08.48 --> 00:08:12.650
you might have seen someone wearing this

219
00:08:10.31 --> 00:08:14.900
t-shirt with this map it represents the

220
00:08:12.65 --> 00:08:16.820
shape of Hungary before losing a part of

221
00:08:14.9 --> 00:08:19.250
their territories before World War one

222
00:08:16.82 --> 00:08:21.110
yeah even today in the 21st century a

223
00:08:19.25 --> 00:08:23.570
lot of Hungarians keep dreaming about

224
00:08:21.11 --> 00:08:25.280
taking their old empire back and among

225
00:08:23.57 --> 00:08:29.360
them you'll find the presidents Viktor

226
00:08:25.28 --> 00:08:32.070
Orban the Vladimir Putin of the Danube

227
00:08:29.36 --> 00:08:34.110
just like the Russian president Albin is

228
00:08:32.07 --> 00:08:36.150
famous for prosecuting journalists who

229
00:08:34.11 --> 00:08:38.220
dare to criticize him he has passed

230
00:08:36.15 --> 00:08:40.800
anti-gay laws and he wins elections with

231
00:08:38.22 --> 00:08:42.840
60% of the votes and of course like

232
00:08:40.8 --> 00:08:45.150
every good Putin Astorga n-- likes to

233
00:08:42.84 --> 00:08:48.630
rule not only his own country but others

234
00:08:45.15 --> 00:08:50.490
too war bond supports the autonomy of

235
00:08:48.63 --> 00:08:51.720
the say Kelly's ahright ahright ahright

236
00:08:50.49 --> 00:08:53.610
and all your thinking why does a

237
00:08:51.72 --> 00:08:55.650
president from another country mess with

238
00:08:53.61 --> 00:08:57.540
the internal politics of another I mean

239
00:08:55.65 --> 00:08:59.760
at the end of the day what the Seekers

240
00:08:57.54 --> 00:09:01.950
want is just to have more autonomy but

241
00:08:59.76 --> 00:09:04.260
without leaving Romania right well in

242
00:09:01.95 --> 00:09:08.550
fact those Sica citizens are also his

243
00:09:04.26 --> 00:09:10.620
citizens Hungary grant citizenship

244
00:09:08.55 --> 00:09:11.400
rights to ethnic Hungarians abroad yeah

245
00:09:10.62 --> 00:09:12.990
you heard that right

246
00:09:11.4 --> 00:09:15.120
all of those Transylvanian born

247
00:09:12.99 --> 00:09:16.860
Hungarians they have two passports that

248
00:09:15.12 --> 00:09:18.420
the right to study in Hungary and of

249
00:09:16.86 --> 00:09:20.580
course they care to vote in Hungarian

250
00:09:18.42 --> 00:09:21.690
elections this last thing well it's

251
00:09:20.58 --> 00:09:23.850
pretty good for them

252
00:09:21.69 --> 00:09:27.090
I mean he's popular inside of Hungarian

253
00:09:23.85 --> 00:09:27.480
borders but outside he absolutely steals

254
00:09:27.09 --> 00:09:29.280
the show

255
00:09:27.48 --> 00:09:31.470
ninety-five percent of Hungarians from

256
00:09:29.28 --> 00:09:33.900
abroad voted for his party at the latest

257
00:09:31.47 --> 00:09:35.400
legislative elections meanwhile Romania

258
00:09:33.9 --> 00:09:37.050
considers these rights for the seekers

259
00:09:35.4 --> 00:09:39.740
as a complete violation of their own

260
00:09:37.05 --> 00:09:39.740
sovereignty

261
00:09:40.9 --> 00:09:45.110
in their opinion if you vote in two

262
00:09:43.25 --> 00:09:47.690
different countries you can't be loyal

263
00:09:45.11 --> 00:09:49.220
to the one way you live all this means

264
00:09:47.69 --> 00:09:51.890
that diplomatic relations between

265
00:09:49.22 --> 00:09:52.910
Hungary and Romania are pretty darn

266
00:09:51.89 --> 00:09:55.010
complicated

267
00:09:52.91 --> 00:09:57.080
thanks to this Albin can use Romania as

268
00:09:55.01 --> 00:09:59.300
an antagonist to his nationalist

269
00:09:57.08 --> 00:10:00.650
propaganda and then Romania well he gets

270
00:09:59.3 --> 00:10:02.000
a great chance to give some to

271
00:10:00.65 --> 00:10:04.660
hungry when it comes to European

272
00:10:02.0 --> 00:10:04.660
politics

273
00:10:04.99 --> 00:10:08.900
so now this probably leads you on to the

274
00:10:07.49 --> 00:10:10.760
question of well what's the European

275
00:10:08.9 --> 00:10:12.950
Union think about all of this the truth

276
00:10:10.76 --> 00:10:14.720
is despite the Council of Europe writing

277
00:10:12.95 --> 00:10:16.220
memorandums where they defend the rights

278
00:10:14.72 --> 00:10:17.990
of ethnic minorities Brussels would

279
00:10:16.22 --> 00:10:19.960
never let Hungary win at the end of the

280
00:10:17.99 --> 00:10:22.250
day Viktor Orban is like the Dracula

281
00:10:19.96 --> 00:10:24.260
Frankenstein and Freddy Krueger of

282
00:10:22.25 --> 00:10:26.000
European politics so as long as things

283
00:10:24.26 --> 00:10:28.460
don't turn ugly don't expect any

284
00:10:26.0 --> 00:10:31.090
position from any EU institution or

285
00:10:28.46 --> 00:10:31.090
politician

286
00:10:32.31 --> 00:10:35.730
but this is what we think your official

287
00:10:34.26 --> 00:10:36.990
politic and now we'd love to know what

288
00:10:35.73 --> 00:10:39.000
you think do you think Transylvania

289
00:10:36.99 --> 00:10:40.140
should have its own autonomy or perhaps

290
00:10:39.0 --> 00:10:41.940
this is nothing that's an attempt by

291
00:10:40.14 --> 00:10:44.040
Hungary to get some sway back on their

292
00:10:41.94 --> 00:10:46.080
former territories well leave your

293
