1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
this video is gonna be special we're

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,750
gonna talk about military industry a

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,850
very controversial topic where it's easy

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,849
to make sensationalist contents you try

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,460
and create outrage and get a lot of

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,590
clicks many might think that by talking

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,719
about this we're promoting the military

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,210
or the other way rounds but we're just

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,670
doing what we always do a visual politic

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,800
we're telling you the facts so you can

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,740
create your own opinions so well let's

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,870
get on with it shall we

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,409
[Applause]

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,780
[Music]

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,370
America is the world's biggest army but

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,260
you already know this what you probably

17
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,020
don't know is just how big it is to put

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,760
it into perspective each year the White

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,309
House spends more on defense than the

20
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,460
whole of Poland's GDP maybe this doesn't

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,590
surprise you think about this Poland is

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,269
a European country with almost 40

23
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,400
million inhabitants if we calculate the

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,199
value of everything these 40 million

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,280
people produced in 2019 we have around

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,110
560 billion dollars but this very same

27
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,940
year America spent ninety billion

28
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,660
dollars more on its army alone yes we're

29
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,259
talking about 649 billion dollars every

30
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:18,490
single year not blown away yet well

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,220
listen to this China with four times the

32
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,110
population of the US has the world's

33
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,479
second largest army but they spend less

34
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,479
than a quarter of what America does so

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,490
you might wonder well where does all

36
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,899
this money go the truth is that

37
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,000
defending your homeland is not a cheap

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
business for example the tank you see on

39
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,050
the screen now is an m1 Abrams and each

40
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,920
unit costs six million dollars

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,030
[Music]

42
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,770
but all in a minute because tanks are

43
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,050
pretty much the cheapest toys in this

44
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,550
industry if you want to get a

45
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,500
state-of-the-art combat jet like the

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,380
f-35 it's going to cost you a hundred

47
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,600
million dollars but this isn't just

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,210
about tanks and combat jets just think

49
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,880
of a soldier one of the soldiers that I

50
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,070
live on any American military base with

51
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,869
his or her camouflage night-vision

52
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,110
goggles and a gun how much money do you

53
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,850
think they're wearing thousand dollars

54
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,300
to thousands well get ready for this the

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,640
equipment for a normal average soldier

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,820
in America is worth ten thousand dollars

57
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,980
and I might wonder what is this normal

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,050
do other countries spends the same

59
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,880
amount on their armies Oh to make a

60
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,100
comparison a soldier in Morocco wears

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,640
just five hundred or a thousand dollars

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,840
[Music]

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,700
as you can see we're talking about a

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,920
serious industry here an industry that

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,250
employs 1.5 million people some work for

66
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,560
the army and some work for the many many

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,410
companies creating weapons for America

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,050
and yes this is a great business for

69
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,330
many so the big question is does America

70
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,849
really need such an expensive army at

71
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,489
the end of the day America is not at war

72
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,590
with any big power so shouldn't they be

73
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,390
spending their money on something else

74
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,300
like health care or education or maybe

75
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,700
even just lowering taxes also is the

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,709
military business really profitable well

77
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,000
today we're going to answer all of these

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,660
questions but before we do as always

79
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,100
let's take a look back at the history

80
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,170
[Music]

81
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,120
and many of you might think that Uncle

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,099
Sam has always been crazy about the

83
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,410
military but the truth is in the 1930s

84
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,569
the American army was no bigger than the

85
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:32,640
Portuguese army in fact during the first

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,590
half of the 19th century private armies

87
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,420
dominated the defense landscape in

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,069
America businessmen would hire

89
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,930
mercenaries to protect their properties

90
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,970
from the natives but the White House

91
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,280
felt pretty confident that nobody would

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,350
invade them after all they had natural

93
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,269
protection the Atlantic Ocean on one

94
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,609
side and the Pacific on the other they

95
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,470
obviously thought well why would we need

96
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,079
a ground Arni and this is when the first

97
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,180
man of our story enters the picture

98
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,680
Alfred Thayer Americans must now begin

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,319
to look outward the growing production

100
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,750
of the country demands it Alfred Thayer

101
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,930
Mahan captain

102
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,209
the American army during the secession

103
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,430
the so-called mayhem doctrine said that

104
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,769
the USA had to become a naval leader so

105
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,389
that they could control the main choke

106
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,459
points of international trade this way

107
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,139
America could easily become a superpower

108
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,449
and from then on well the White House

109
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,090
started spending big on its Navy but

110
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,210
only on the Navy yep America was one of

111
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,710
the first countries do you have aircraft

112
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,660
carriers and stuff like that but their

113
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,820
ground army was still really nothing

114
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,350
impressive after World War two America

115
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,630
developed a groundbreaking technology

116
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,090
the nuclear bomb and they thought this

117
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,470
was enough for other countries to

118
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,780
respect him having nukes would obviously

119
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,850
be a pretty big deterrent against

120
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,889
invasion right well things change

121
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:58,870
dramatically in the 1950s June 24th 1950

122
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,940
State Department officials said Saturday

123
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,620
night that the United States will hold

124
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,050
Russia responsible for the Communist

125
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,550
North Korea attack against the

126
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,340
independent South Korean Republic yes

127
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,380
the Korean War had started and this was

128
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,300
a turning point in American military

129
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,340
history all of a sudden the White House

130
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,590
learns that the Soviets were arrival is

131
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,320
powerful if not more so than them they

132
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,389
also had their own nuclear technology

133
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:23,979
under well-trained army the Americans

134
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,150
had their asses kicked

135
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,430
during the first Korean battles this was

136
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,320
a clear message for Washington if they

137
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,690
could beat us in Korea why couldn't they

138
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,270
beat us in California yes the view as

139
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,070
this is the moment when the then

140
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,289
President Dwight Eisenhower changed the

141
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,930
military doctrine of his country forever

142
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,830
this was the moments of thee

143
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,279
[Music]

144
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,629
deterrence strategy you might be

145
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,520
surprised but during World War one Sol

146
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,189
mommies fought on horseback with sauce

147
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,559
back then wars were about strategy and

148
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,419
vast numbers of soldiers fighting on the

149
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,610
grounds technology only played a minor

150
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,650
role all of this changed during World

151
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,020
War two the German v2 rockets were a

152
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,240
complete technological game-changer

153
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
which allowed the Germans to bomb London

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
from hundreds of miles away the same

155
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,240
happens with a Manhattan Project there

156
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,129
were more scientists surimi developments

157
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,650
of the nuclear bomb than soldiers so the

158
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,990
game changed forever it was not about

159
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,759
who had the most soldiers anymore

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,129
instead it was about who had the best

161
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,319
technology and mr. Eisenhower was the

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,900
first presidents realized this we have

163
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,339
been compelled to create a permanent

164
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,569
armaments industry of vast proportions

165
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,909
how to do this three and a half million

166
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,060
men and women are directly engaged in

167
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,389
the defense establishment we annually

168
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,809
spend on military security alone more

169
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,779
than the net income of all United States

170
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,330
cooperation corporations ironically in

171
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,949
this address the president warned his

172
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,689
successor of the potential risks are

173
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,580
spending so much on the military but it

174
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,289
was too late the military race had

175
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:03,569
already started and with it a brand new

176
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:09,730
doctrine deterrence

177
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,730
deterrents act of discouraging an action

178
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,820
or vent by instilling doubt or fear of

179
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,590
the consequences alright alright but

180
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,740
let's explain what this really means I'm

181
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,180
gonna give you an example what you see

182
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,550
here is a Spitfire a combat aircraft

183
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,290
from World War two this was made in a

184
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,210
car manufacturing facility which turned

185
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,190
into a military factory during the war

186
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,810
most of the pieces including the

187
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,030
fuselage are made with screws and pieces

188
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,800
very similar to those that automobiles

189
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,360
used at the time now this thing here

190
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,120
that's an f-86 made just ten years later

191
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,550
here we're talking about a jet that can

192
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,500
surpass the speed of sound

193
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,570
this means it needs a special fuselage

194
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,729
something you can't just build with

195
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,979
hammers and screwdrivers anymore

196
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,990
all of the component parts of this small

197
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,729
piece of art have to be made by a

198
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,590
dedicated team focused on military

199
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,900
technology so what does all of this mean

200
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,940
this means that before you could convert

201
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,280
civil factories into military ones now

202
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,300
or don't even think about it

203
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,740
in other words if you want to to tell

204
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,540
your enemies you have to be the

205
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,610
technological leader and if you want to

206
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,130
be this leader you have to invest in it

207
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,830
even in times of peace so you know that

208
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,480
video we made about a year ago where we

209
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,190
talked about Silicon Valley in that

210
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,599
video we told you how Silicon Valley

211
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,030
started as a military research complex

212
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,190
but hold on a minute because the

213
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,500
deterrence thing it goes way beyond this

214
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,520
check this out

215
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,410
[Music]

216
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,760
eternal war at the beginning of this

217
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,680
video we told you how a random American

218
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,450
soldier it's more than ten thousand

219
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,190
dollars of state-of-the-art equipment on

220
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,470
its shoulders right now I know many of

221
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,180
you thought of that moments well now

222
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,440
maybe some of you at the moment thought

223
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,240
it'd be kind of cool to see what their

224
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,460
gear is you know to try it out I mean

225
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,320
nobody likes war but it's pretty

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,940
interesting while the reality is you

227
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,380
wouldn't even know where to start each

228
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,030
soldier today must know how to control

229
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,280
the drone use camouflage technology and

230
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,500
send encrypted messages with the radio

231
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,150
it's really not an easy thing to learn

232
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,610
so what does that mean it means the ends

233
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,280
of mandatory recruitment

234
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,230
you see during World War two most

235
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,330
American males were required to fight on

236
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,010
the battlefront a couple of months of

237
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,690
training and well they're ready to go

238
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,580
then after the war all those soldiers

239
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,140
were sent back to their homes so they

240
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,180
could start their civil lives leaving

241
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,400
the ethical debate and the individual

242
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,920
freedom aside it is unthinkable to do

243
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,720
this nowadays America needs professional

244
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,670
armies so the soldiers can get the

245
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,650
training that they need no matter if

246
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,810
it's wartime or peacetime and now you

247
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,340
might be wondering Bob all of this

248
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,930
training all of this investment in human

249
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,450
capital doesn't really pay off well good

250
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,500
news we're going to answer that question

251
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
right now

252
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,590
[Music]

253
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,580
the world's largest art August the 2nd

254
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,980
1990 America starts a war against Saddam

255
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,990
Hussein's Iraq because they have invaded

256
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,420
Kuwait an important American ally this

257
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,790
is how the Gulf War started as you know

258
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,370
the u.s. of they won this war but again

259
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,589
the big surprise is how they want the

260
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,350
war for every 300 Iraqi casualties there

261
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,600
was one American casualty this is not

262
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,120
just a victory this is a military parade

263
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,640
a military parade that can be explained

264
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,720
by one thing only 10 years of

265
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,880
technological advantage so how does

266
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,440
American make sure that they have a

267
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,089
technological superiority

268
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,160
well let's thanks to what we call the

269
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,770
military-industrial complex this is the

270
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,240
partnership between the governments and

271
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,180
private companies

272
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,400
[Music]

273
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,620
so let me give you an example the f-35

274
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,440
project in the year 1992 the White House

275
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,330
launched a public tender to renovate

276
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,880
their combat jets many companies sent in

277
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,190
their bids and projects and finally the

278
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,440
winner was announced Lockheed Martin 28

279
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,480
years later the f-35 is finally being

280
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,610
mass manufactured this means that today

281
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,100
America has the world's best combat jet

282
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,589
Russia or China just can't match this

283
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,900
impressive technological feat but as we

284
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,910
said before each one of these planes

285
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,880
will set you back a hundred million

286
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,710
dollars so you might now be wondering

287
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,750
well this must be bad news for the

288
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,410
American Treasury right well it is and

289
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,440
it also isn't as we said 2018 saw the

290
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,870
first fully functioning f-35 jets on the

291
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,480
market on year later we've already got

292
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,960
news like this Norway join the f-35

293
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,480
program in November 2008 the Norwegian

294
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
government selected the f-35 as the

295
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,580
replacement for their f-16 fleet yes the

296
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,440
American military industry is also one

297
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,240
of America's biggest exports in other

298
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,010
words America spends six hundred fifty

299
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,620
billion dollars a year on defense most

300
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,270
of this money goes to paying civil

301
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,610
servant salaries for the maintenance of

302
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,220
facilities and buying weaponry but how

303
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,279
much does America export in weapons some

304
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,980
estimates say that in 2019 they would

305
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,810
have made more than four hundred billion

306
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,150
dollars and so what happens to the old

307
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,740
material what happens to the old

308
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,779
American combat jets well in some cases

309
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,060
they go to storage facilities but in

310
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,650
other cases they do things like this

311
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,750
4.8 billion dollar sale and upgrade of

312
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,930
Moroccan f16 aircraft approved by the US

313
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,460
I don't know what you're thinking come

314
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,200
on Simon you told us that America spends

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,520
a lot of money trying to have the

316
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,590
technological advantage and now they

317
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,450
sell their technology to other countries

318
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,220
isn't this just a way to lose that

319
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,830
advantage and the answer there is well

320
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,520
yes but also no you see the weapons

321
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,070
market is seldom a free market each time

322
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,830
the company sells Jets tanks or whatever

323
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,020
to another country they need Congress to

324
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,060
approve the transaction this means that

325
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,130
America sells only to their allies but

326
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,800
this is also a great political weapon

327
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,529
here is an example America America have

328
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:06,210
been big allies since the 18th century

329
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,240
why well that's a good story for another

330
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
video but for now let's just say that

331
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,779
America and Morocco are very good

332
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,720
friends in 1970s Morocco invaded Western

333
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,120
Sahara which was a Spanish colony as you

334
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,950
might imagine Spain wanted to defends

335
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,710
their colony with their tanks ins but

336
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,480
wait a minute did I just say their tanks

337
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,510
well those tanks had the made in America

338
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,339
label so well what do you think

339
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,680
Washington set probably something like

340
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,160
this looks plain I see you're gonna use

341
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,350
the tags that I made and gave to you to

342
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,600
fight my buddy Morocco don't do that and

343
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,640
it's not a suggestion if you do that

344
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,350
who's gonna repair your tanks cuz we're

345
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,120
not gonna he's gonna provide ammunition

346
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,920
for those tanks because we're not gonna

347
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,990
good luck Spain don't use those tanks

348
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,670
and if you thought this political

349
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,620
pressure was the thing of the past well

350
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,180
you better think again look what's going

351
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,450
on in Norway

352
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,050
Spa $0.35 sensitive Norwegian military

353
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,090
data back to Lockheed Martin in the

354
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,250
United States oh yes when we talk about

355
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,740
weaponry this issue all free market

356
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,840
globalization and stuff like that looks

357
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,730
pretty much like a bit of a joke

358
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,210
national interest is king but the story

359
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,860
doesn't stop here as you can imagine

360
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,750
American Congress is under huge pressure

361
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,089
to keep spending more and more money on

362
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,410
the military think about it we're

363
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,480
talking about more than 1.5 million

364
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,060
people making a living out of this for

365
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,529
example when we talk about the f-35

366
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,500
project it's not just a huge income for

367
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,960
Lockheed Martin it's also thousands of

368
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,000
jobs in the Lockheed Martin facilities

369
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,970
in Texas this means it's political

370
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,350
weapon to imagine that you're a

371
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,760
congressman from Texas and you're

372
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,800
running for elections the best thing you

373
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,839
can do is say to your voters something

374
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:53,390
like this guys the new f-35 is gonna be

375
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,880
built in Texas in a brand-new factory

376
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,710
that will employ a thousand

377
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,930
highly-skilled workers and pay a good

378
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,140
salary you're welcome by the way in

379
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,120
other words the military complex Lobby

380
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,490
is a big thing in America we're not just

381
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,680
talking about geopolitics but also about

382
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,589
jobs and votes this explains why the

383
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,750
Eisenhower farewell address is as

384
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,540
relevant today as it was back when it

385
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,370
was first set in the council's of

386
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,610
government we must guard against the

387
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,350
acquisition of unwarranted influence

388
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,260
whether sought or unsought by the

389
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,310
military-industrial complex the

390
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,960
potential for the disastrous rise of

391
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,500
misplaced power exists and will persist

392
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,930
so now a question for you do you think

393
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,820
America spends too much on its military

394
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,890
or do you think it's important to lead

395
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,740
the military technology race well let us
