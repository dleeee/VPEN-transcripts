folks his last days they were pretty

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,840
crazy something like a cross between

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,739
fantasy fiction and an ancient myth on

10
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:35,330

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,079

decrepit King Theoden from Lord of the

16
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:52,309
kind of Algerian version of El Cid

17
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,559
Campea Dora absolutely incapacitated

wheelchair and wheel him into his fifth

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,300
presidential term but follow the second

23
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:05,930

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,270
legendary Spanish historical character

[Music]

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,810

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,910
and it kicked off a chain of events both

35
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,310

36
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,530

45
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:11,500
but it's not an effective democracy what

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,360
they do have though is a lot of

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,590
questions on the table

48
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,270
what has vote leave comments for

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,700
Algeria's history what will happen when

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,770
he leaves and are we about to witness

51
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,290
new chapter of the Arab Spring well

52
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,240
today and visual politic we are going to

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,580
answer all of these questions but first

54
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,870
a bit of history

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,070
[Music]

56
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,730
the origin

57
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,110
we only need to take a look at our Giri

58
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,090
as most recent history to understands

59
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,459
the enormous power that the army has

60
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,830
always had in this country in the last

61
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,170
60 years Algeria has undergone a

62
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,120
liberation war against the French shake

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,160
military dictatorship that ran for more

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,970
than two decades and a 10-year civil war

65
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,769
in other words in the last 60 years the

66
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,500
Algerian army has been a key player in

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,290
most current affairs and most national

68
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,850
politics but basically if he hadn't

69
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,489
resigned April the 27th 2019 would have

70
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,410
marked the 20th anniversary since the

71
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,540
army candid overpower to boot fair car

72
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,190
in that time he was considered the

73
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,660
consensual president of Algeria two

74
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,069
decades later many people think that

75
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,260
this was Algeria's most stable period

76
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,180
and that over those decades it became

77
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,250
one of the safest countries in the Arab

78
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,930
world however many analysts think that

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,660
this is due to stagnation rather than

80
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,790
stability but hold on a second because

81
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,110
before we continue I think we should

82
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,000
answer a fundamental question

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
just who is abdul aziz boot flyer car

85
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,639
well depois our protagonist was born

86
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,400
eighty-two years ago in under a Moroccan

87
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,170
city near the border with Algeria

88
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,030
his parents were Algerians and at the

89
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,889
age of 19 he decided to join the

90
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,810
National Liberation Army to fight the

91
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,489
French during the war his career

92
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,319
skyrocketed and he soon became part of

93
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,689
Colonel who re booed midians in a circle

94
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,609
who was the main head of state that is

95
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,560
how once the country's independence was

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,780
achieved in 1962 mood Flair car was

97
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,729
already a minister even though he was

98
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:20,070
only 25 years old and shortly after that

99
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,289
when boumedienne himself then Minister

100
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,940
of Defense engineered a coup d'etat

101
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,530
taking a step towards the military

102
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,599
dictatorship our protagonist played a

103
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:34,020
very very important role you see who re

104
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,150
booed modeun was president of Algeria

105
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,669
until his death in 1978 and the dis side

106
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,770
was Butley a car who was Algeria's

107
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,750
foreign minister during the entire

108
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,639
dictatorship but of course after but--my

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,500
attends death Bouteflika suffered the

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,660
fate of many people who collaborate or

111
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,520
are a part of a dictatorship he fell

112
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,280
into disgrace he was accused of and

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,110
condemned of corruption and his public

114
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,690
image it was absolutely in tatters so he

115
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,780
moved to Europe

116
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,400
of course it didn't take long until he

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
returned to a very troubled algeria at

118
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,479
that time and we're talking about the

119
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,949
end of the 1980s in the beginning of the

120
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,259
1990s here the Algerian revolution it

121
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,819
was trying to leave behind a

122
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,770
single-party regime and become an

123
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,229
authentic democracy once and for all it

124
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,690
was precisely in this context in 1991

125
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,280
that the first open parliamentary

126
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,139
elections were held in the first rounds

127
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,909
the Islamist party won by a landslide

128
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,889
the second round it didn't even happen

129
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,810
the army annulled all votes before the

130
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,580
Islamists could achieve a sufficient

131
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,770
majority to change the constitution and

132
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,169
turn Algeria into a new Iran then

133
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,330
Algeria began a civil war against

134
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,120
Islamism the result 200,000 deaths

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,950

it was then after the Civil War that

141
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,650
Bouteflika is time it really came

142
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,680
see in 1999 the then military presidents

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,479
Lea means arrow I'll unexpectedly

144
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,280
resigned and called for presidential

145
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
elections so the army didn't want free

146
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,550
elections they saw a boat for the aircar

147
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,320
is the right person to lead Algeria

148
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,780
towards national reconciliation and as

149
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,610
it was said so it was done nothing else

150
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,290
was needed and were basically both

151
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,090
flicka's government managed to end the

152
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,770
civil war he managed to act with a

153
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,540
steady hands even at the worst of

154
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,580
moments and not only that both flare car

155
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,050
opens the country's economy to foreign

156
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,729
investments this made it possible for

157
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,770
gas and oil revenues to sustain the

158
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,570
government's social policies since then

159
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,699
folks Algeria has become a kind of Ron

160
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,350
ta country they took the income from

161
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,090
their oil and gas industry for granted

162
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,590
and defended heavily on that money to

163
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,940
run the country that large part of the

164
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,470
population quickly became accustomed to

165
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,330
subsidies and to the fact that basically

166
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,060
all products were heavily subsidized all

167
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,130
of this allowed motorcar to maintain as

168
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,630
popular support without having to take a

169
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,130
single step towards the country's

170
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,930
effective democratization

Annabeth

173
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,389
since mode flicka's rise to power that

174
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,400
power it was concentrated increasingly

175
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
in the presidential palace this became

176
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,389
so extreme that political institutions

177
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,789
cease to have any value in practice vote

178
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,610
flick ah he was the power the

179
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,740
concentration of power was so great that

180
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,270
when the leader suffered a stroke in

181
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,340
2013 nobody could see an alternative

182
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,219
there was no plan B all the plans for

183
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:24,620
our G Ria's future included Butley a car

184
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,629
as the country's political leader what

185
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,580
happens is that this stroke led to one

186
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,919
of the most surreal scenarios ever seen

187
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,139
in a country's politics but via car was

188
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,819
left in a wheelchair practically unable

189
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,770
to speak and completely dependent on

190
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,560
others obviously the president couldn't

191
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,539
govern under these conditions however

192
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,310
when presidential elections were held in

193
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,240
2014

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,159
nobody thought of an alternative even

195
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,389
though the president couldn't even

196
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:52,310
address the population during the entire

197
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,650
election campaign he still won the

198
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,779
elections now don't be surprised they

199
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,699
were Algerian democracy is a bit like

200
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,349
that the results are determined even

201
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,569
before the votes are cast and so now you

202
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:03,889
might be wondering why I mean if the old

203
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,360
leaders not doing it who exactly is

204
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,150
ruling Algeria and this is precisely

205
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,220
where lip of war comes in

206
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,770
see Papua is a French word that means

207
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,560
power so the power or the pouvoir as

208
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
they say in Algeria is an expression

209
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,890
that refers to the elites that have

210
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,900
dominated the Algerian Republic since

211
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,400
the country's independence these are

212
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,290
political economic and military elites

213
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,910
that have been unable to agree on a new

214
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,849
president for the last six years so yeah

215
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,219
you could probably see how Algerian

216
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,320
democracy really works in any case not

217
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,849
being able to agree on a candidate

218
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,620
wasn't something that really worried

219
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,300
these elites after all they had brutally

220
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,520
Akkar to maintain their privileges and

221
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,260
control over the country however this

222
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,160
time they made a mistake

223
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,670
[Music]

224
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,110
[Applause]

225
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:04,260
the limit since 2014 the drop in oil and

226
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,510
natural gas prices has been a major blow

227
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,370
to the Algerian economy the country's

228
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,500
income decreased by 50 percent and don't

229
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,820
forget that more than half of the

230
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,530
Algerian budget is financed by

231
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,750
hydrocarbon exports basically the books

232
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,450
became so wildly unbalanced that extreme

233
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,540
measures were taken such as this Algeria

234
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,090
bans imports of cellphones furniture

235
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,760
food to curb trade deficit and of course

236
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,650
in addition to these prohibitions many

237
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,450
other goods were taxed with very high

238
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,340
tariffs because of course when our NTA

239
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,130
country loses income well I mean how can

240
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,200
they pay the bills and reality is they

241
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
can't so those subsidies they have to

242
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,330
get cut Algerian lawmakers approved

243
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,550
budget calling for hikes in fuel prices

244
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,040
taxes

245
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,170
with the loss of income from the drop in

246
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,180
oil and gas prices Algeria's situation

247
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,100
it became critical you see despite the

248
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,540
government cutting spending by 10

249
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,130
percent per year the public deficit

250
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,740
reached an alarming level 12 percent of

251
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,300
the GDP and of course being unable to

252
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,920
finance many of the subsidies that the

253
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,360
government used to distribute the cost

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,670
of living in Algeria has skyrocketed in

255
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,200
the last five years and I think you

256
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,670
could probably now understand the huge

257
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,650
social discontent that's going on in

258
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,790
Algeria Algeria soaring food prices fuel

259
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,529
popular resentment

260
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,989
and as if this wasn't enough Algeria is

261
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,759
a very young population the average age

262
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,039
is under 30 the combination of a lot of

263
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,199
young people and economic stagnation can

264
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,539
be lethal for this type of regime why is

265
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,639
that because if a country is starker in

266
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,379
a crisis it can't create opportunities

267
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,089
for the young people and they have the

268
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:39,369
strength and vitality to take to the

269
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:42,159
streets and well that's precisely what

270
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,839
happens for young Algerians there was no

271
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,179
other way to end the regime led by the

272
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,919
mummy he has hopefully a car is

273
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,229
popularly known they aims to ends a

274
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,569
dictatorial and very corrupt regime that

275
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,309
has condemned the country to chronic

276
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:56,049
stagnation turning it into a country

277
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:58,179
that has had to get used to news like

278
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:02,139
this east-west highway 5 billion dollars

279
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:08,310
of corruption

280
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,630
that is why when on February the 10th

281
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,100
the regime announced Puglia cars

282
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,350
candidacy for a fifth turn in elections

283
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,060
that would of course be rigged it was

284
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,010
the straw that broke the camel's back

285
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,040
six days later on February the 16th 2019

286
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,170
mobilizations against this candidacy and

287
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,880
against the regime again little by

288
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
little the protests spread throughout

289
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,910
the country which organ about the

290
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,040
biggest mobilization that Algeria has

291
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,210
experienced since 1999

292
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:41,890
[Music]

293
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,380
and there's incredible success just six

294
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,640
weeks after the protests began

295
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,279
bouteflika was forced to resign and

296
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,160
leave power but of course this doesn't

297
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,529
mean that the problems are over for

298
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:54,190
Algeria

299
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,170
not at all we still need to see if the

300
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,910
elites will accept open elections

301
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,860
without pouting if the opposition can

302
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,420
get organized and prepare a solid

303
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,130
candidacy and if the results of this

304
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,110
process will actually lead to an

305
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,000
effective political transition meanwhile

306
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,649
the country's economy continues to have

307
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,300
many problems to balance the budget the

308
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,070
Margrave country needs to set the oil

309
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,560
price at over $99 Styron price on

310
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,310
asunder 75 and that's not all you see

311
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,870
one of the country's future challenges

312
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,029
is decreasing their dependence on

313
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,760
hydrocarbons but first Algeria needs to

314
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,410
liberalize its economy and favor the

315
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,180
arrival of more foreign investment in

316
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,010
the hydrocarbon sector in order to avoid

317
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,210
production forecasts from not being met

318
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:49,770
[Music]

319
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,720
folks algeria is one of the largest

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,580
energy producers in africa and it's a

321
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,410
key natural gas supplier to europe but

322
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,030
if there's no investments production

323
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,010
will fall and evidently a fall in

324
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,660
production due to not having invested

325
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,460
enough would seriously aggravate that

326
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,500
country's economic problems here at

327
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,880
visual politic we've already seen this

328
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,130
happen in Venezuela for example because

329
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,570
the investments that the oil sector

330
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,820
needed they were not made you want to

331
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,110
learn more about that we tell you all

332
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,540
about it in this video now algeria is

333
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,490
not venezuelan us obvious but

334
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,140
international companies complain about

335
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,760
the tremendous bureaucracy the

336
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,340
incredible uncertainty and also all the

337
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,170
corruption that plagues the country as

338
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,700
you can see the challenge that algeria

339
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,920
faces in the post vote fear car era is

340
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,930
enormous so what will happen to the

341
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,490
country from now on will the country

342
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,530
achieve its much-needed political and

343
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,390
economic transition or will the elites

344
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,870
of the

345
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,330
bouteflika era maintain their power and

346
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,950
control by putting another president

347
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,960
they trust in to lead the country well

348
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,300
that remains to be seen and we'll keep

349
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,070
you updated about it in any case in a

350
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,990
few years we hope that algeria will

351
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,150
resemble tunisia more than it does egypt

352
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,010
