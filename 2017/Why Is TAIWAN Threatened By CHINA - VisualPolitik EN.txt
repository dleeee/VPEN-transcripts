3
00:00:07.25 --> 00:00:11.370
many of you have asked for this video

4
00:00:09.57 --> 00:00:13.559
and to be honest we're not very

5
00:00:11.37 --> 00:00:15.179
surprised the Republic of China better

6
00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.830
known as Taiwan has some of the most

7
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.930
strange and controversial political and

8
00:00:16.83 --> 00:00:21.449
diplomatic situations in the entire

9
00:00:18.93 --> 00:00:23.220
world so let me explain at the time of

10
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.769
publishing this video Taiwan has only

11
00:00:23.22 --> 00:00:27.689
received formal recognition from 20 of

12
00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.699
the world's countries and some of these

13
00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.670
countries well they're pretty small like

14
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.829
the Vatican Tuvalu and Swaziland despite

15
00:00:35.67 --> 00:00:40.050
all of this Taiwan has managed to become

16
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.610
one of the richest and freest countries

17
00:00:40.05 --> 00:00:43.649
on the planet it has a well-equipped

18
00:00:41.61 --> 00:00:47.539
army and it is one of the spear heads

19
00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.829
over the United States in Southeast Asia

20
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.629
but before we really get into it let's

21
00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.949
take a look back and see where it all

22
00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.050
began the great Chinese separation the

23
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
situation Taiwan finds itself in has its

24
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:08.760
origin in the Chinese Civil War which

25
00:01:03.18 --> 00:01:10.560
took place between 1927 and 1949 it was

26
00:01:08.76 --> 00:01:12.299
a war between the conservative forces of

27
00:01:10.56 --> 00:01:14.189
the Chinese Nationalist Party led by

28
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.700
Chiang kai-shek and the forces of the

29
00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.219
Communist Party of Mao suit on

30
00:01:16.7 --> 00:01:21.439
on December the 10th 1949 the last

31
00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.479
sitting chengdu fell into the hands of

32
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.429
the nationalists the war had ended man

33
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.170
the Communists had gotten their way

34
00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.299
shortly before Chengdu fell our plane

35
00:01:27.17 --> 00:01:31.880
carrying the nationalist leader Chiang

36
00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.649
kai-shek left bound for Taiwan the last

37
00:01:31.88 --> 00:01:37.250
province on the nationalist controlled

38
00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.530
and he didn't go and learn with Chiang

39
00:01:37.25 --> 00:01:41.299
kai-shek two million more people took

40
00:01:39.53 --> 00:01:44.509
shelter in Taiwan along with the

41
00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.009
survivors the nationalist army since

42
00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.780
then and even though Mao Heights take

43
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.819
the islands back Taiwan has received

44
00:01:47.78 --> 00:01:51.709
support from the United States the u.s.

45
00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.119
continued recognizing the government of

46
00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.709
the island as the legitimate government

47
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.270
of China up until 1979 as a curious note

48
00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.829
here Taiwan is the only country other

49
00:01:59.27 --> 00:02:03.229
than the u.s. that has continually

50
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.560
operated the u-2 spy plane their mission

51
00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.479
was to monitor Mao's China the CIA

52
00:02:06.56 --> 00:02:12.920
itself was actually in charge of

53
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.930
conducting these operations now 1979

54
00:02:12.92 --> 00:02:16.819
it's a really important date at this

55
00:02:14.93 --> 00:02:19.010
time the United States was trying to

56
00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.569
build trust with Beijing this was in

57
00:02:19.01 --> 00:02:22.970
order to create some sort of a double

58
00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.530
envelopment against the Soviet Union we

59
00:02:22.97 --> 00:02:26.569
actually talked about this in a previous

60
00:02:24.53 --> 00:02:28.670
video and I'll leave a link to that in

61
00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.739
the description well the thing is in

62
00:02:28.67 --> 00:02:32.569
1979 the presidents of the United States

63
00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.150
Jimmy Carter decided to establish

64
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.590
diplomatic relations with Beijing and

65
00:02:35.15 --> 00:02:38.480
that meant that they had to stop

66
00:02:36.59 --> 00:02:40.280
recognizing the government of the

67
00:02:38.48 --> 00:02:41.989
Republic of China so that is the

68
00:02:40.28 --> 00:02:44.150
government based in Taipei

69
00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.709
you see Taiwan never declared its

70
00:02:44.15 --> 00:02:47.690
independence for years the government

71
00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.940
based in Taipei kept considering itself

72
00:02:47.69 --> 00:02:51.799
as the legitimate government of all of

73
00:02:49.94 --> 00:02:53.930
China as of course the country can only

74
00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.890
have diplomatic Lee speaking one

75
00:02:53.93 --> 00:02:59.200
government

76
00:02:55.89 --> 00:03:01.570
and yes this is how the one-china policy

77
00:02:59.2 --> 00:03:04.030
started and today this is supported by

78
00:03:01.57 --> 00:03:07.570
Washington and most countries around the

79
00:03:04.03 --> 00:03:09.370
world yeah this is a change by the way

80
00:03:07.57 --> 00:03:11.440
the course Taiwan to lose its place in

81
00:03:09.37 --> 00:03:15.940
the UN as well as other important

82
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:17.680
international organizations but it is

83
00:03:15.94 --> 00:03:20.140
true that the United States was still

84
00:03:17.68 --> 00:03:22.570
committed to the security of Taiwan that

85
00:03:20.14 --> 00:03:24.700
same yet in 1979 the American Congress

86
00:03:22.57 --> 00:03:26.290
passed the Taiwan Relations Act

87
00:03:24.7 --> 00:03:28.240
this was document that among other

88
00:03:26.29 --> 00:03:30.160
things reserved the option for the u.s.

89
00:03:28.24 --> 00:03:32.050
to ensure the security and defense of

90
00:03:30.16 --> 00:03:34.660
the island and since that act was passed

91
00:03:32.05 --> 00:03:44.579
the u.s. well it's done just that

92
00:03:34.66 --> 00:03:46.689
[Music]

93
00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.549
but as I was saying at the beginning of

94
00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.890
this video none of these things of cabs

95
00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.319
Taiwan for being the start of one of the

96
00:03:50.89 --> 00:04:00.250
greatest stories of economic and social

97
00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:02.739
success the big roar of the tiger in the

98
00:04:00.25 --> 00:04:04.840
1950s Taiwan it was a very poor place

99
00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.909
it's a pretty rudimentary economy where

100
00:04:04.84 --> 00:04:09.489
there exports were basically really

101
00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.829
basic things like rice and sugar so the

102
00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.450
question at that time was how are we

103
00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.040
going to develop such a poor island

104
00:04:13.45 --> 00:04:16.900
while the Taiwanese government thought

105
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:18.970
the best way to achieve success was to

106
00:04:16.9 --> 00:04:20.620
ensure that businesses on the island

107
00:04:18.97 --> 00:04:22.599
could sell their products all over the

108
00:04:20.62 --> 00:04:24.550
world this was considered to be as a

109
00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:29.110
best way to open up the island to the

110
00:04:24.55 --> 00:04:31.000
world and even encourage saving yeah it

111
00:04:29.11 --> 00:04:32.919
might seem counterintuitive but actually

112
00:04:31.0 --> 00:04:34.690
this action does encourage people to

113
00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.460
save because in order to invest you

114
00:04:34.69 --> 00:04:38.949
first need to get the resources that are

115
00:04:36.46 --> 00:04:40.539
necessary to do so and well that's

116
00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.070
exactly what they did the government of

117
00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.740
the island soon started to eliminate

118
00:04:42.07 --> 00:04:46.539
almost all import restrictions

119
00:04:44.74 --> 00:04:48.310
this meant the businesses could get all

120
00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.750
the products they required to set up

121
00:04:48.31 --> 00:04:52.120
their businesses and assembly line

122
00:04:49.75 --> 00:04:54.010
without being stunned by import fees

123
00:04:52.12 --> 00:04:56.789
this is sort of similar to what

124
00:04:54.01 --> 00:04:56.789
Singapore do

125
00:04:57.06 --> 00:05:01.840
besides this culture of saving added to

126
00:04:59.89 --> 00:05:04.300
the legal certainty over the country and

127
00:05:01.84 --> 00:05:05.680
encouraged further investments well soon

128
00:05:04.3 --> 00:05:07.630
enough Taiwanese companies began

129
00:05:05.68 --> 00:05:10.240
appearing like mushrooms after the rain

130
00:05:07.63 --> 00:05:14.110
as they exported all kinds of products

131
00:05:10.24 --> 00:05:15.970
the rest of the world 1980 industrial

132
00:05:14.11 --> 00:05:17.320
products were already 90 percent of the

133
00:05:15.97 --> 00:05:20.120
country's exports and they were growing

134
00:05:17.32 --> 00:05:22.610
an average of 30 percent per year

135
00:05:20.12 --> 00:05:24.470
I want the viewer they sold all kinds of

136
00:05:22.61 --> 00:05:26.810
things to the world toys radios like

137
00:05:24.47 --> 00:05:28.760
socks just about everything and of

138
00:05:26.81 --> 00:05:30.680
course as you can imagine with that sort

139
00:05:28.76 --> 00:05:33.889
of situation the per capita income

140
00:05:30.68 --> 00:05:41.479
didn't stop growing in just 30 years it

141
00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:44.600
multiplied by five hands with that a new

142
00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.189
Asian tiger was born

143
00:05:44.6 --> 00:05:47.839
[Music]

144
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.909
now don't for a minute think that this

145
00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.309
was an easy process I mean Taiwan didn't

146
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.020
even have democracy until the 1990s but

147
00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:56.239
once they've got their freedom the

148
00:05:54.02 --> 00:06:00.069
Taiwanese people they held onto it

149
00:05:56.239 --> 00:06:00.069
tightly let's look at an example

150
00:06:01.3 --> 00:06:06.439
Taiwan is today considered the 11th

151
00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.019
freest economy in the world in Asia only

152
00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.879
Hong Kong in Singapore ranked better

153
00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:12.499
it's a rich country with quite a high

154
00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.389
standard of living and it is one of the

155
00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:17.360
countries that has a significant number

156
00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.209
of civil liberties and in fact Taiwan

157
00:06:17.36 --> 00:06:22.069
they're about to make history

158
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:24.469
Taiwan Court rules in favor of same-sex

159
00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.009
marriage in historic first for an Asian

160
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.009
country

161
00:06:30.73 --> 00:06:34.480
so as you can see compared with

162
00:06:32.53 --> 00:06:36.910
continental China selves their

163
00:06:34.48 --> 00:06:38.890
brilliance no comparison in terms of per

164
00:06:36.91 --> 00:06:40.810
capita income the Taiwanese are today

165
00:06:38.89 --> 00:06:43.720
three times richer than the Chinese and

166
00:06:40.81 --> 00:06:45.370
they are much more free but alright in

167
00:06:43.72 --> 00:06:48.760
spite of all of this good stuff there

168
00:06:45.37 --> 00:06:51.210
are still some clouds on the horizon

169
00:06:48.76 --> 00:06:55.990
[Music]

170
00:06:51.21 --> 00:06:57.550
clouds in the Taiwanese sky the truth is

171
00:06:55.99 --> 00:06:59.110
that in the last few years the country

172
00:06:57.55 --> 00:07:01.720
has been going through a few things

173
00:06:59.11 --> 00:07:04.150
salaries have been frozen for years and

174
00:07:01.72 --> 00:07:06.070
in 2015 the country went through a small

175
00:07:04.15 --> 00:07:08.440
recession since then economic growth

176
00:07:06.07 --> 00:07:10.720
well it's been very slow and now the

177
00:07:08.44 --> 00:07:13.300
rather obvious question is what exactly

178
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:15.520
is happening well there are several

179
00:07:13.3 --> 00:07:17.560
ingredients to this rather bitter recipe

180
00:07:15.52 --> 00:07:22.450
which is threatening the future of the

181
00:07:17.56 --> 00:07:23.710
island some of this is competition from

182
00:07:22.45 --> 00:07:26.440
new emerging markets like China

183
00:07:23.71 --> 00:07:28.120
Indonesia Vietnam PES also the brain

184
00:07:26.44 --> 00:07:30.430
drain and the aging population and the

185
00:07:28.12 --> 00:07:32.110
close to broken pension system the

186
00:07:30.43 --> 00:07:34.720
latter of these that pension system is

187
00:07:32.11 --> 00:07:36.850
the problem that by far concerns the

188
00:07:34.72 --> 00:07:38.380
government of the most look for years

189
00:07:36.85 --> 00:07:40.510
the pensions of public workers they were

190
00:07:38.38 --> 00:07:42.880
inflated for political reasons they did

191
00:07:40.51 --> 00:07:45.850
this in order to get votes and well it

192
00:07:42.88 --> 00:07:48.310
became really really expensive public

193
00:07:45.85 --> 00:07:50.200
pensions were so inflated that they are

194
00:07:48.31 --> 00:07:51.750
now threatening the stability of the

195
00:07:50.2 --> 00:07:54.910
entire system

196
00:07:51.75 --> 00:07:56.950
Taiwanese workers earn about 1,300 US

197
00:07:54.91 --> 00:07:58.840
dollars per month on average but retired

198
00:07:56.95 --> 00:08:02.320
high school teachers receive a whopping

199
00:07:58.84 --> 00:08:06.160
average pension of 2250 u.s. dollars per

200
00:08:02.32 --> 00:08:08.830
month and as you well know bad policies

201
00:08:06.16 --> 00:08:10.900
turn out to be expensive but let's

202
00:08:08.83 --> 00:08:12.280
consider some of the other problems to

203
00:08:10.9 --> 00:08:14.470
continue our metaphor the next

204
00:08:12.28 --> 00:08:17.770
ingredient in our bitter recipes would

205
00:08:14.47 --> 00:08:20.140
be what is called the 40/40 issue so the

206
00:08:17.77 --> 00:08:22.270
Taiwanese economy it's very dependent on

207
00:08:20.14 --> 00:08:25.380
the electronic industry as well as

208
00:08:22.27 --> 00:08:25.380
commerce in China

209
00:08:26.31 --> 00:08:32.919
electronic goods are 40% of all of their

210
00:08:28.87 --> 00:08:37.620
exports in China is the destination of

211
00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:37.620
almost 40 percent of Taiwan's exports

212
00:08:37.74 --> 00:08:42.640
and now you might be wondering well what

213
00:08:41.2 --> 00:08:44.440
exactly is the problem with that

214
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:46.060
well this dependence on electronics and

215
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:48.010
China means that when the electronics

216
00:08:46.06 --> 00:08:51.670
industry or China isn't doing well

217
00:08:48.01 --> 00:08:53.260
economically Taiwan suffers too and well

218
00:08:51.67 --> 00:08:55.330
that's precisely what has happened over

219
00:08:53.26 --> 00:08:56.440
the last few years but wait because

220
00:08:55.33 --> 00:08:58.540
we're not done yet

221
00:08:56.44 --> 00:09:00.490
above all there is a political problem

222
00:08:58.54 --> 00:09:02.350
which has affected the country severely

223
00:09:00.49 --> 00:09:04.450
and has caused foreign investment in

224
00:09:02.35 --> 00:09:07.360
Taiwan to be significantly lower than

225
00:09:04.45 --> 00:09:09.070
that of the countries nearby and so well

226
00:09:07.36 --> 00:09:14.950
what's the problem there well foreign

227
00:09:09.07 --> 00:09:19.330
investors they're afraid of China the

228
00:09:14.95 --> 00:09:21.640
Chinese threat this is by far the

229
00:09:19.33 --> 00:09:24.220
biggest problem that Taiwan is facing

230
00:09:21.64 --> 00:09:26.350
the governments of Beijing is determined

231
00:09:24.22 --> 00:09:28.120
to regain sovereignty over the island

232
00:09:26.35 --> 00:09:30.370
and it's made a public declaration on

233
00:09:28.12 --> 00:09:32.589
the matter that states two things first

234
00:09:30.37 --> 00:09:34.209
of all it will happen before 2049 the

235
00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:36.220
100th anniversary of the People's

236
00:09:34.209 --> 00:09:38.800
Republic of China and second that they

237
00:09:36.22 --> 00:09:41.200
are willing to use force if Taiwan tries

238
00:09:38.8 --> 00:09:42.410
to declare its independence so let me

239
00:09:41.2 --> 00:09:44.279
dig into that a little further

240
00:09:42.41 --> 00:09:46.690
[Music]

241
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:48.100
Taiwan could be considered an

242
00:09:46.69 --> 00:09:50.110
independent country from pretty much

243
00:09:48.1 --> 00:09:52.240
every perspective the island has its own

244
00:09:50.11 --> 00:09:54.310
presidents whose democratically elected

245
00:09:52.24 --> 00:09:55.180
by the way it has its own laws it has

246
00:09:54.31 --> 00:09:57.940
its own army

247
00:09:55.18 --> 00:10:00.339
however Beijing isn't going to accept

248
00:09:57.94 --> 00:10:02.380
formal independence the most de are

249
00:10:00.339 --> 00:10:05.050
willing to give Taiwan temporarily is a

250
00:10:02.38 --> 00:10:07.510
status similar to that of Hong Kong and

251
00:10:05.05 --> 00:10:09.640
this is pretty serious because among

252
00:10:07.51 --> 00:10:12.250
other things most Taiwanese don't feel

253
00:10:09.64 --> 00:10:13.010
that their identity is tied to China

254
00:10:12.25 --> 00:10:14.520
[Music]

255
00:10:13.01 --> 00:10:17.050
[Applause]

256
00:10:14.52 --> 00:10:18.850
they'd still like citizens of a free

257
00:10:17.05 --> 00:10:20.320
country which has been independent for

258
00:10:18.85 --> 00:10:22.750
almost 70 years

259
00:10:20.32 --> 00:10:24.400
in fact in 2014 when the previous

260
00:10:22.75 --> 00:10:26.500
government of Taiwan tried to approach

261
00:10:24.4 --> 00:10:29.080
Beijing to develop a trade agreement the

262
00:10:26.5 --> 00:10:30.760
Taiwanese people started a revolution

263
00:10:29.08 --> 00:10:32.920
which eventually became known as the

264
00:10:30.76 --> 00:10:35.170
sunflower revolution hundreds of young

265
00:10:32.92 --> 00:10:37.560
people protested with the motto Taiwan

266
00:10:35.17 --> 00:10:40.680
is not for sale

267
00:10:37.56 --> 00:10:44.200
[Music]

268
00:10:40.68 --> 00:10:46.390
it was exactly under this atmosphere of

269
00:10:44.2 --> 00:10:49.630
economic and political frustration but

270
00:10:46.39 --> 00:10:51.760
in 2016 the Democratic Progressive Party

271
00:10:49.63 --> 00:10:53.230
a party whose foundations were mainly

272
00:10:51.76 --> 00:10:56.910
pro-independence one that the

273
00:10:53.23 --> 00:10:59.530
legislative and presidential elections

274
00:10:56.91 --> 00:11:01.120
sighing wang of the closest politician

275
00:10:59.53 --> 00:11:05.140
to Beijing it became the first female

276
00:11:01.12 --> 00:11:07.000
president of Taiwan and even though the

277
00:11:05.14 --> 00:11:09.220
economy was the most crucial factor

278
00:11:07.0 --> 00:11:11.260
Beijing didn't like this election at all

279
00:11:09.22 --> 00:11:13.830
they disapproved of it so much that they

280
00:11:11.26 --> 00:11:17.200
decided to start harassing Taiwan again

281
00:11:13.83 --> 00:11:19.260
in 2017 and up to now Chinese tourism to

282
00:11:17.2 --> 00:11:21.490
Taiwan has been reduced by 40 percent

283
00:11:19.26 --> 00:11:23.920
Beijing has convinced two countries

284
00:11:21.49 --> 00:11:25.630
Panama and South tomé and príncipe to

285
00:11:23.92 --> 00:11:27.460
stop recognizing Taiwan and it is

286
00:11:25.63 --> 00:11:30.310
blocking the presence of the island in

287
00:11:27.46 --> 00:11:32.530
many international forums so now there

288
00:11:30.31 --> 00:11:34.630
has been no economic retaliation but the

289
00:11:32.53 --> 00:11:36.790
island knows that they could be in for a

290
00:11:34.63 --> 00:11:38.470
severe blow this is why one of the

291
00:11:36.79 --> 00:11:40.270
priorities of the new government is to

292
00:11:38.47 --> 00:11:42.220
open up to as many new markets as

293
00:11:40.27 --> 00:11:43.780
possible as soon as possible

294
00:11:42.22 --> 00:11:45.490
so now you might be wondering where is

295
00:11:43.78 --> 00:11:47.500
the u.s. in all of this I mean this is a

296
00:11:45.49 --> 00:11:49.330
visual politic video after all and we've

297
00:11:47.5 --> 00:11:51.490
been a little light on the u.s. so far

298
00:11:49.33 --> 00:11:53.950
so where are they well for now their

299
00:11:51.49 --> 00:11:55.150
support seems to remain intact in fact

300
00:11:53.95 --> 00:11:57.190
Trump's administration has already

301
00:11:55.15 --> 00:12:00.360
approved a weapon sale to Taiwan that

302
00:11:57.19 --> 00:12:03.040
one of the 1.5 billion dollars

303
00:12:00.36 --> 00:12:05.470
administration approves first arms sale

304
00:12:03.04 --> 00:12:06.970
to Taiwan and on top of all that the

305
00:12:05.47 --> 00:12:09.250
powerful Senate Armed Services Committee

306
00:12:06.97 --> 00:12:11.290
in the United States allows Navy ships

307
00:12:09.25 --> 00:12:13.210
to use Taiwanese ports and they did so

308
00:12:11.29 --> 00:12:15.580
with a majority of votes from both the

309
00:12:13.21 --> 00:12:17.410
Democratic and the Republican parties if

310
00:12:15.58 --> 00:12:19.870
both chambers finally approved that

311
00:12:17.41 --> 00:12:21.790
decision you can bet that Beijing

312
00:12:19.87 --> 00:12:23.740
going to be pretty annoyed but what is

313
00:12:21.79 --> 00:12:25.960
Washington's objective here well that

314
00:12:23.74 --> 00:12:28.240
would be to try and prevent Beijing from

315
00:12:25.96 --> 00:12:30.670
even thinking about a military invasion

316
00:12:28.24 --> 00:12:32.260
of Taiwan and that's pretty much it for

317
00:12:30.67 --> 00:12:33.940
now here a visual politic we're going to

318
00:12:32.26 --> 00:12:35.950
keep a close eye on Taiwan as the

319
00:12:33.94 --> 00:12:37.660
situation develops but now it's your

320
00:12:35.95 --> 00:12:39.730
turn what do you think the future of

321
00:12:37.66 --> 00:12:41.470
Taiwan will hold well you can leave us

322

323
