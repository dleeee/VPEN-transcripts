[Music]

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,559
the Netherlands is one of the lowest

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,990
lying countries in the world and believe

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,330
me when I say that these are really

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,860
really low loans

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,610
[Music]

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,560
[Applause]

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,020
the average elevation is only 30 meters

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,670
and a quarter of Dutch territory is

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,230
below sea level this also makes the

14
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,580
Netherlands one of the country's most

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,980
under threats from possible rising sea

16
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,900
levels caused by global warming

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,460
but it's not the most threatened country

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,380
as many of you will know the Maldives is

19
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,600
most at risk with an average altitude of

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
just two meters this is incredible

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,650
especially if we consider that despite

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,270
being a flat island in the middle of the

23
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,400
ocean its capital male is one of the

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,290
most densely populated cities on the

25
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,910
entire planet having said that we're

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,199
gonna leave the Maldives for another

27
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:03,970
occasion because in this video we're

28
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,650
going to focus on the Netherlands and

29
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,480
some of the most ominous predictions

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:15,159
that are currently faces you may have

31
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,600
seen images like the one appearing on

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,530
your screen right now

33
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,530
images models and maps showing how most

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,270
of the territory of the Netherlands

35
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,190
including its capital Amsterdam will

36
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,409
disappear under the sea as a result of

37
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,240
melting polar ice caps logically it

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,530
would follow that such an event would

39
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,570
eventually force the Dutch to emigrate

40
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,490
on mass to neighboring countries like

41
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,530
Germany because according to scientific

42
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,850
estimates the sea level could rise

43
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,560
between thirty to seventy seven

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,939
centimetres by the year 2100 the worst

45
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,369
case scenarios predict a rise of 200

46
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,359
centimeters and even though that may not

47
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,640
sound like much those centimetres they

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,009
really do count not only because a rise

49
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,020
in the sea level would flood many lands

50
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,880
as low-lying as the Netherlands but also

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,619
because as it would multiply it the

52
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,840
flood damage for example causing floods

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,000
and river overflows when storms occur

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,649
this of course would translate into a

55
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,600
loss of human lives destroyed crops and

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,080
cities flooded lands etc

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,319
[Music]

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,480
however just a second because in this

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,189
video we're going to show you how the

60
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:21,810
inhabitants of the Netherlands are

61
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,879
already working to face this gigantic

62
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,950
challenge dealing with the rising sea

63
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,840
level it's a problem for which they only

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,700
really have two options the first is to

65
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,379
find the water building a higher levees

66
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,450
larger or more resistant dams and more

67
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,569
powerful containment infrastructure the

68
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,250
second option is to embrace their

69
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,409
neighbour water and try to control and

70
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:44,730
live with it as we should no we're

71
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,139
talking about a country with a lot of

72
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,500
experience in the matter people living

73
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,000
on the lands that we currently know as

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
the Netherlands have been suffering the

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,510
effects of huge floods that periodically

76
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,669
ended the lives of dozens to tens of

77
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,709
thousands of people for centuries even

78
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,620
before the Middle Ages take the flood

79
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,329
that occurred in 1287 that took the

80
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:05,099
lives of between fifty to eighty

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,900
thousand people and you know what even

82
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,579
back then they already had containment

83
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:10,230
dams a hydraulic achievement that was

84
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,760
quite advanced for the time we talked

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,900
this was more than 700 years ago so as

86
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,370
you can see this is a population that is

87
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,349
very used to living with and fighting

88
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,120
against water and now the big questions

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,010
that crop up are how on earth are the

90
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,479
Dutch preparing for the future are they

91
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,340
fighting a losing battle can the

92
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,440
Netherlands even survive global warming

93
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,329
if the poles partially melt and raise

94
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:30,990
the sea level

95
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,560
[Music]

96
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,670
natural risk or human risk so it's no

97
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,769
surprise obviously rising sea levels are

98
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,810
a great risk for the Netherlands and for

99
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,040
much of the world and it's true that if

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,389
there's one thing that characterizes

101
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,569
human beings it's our ability to adapt

102
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,730
face adversity and overcome virtually

103
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,709
any risk than nature throws at us right

104
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,900
now that threat really is on the table

105
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,549
so what exactly is the risk we're

106
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,560
talking about right now is the sea the

107
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,320
risk or are we the humans the real risk

108
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,859
[Music]

109
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,359
this map shows the areas that the

110
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,189
Netherlands has reclaimed from the sea

111
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,590
since the 14th century as you can see

112
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,599
that Dutch have been swallowing areas of

113
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,310
the sea for centuries building cities

114
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,680
and planting crops in areas with a high

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,330
risk of flooding areas that were once

116
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,310
underwater Arryn's could well be again

117
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,780
one day after all the sea has been

118
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,180
redrawing the map for millions and

119
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,979
millions of years the waters have

120
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,960
advanced and receded in till we got more

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,030
or less the map that we know today which

122
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,340
was completed about 6,000 years ago in

123
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,289
geological time 6,000 years was

124
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,760
practically the day before yesterday

125
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,190
however now the problem emerges because

126
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,539
the pace of natural warming has

127
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,750
accelerated due to human activity in

128
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,909
order to understand the worldwide

129
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,800
situation and specifically that of the

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,810
Netherlands better we can say that we're

131
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,909
facing two major challenges and the

132
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,919
truth is that both are fundamentally

133
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,960
man-made the first challenge is to slow

134
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,849
global warming to levels as close as

135
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,680
possible to natural warming and the

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,570
second is to avoid occupying high-risk

137
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,580
spaces such as polders which are lands

138
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,139
that have been reclaimed from the sea or

139
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,389
flood plains near rivers which are areas

140
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,979
susceptible to natural floods so let me

141
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,659
ask you a question if I build my house

142
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,610
in flood zone next to a river and one

143
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,590
day a flood comes and destroys my house

144
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,659
is it my fault or is it the fault of the

145
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,259
river and the flood

146
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:36,490
perhaps from a general point of view

147
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,199
many of us would blame the river but in

148
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,610
the Netherlands they have a deep-rooted

149
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,039
culture of coexistence with water to

150
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,990
some extent they know that they are the

151
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,179
guests then is they occupy a place that

152
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,639
the sea used to occupy and in which they

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,539
need to continue coexisting and that's

154
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,039
what makes the Dutch a bit different do

155
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:55,539
you want some concrete examples well

156
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:56,740
let's take a look

157
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,460
[Music]

158
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,950
the battle against the sea strategy

159
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,530
change

160
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,840
if the inhabitants of these lowlands

161
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,430
have learned anything over the years

162
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,140
it's that fighting against the sea is a

163
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,850
losing battle a certain failure sunny

164
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,500
explained the strategy of protecting

165
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,330
themselves through dikes dune barriers

166
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,520
dams and reservoirs to control rising

167
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,200
sea levels has been used for centuries

168
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
the greatest example of this public

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,710
strategy of protection against the sea

170
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,780
was the Delta Works project developed

171
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,940
after the great flood of 1953 that

172
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,980
killed almost 2,000 people in the single

173
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,400
night the project was completed in 1997

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,930
with the construction of a gigantic

175
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,180
barrier near Rotterdam with twin gates

176
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,130
as large as two Eiffel Towers that

177
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,290
rotate on tracks to seal the waterway

178
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,180
they take two hours to close over the

179
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,040
past two decades the barrier gates have

180
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,990
not yet been use to contain any massive

181
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,370
flooding but the Netherlands pushed the

182
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,870
Delta plan forward with the aim of

183
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,820
creating effective protection for at

184
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,230
least 200 years but hold on a minute

185
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,000
because we're overlooking something the

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,980
Delta plan is a project from the last

187
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,630
century and the truth is that over the

188
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,640
last decades knowledge about rising sea

189
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,710
levels and their effects has increased

190
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,240
that's exactly why the Netherlands has

191
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,130
now changed its perspective you see

192
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,570
after Delta watch the Dutch have

193
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,310
switched from planning for more and

194
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,200
higher levies to planning for controlled

195
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,760
floods in fact very recently in March

196
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,310
2019 they finished construction on the

197
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,080
room for the river project a huge

198
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,850
project with a budget of about three

199
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,140
billion dollars this is a project that

200
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,370
is sought to expand the river

201
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,680
floodplains whereas a high overflow risk

202
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,690
basically it involves diverting flood

203
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,880
waters to control areas and it sounds

204
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,750
pretty sensible

205
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,830
[Music]

206
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,990
one of the best examples we can find of

207
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,270
this is in drag spaulder a fundamentally

208
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,979
agricultural polder in which they've

209
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:59,289
created a large aquatic recreation area

210
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:01,270
however as you can imagine leisure isn't

211
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,129
the main objective of this huge body of

212
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,500
water and canals rather it's designed to

213
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,870
absorb and contain water during floods

214
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,370
and large storms it is close to

215
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,379
Rotterdam and it's also the lowest point

216
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,389
in Netherlands so it's one of the area's

217
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,250
most likely to flood in the entire

218
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,729
country

219
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,530
this kind of reservoir is designed to

220
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,060
prevent spread of water during the

221
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,710
overflows of the Rhine River which is

222
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,599
expected to happen periodically once

223
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,740
every 10 years but don't think that's

224
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,940
the end of it because apart from the

225
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,169
noob holders that are capable of

226
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,969
absorbing floods the Dutch government's

227
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,159
policies and those of its cities go much

228
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:37,260
further

229
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,300
Dutch engineers have been preparing the

230
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,160
country for decades keeping a worst-case

231
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,930
scenario in minds and always thinking

232
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,180
long-term we're talking 100 200 or even

233
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,010
a thousand years and that's a great way

234
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,240
to prepare in Rotterdam one of the

235
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,650
cities with the highest risk of flooding

236
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,360
they are creating a large number of

237
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,610
public spaces to evacuate water and thus

238
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,700
help prevent a lot of damage for example

239
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,110
there's the creation of water squares

240
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,210
such as the Bentham plane an area that

241
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,040
in case of floods or storms turns the

242
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,900
lower areas of the enclosure which

243
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,460
usually holds leisure and sports

244
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,200
facilities in such gigantic swimming

245
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,540
pools that can hold up to 1.7 million

246
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,130
litres of water all of that water

247
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,720
instead of causing a great deal of

248
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,820
damage can drain gradually to avoid mass

249
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,450
flooding but there's still more even

250
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,400
garages are being designed as water

251
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,020
tanks in case of an emergency the

252
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,790
fundamental idea in Rotterdam and other

253
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,500
vulnerable cities is to create as many

254
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,510
controlled water tanks as possible to

255
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,520
safeguard homes and major infrastructure

256
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,530
that is do allow flooding but to control

257
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,120
it and all of this will greatly reduce

258
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,830
economic costs after a natural disaster

259
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,620
or a major weather event

260
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,600
and the best part is that both citizens

261
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,250
and politicians share this vision I

262
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,540
can't just keep building higher levees

263
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,890
because we'll end up living behind

264
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,990
10-meter walls we need to give the

265
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,210
rivers more places to flow protection

266
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,770
against climate change is only as strong

267
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,080
as the weakest link in the chain and the

268
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,060
chain in our case includes not just the

269
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,160
big gates and dams the sea but a whole

270
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,500

274

still not done and what may be somewhat

275
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,460
more controversial the government is

276
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,650
expropriating agricultural lands from

277
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,510
farmers to create controlled flood zones

278
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,520
they're doing this without asking for or

279
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,290
searching for volunteers farmers just

280
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,600
have to leave safety above all at least

281
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,930
that's what they say

282
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,670
however many of these farmers are

283
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,320
seeking an opportunity to change to

284
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,390
create something new and to adapt to a

285
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,130
future with more water in the

286
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,480
Netherlands and it's also true the

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,310
compensation money has also led some

288
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,410
farmers to retire but there are much

289
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,750
other more curious reinvention examples

290
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,460
such as the invention of floating farms

291
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,750
with financial support from the city of

292
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,610
Rotterdam the balidaan company has

293
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,650
created the first floating dairy farm at

294
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,570
the moment sits only a 2 million euro

295
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,370
prototype 40 cows that could produce

296
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,500
half a million litres of milk per year

297
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,850
and perhaps if the costs were lower

298
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,710
inventions such as this would allow the

299
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,270
Netherlands to alleviate some of the

300
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,680
problems that the elimination of

301
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,240
agricultural lands for the benefit of

302
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,310
waterways can pose for its economy they

303
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,720
are after all the world's second largest

304
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,210
exporter of agricultural products second

305
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,890
only to the United States with more than

306
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,780
90 billion euros in exports in 2018 as

307
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,130
you may have gathered from this video a

308
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,300
dutch won't give up easily

309
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,070
they have always lived side by side with

310
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,750
water and it seems that they'll continue

311
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,000
to do so and many generations that's why

312
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,770
they've been adapting for the worst-case

313
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,990
scenarios for decades a sea-level rise

314
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,660
of up to 77 centimetres or even more by

315
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,290
2100

316
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,730
nor should we be surprised by the huge

317
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,649
capacity for adaption that human beings

318
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,779
have shown when faced with all kinds of

319
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,430
scenarios the point is that it doesn't

320
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,019
look like the Netherlands will disappear

321
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,820
underwater at least not in the coming

322
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,889
decades the apocalyptic scenario they'll

323
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,690
only occur if the Dutch stands still for

324
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,089
decades or centuries without acting and

325
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:59,009
today here we've shown that that's

326
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,199
simply not the case obviously that

327
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,550
doesn't mean that global warming isn't

328
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,410
challenged indeed as a challenge that we

329
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,959
all have to address and overcome however

330
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,000
what we have wanted to show in this

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,430
video is how some societies have already

332
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,290
begun to prepare for tomorrow's world

333
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,329
and out perhaps looking for solutions is

334
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,040
better than getting carried away with

335
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,750
sensationalism and now it's your turn

336
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,459
the Netherlands will be with us for a

337
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,410
while that case as soon as clear but do

338
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,639
you think the time will come when not

339
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,440
even the most advanced technologies will

340
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,029
allow the Dutch to live in their country

341
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:31,709
and in your country's case how do you

342
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,269
think the government and society would

343
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,190
respond to such a challenge well leave

344
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,810
