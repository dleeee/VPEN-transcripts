3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:09,900
Lebanon is the smallest country in all

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,820
of Asia and one of the smallest in the

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,009
Islamic world nevertheless Lebanon is

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,800
also the country where 70% of all Arabic

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,980
books are published

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,680

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,500
for decades Beirut was just short being

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,140
the Arabic New York City Lebanon was

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,210
often labeled the Switzerland of the

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,279
Middle East but today things have

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,890
changed and they have changed for the

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,629
worse we don't win about a country with

15
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:38,550
a smaller population than New York City

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,650
a country where a good percentage of

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,870
Sunni Muslims Shia Muslims and

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,870
Christians all live a country located in

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,850
one of the most troubled regions of the

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,559
planet as you can imagine these are the

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,260
perfect ingredients for a problematic

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,910
country so you might not be wondering

23
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,070
well why are we talking about Lebanon

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,869
anyway well in order to answer that

25
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:59,790
question we need to travel to another

26
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,860
country that we know much better here on

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,920
visual politic and yes of course we're

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,650
talking about Saudi Arabia

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,560
[Music]

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,049
as you know Saudi Arabia is an oil-rich

31
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,690
monarchy where human rights are let's

32
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,080
just say they're human wrongs

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,540
nevertheless things are changing in this

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,780
country a lot for example they've gotten

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,759
rid of a law that forbade women from

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,530
driving and if that doesn't sound

37
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,670
progressive enough for you

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,649
Saudi Arabia is the first country in the

39
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:34,590
world to give citizenship to a robot yes

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,440
that is right Sofia is the first robot

41
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,310
to get legal citizenship in a country

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,229
[Music]

43
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,000
yes I know this sounds as funny as it

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,909
does irrelevant human rights wise but

45
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,550
you know there you go but this isn't all

46
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,020
there all Saudi house plans to spend

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,330
five hundred billion dollars building a

48
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,149
city run entirely on green energy again

49
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,220
this has nothing to do with democracy or

50
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,429
human rights but it sure is great PR so

51
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,759
to do all of this political progress

52
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,709
well you could probably guess our

53
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,680
protagonist today is this man prince bin

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,150
Salman the crown prince of Saudi Arabia

55
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,190
since the Year 2015 he's been considered

56
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,380
the ultimate Rainmaker in Saudi Arabia

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,750
the man in charge of trying to turn an

58
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,150
oil dependent nation into one with a

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,160
diversified economy we've talked about

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,780
this many times on visual politic and

61
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,790
it's called vision 2030 and it's been

62
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,710
Solomon's plan to bring Saudi Arabia

63
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,630
into the 21st century

64
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,480
at least when it comes to economics all

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,100
of a sudden this country wants to have

66
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,290
its own sovereign wealth fund following

67
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,720
the Norwegian model today Saudi cash is

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,430
flowing into tech companies like uber

69
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,990
and slack and lyft

70
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,610
but hold on just a second because not

71
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,160
everything is sunshine and rainbows as

72
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,990
you can imagine so much modernization is

73
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,760
raising criticism among the Saudi

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,370
political elites and this is where the

75
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,620
modern and progressive bin Salman shows

76
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,390
his real face

77
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,540
[Music]

78
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,980
it's a political playbook that combines

79
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,030
an iron fist luxury and creativity for

80
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,379
example how do you think he's fighting a

81
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,659
rampant corruption in his country well

82
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,970
in November of 2017 mr. bin Salman

83
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,069
invited more than 30 Saudi officials and

84
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,440
businessman to spend a few days at the

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,379
ritz-carlton hotel in Riyadh it's a very

86
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,750
luxurious place and I mean most of us

87
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,400
would probably like to spend a few days

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,349
there the thing is once they all arrives

89
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,659
well what you think happens well once

90
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:39,920
they got there been somebody locked the

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,930
doors basically said you guys are under

92
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,140
arrest this hotel is your Jail have fun

93
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,400
so I probably could guess what you're

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,810
thinking right now you'd be quite okay

95
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,010
if you were just locked up in a

96
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,859
five-star hotel for a jail for a little

97
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:54,140
while but you know the idea of jailing

98
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,290
someone without a trial isn't really a

99
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,900
good thing and this is what bin Salman

100
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,599
he did to his close friends so maybe you

101
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,400
can imagine what he might do to those

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,870
who are not so close to him

103
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,700
officials fear prime minister of Lebanon

104
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,850
Saud al-hariri has been kidnapped by

105
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,340
Saudi Arabia yes you heard that right I

106
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,050
am not pulling your leg and pay

107
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,030
attention because this story is

108
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,130
absolutely priceless

109
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,960
basically the Lebanese prime minister

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,330
Saud Hariri was visiting bin Salman so

111
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,230
far so good

112
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,210
Saudi Arabia and Lebanon their longtime

113
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,220
allies so it's normal for their leaders

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,990
to visit each other from time to time at

115
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,790
least this is what mr. Harare thought

116
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,590
when he was taking a walk in the

117
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,480
countryside with his friends the Saudi

118
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,370
Crown Prince but it turns out that with

119
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,600
all they met each other a policeman

120
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,370
comes up to hurry takes his mobile phone

121
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,350
and hands him a resignation letter this

122
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,150
is when bin Salman comes along and says

123
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,370
yo what's up Harry here's what's gonna

124
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,840
happen you're gonna stand in front of

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
these cameras and you're gonna resign

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,070
right now as Prime Minister or I'm just

127
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,780
not gonna let you leave Saudi Arabia

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,240
you're basically kidnapped you know so

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,380
do what you will

130
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,460
now as you might imagine from this

131
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,810
eleven E's government asked for help

132
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,790
from Western diplomats and after a lot

133
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,530
of talking and negotiation many of those

134
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,570
diplomats they went to Saudi Arabia and

135
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,400
they brought the Prime Minister back

136
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,200
home

137
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,670
all right so okay all of this happened

138
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,770
way back in 2017 and we're recording

139
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,460
this video in early 2019 well since then

140
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,620
bin Salman has created even worse

141
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,540
scandals for example we have the

142
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,770
khashoggi affair

143
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,570
Jamarcus shaggy was a Saudi journalist

144
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,520
allegedly assassinated by his government

145
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,890
because of his criticism of bin Salman

146
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,480
but you know this already because it was

147
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,100
on the front page of newspapers all

148
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,870
around the world however as you know

149
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,460
here a visual politic we like to tell

150
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,260
you about the stories that aren't on the

151
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,910
front pages so the question we asked

152
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,340
today is what's going on between Saudi

153
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,470
Arabia and Lebanon why on earth did bin

154
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,000
someone kidnap the Lebanese Prime

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,230
Minister well today we're going to

156
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,670
answer these questions but before we do

157
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,120
let's take a look back at the history

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,490
the Switzerland of the Middle East in

159
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,680
the Year 1943 Lebanon gained

160
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,780
independence from France and from the

161
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,460
beginning Lebanon was one of the few

162
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,170
democracies in the area but not only

163
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,120
that they were also an example of

164
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,890
tolerance among different religions

165
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,480
according to their constitution the

166
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,460
President must be Christian the prime

167
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,380
minister must be a Sunni Muslim and the

168
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,570
president of the Parliament must be a

169
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,370
Shia Muslim so with all the major

170
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,320
religions having their power quota they

171
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,170
should be happy right well no the

172
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,330
opposite is actually true in the Year

173
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,460
1975 tensions between Muslim and

174
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,950
Christians they exploded this is how the

175
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,230
Lebanese civil war started

176
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,470
[Music]

177
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,870
this was a civil war where the Palestine

178
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,030
Liberation Front Muslim fighters Druze

179
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,920
fighters and Christian groups all fought

180
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,540
each other this is the time when many

181
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,070
Lebanese citizens that you might have

182
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,020
heard of fled the country for example if

183
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,670
you're a fan of Nazim Taylor he was one

184
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,440
of those Lebanese that left the country

185
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,700
because of the war and make no mistake

186
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,710
we're not talking about a small war here

187
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,780
in the end 1982 those Palestinians

188
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,210
living in Lebanon attacked Israel and

189
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,400
Israel answered those attacks with an

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,970
invasion

191
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,680
[Music]

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,630
but if he can imagine the Israelis they

193
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,550
did not come alone they were supported

194
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,310
by Italy by France and of course by the

195
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,410
United States of America this conflict

196
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,440
it didn't stop until the year 1990 15

197
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
years of violence that destroyed the

198
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,600
Lebanese economy since then Lebanon has

199
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,000
had an 80 billion dollar debt further

200
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,350
the Army's lesson recovered and the

201
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,570
government's authority is under scrutiny

202
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,120
[Music]

203
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,460
in many ways we could say that neither

204
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,440
Don is a failed state the government

205
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,480
reaches only 2/3 of the nation and the

206
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,669
rest of the country is immersed in

207
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,280
constant conflicts with warlords and now

208
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
I'll ask you to guess who Lebanon's main

209
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,100
ally is of course Saudi Arabia they are

210
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,020
the main power in the area and they're

211
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,419
the ones sending the money and all kinds

212
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,130
of aid but hold on a minute because as

213
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,930
you know Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim

214
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,960
country and who are the Sunni Muslims

215
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,389
worst enemy of course that's the Shia

216
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,040
Muslims so now I guess he's one of the

217
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,570
most important political parties in

218
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,520
Lebanon well that's something when you

219
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,950
explore right now-she

220
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,190
[Music]

221
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,979
warriors let's get back to that Lebanese

222
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,500
civil war in the in 1982 a group of Shia

223
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,630
clerics created Hezbollah a terrorist

224
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,790
group whose purpose was to kick Israel

225
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,440
out of the country in turn Lebanon into

226
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,050
a Muslim country

227
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,940
if you've been following visual politic

228
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,470
for a long time you already know that

229
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,170
Iran supports any Shia Muslim groups so

230
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,580
from the very beginning Hezbollah was

231
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,470
given money and military training from

232
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,570
Tehran this is why during the 1980s

233
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,460
Hezbollah improved its tactics it became

234
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,440
Israel's worst nightmare in many ways we

235
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,720
could say Hezbollah is a parallel army

236
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,370
they're very well organized and they've

237
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,930
got training that gives them nothing to

238
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,400
envy about the Israeli army

239
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
hence this group survived the Lebanese

240
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,090
civil war in fact they kept organizing

241
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,560
terrorist attacks until the moment when

242
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,690
Israel abandoned Lebanon in the year

243
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:13,140
2000 but the story doesn't stop here you

244
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,880
might remember the second Lebanese war

245
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,460
of 2006 this started when Hezbollah

246
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,680
wanted Israel to free three Lebanese

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,350
prisoners this is how a 34 day war

248
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,050
started it was a war that ended with the

249
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,420
lives of more than a thousand or have

250
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,880
any citizens being lost the Western

251
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,650
media treated this conflict as just

252
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,830
another chapter in the never-ending

253
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,110
arab-israeli clashes but within the Arab

254
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,530
world

255
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,200
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah became

256
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,780
a rock star the man who could face

257
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,940
Israel and survive

258
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,840
[Music]

259
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,490
that said let's fast forward our history

260
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,160
to the year 2011 the year of the Arab

261
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,840
Spring a moment when the Islamic world

262
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,600
demanded a change at first Hezbollah was

263
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,280
a big fan of all the uprisings in

264
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,260
countries like Egypt Libya and Tunisia

265
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,600
those countries they had Arab socialist

266
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,400
dictators who were far from friendly was

267
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,280
sheer Islam but oh boy did things change

268
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,980
in Syria the Syrian President Bashar

269
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,560
al-assad is a Shia Muslim meaning he's

270
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,570
an ally of Iran and therefore a good

271
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,700
ally of Hezbollah so suddenly these

272
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,430
freedom fighters in Syria became Sunni

273
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,250
conspirators in Hezbollah sighs and this

274
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,290
is why in the year 2012 Hezbollah

275
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,270
fighters went to Syria to support their

276
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,530
friend al Assad

277
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,600
this military campaign helps Hezbollah

278
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,759
gain a lot of popular support in Lebanon

279
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,440
meanwhile Lebanon was arguably in

280
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,870
anarchy for two years they didn't even

281
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,459
have a president you see there's a

282
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,889
golden rule in politics a rule that you

283
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,750
can never ignore power does not allow

284
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,029
vacuums so having no clear power in

285
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:00,100
Lebanon Hezbollah appeared as the only

286
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,410
organized force ready to seize the

287
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,890
opportunity

288
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,600
[Music]

289
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,060
in the year 2016 Lebanon finally had a

290
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,579
president McHale our own of course mr.

291
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,170
Owen was a Christian because according

292
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,480
to the constitution he had to be but his

293
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
political party was a clear ally of

294
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
Hezbollah so did you member sad

295
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,060
al-hariri well he was already the Prime

296
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,709
Minister and if you remember the

297
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,329
Lebanese Constitution states that the

298
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:26,699
prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim

299
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,649
therefore mr. Herrera was Sony Muslim or

300
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,629
in other words Saudi Arabia's ally in

301
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:33,550
the country the only person in Lebanese

302
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,290
politics who could stop the advance of

303
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,240
Hezbollah but was he really willing to

304
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,089
do this well let's just carry on with

305
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,339
the story shall we already lists as you

306
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,870
can imagine if Hezbollah controls

307
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,149
Lebanon Iran will have a lot of sway in

308
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,220
the country and as you can imagine Saudi

309
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,589
Arabia does not like that idea

310
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,720
that's why bin Salman was pressing

311
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,699
al-hariri to do everything he could to

312
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:00,009
stop Hezbollah and believe me there are

313
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,050
thousands of ways you can press a

314
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,209
Lebanese Prime Minister for example more

315
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,459
than 250 thousand Lebanese people live

316
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,500
and work in Saudi Arabia you just need

317
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,540
to deport all of them at once and all of

318
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,370
a sudden the Lebanese economy has a bit

319
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,860
of a problem but not even the threat of

320
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,500
this was a problem to hurry just think

321
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,209
about it Lebanon is a country that's

322
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,220
gone through to a fairly recent wars

323
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,560
there are economies already devastated

324
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,449
and they've got better things to do

325
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:27,069
right now than take care of geopolitical

326
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,709
tensions of other countries and this

327
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:35,269
explains declarations like this one

328
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,190
Hezbollah is in Syria and Iraq and Yemen

329
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,620
so people should not focus on Hezbollah

330
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,959
that it's a Lebanese entity only but

331
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,670
something regional I'm the prime

332
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,500
minister of Lebanon I'm not going to

333
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,480
enter into that regional conflict all I

334
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,029
want is to how to safeguard my country

335
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,089
Saud al-hariri speaking to Politico in

336
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,829
other words it means Harry's position is

337
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,089
anything but simple

338
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,550
yes his main ally is Saudi Arabia but on

339
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,589
the other hand he is the prime minister

340
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:04,620
of Lebanon so when words in work bin

341
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,779
Salman resorted to rather more extreme

342
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,040
measures

343
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,270
Lebanese Prime Minister al-hariri

344
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,910
kidnapped by Saudis country's president

345
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,650
says of course when you get them but

346
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,750
Prime Minister you know you can't keep

347
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,490
him for too long as we've said the

348
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,600
beginning of this video the

349
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,160
international community pressed been

350
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,380
summoned to free her arey but when

351
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,820
you're the prime minister of a country

352
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,350
and your main ally is just kidnap to you

353
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,810
your political capital it drops to zero

354
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,270
so well what happens after that

355
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,340
well bin Salman has tried to pretend

356
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,290
that nothing happens kidnapping

357
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,660
what kidnapping is pretty much his

358
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,580
response indeed he has even made some

359
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,800
jokes about it but hurry he can't make

360
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,550
jokes anymore

361
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,070
he lost all credibility to his voters

362
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,380
and this includes all of his power to

363
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,390
stop Hezbollah this is why it's no

364
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,730
surprise that in the 2018 legislative

365
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,270
elections the result was as follows

366
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,950
Lebanon election Hezbollah leader

367
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,320
declares victory yep you guessed it

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,840
Harry's party has really been hit by the

369
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,750
crisis and Hezbollah despite not being

370
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,550
the main party in the parliaments has

371
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,260
