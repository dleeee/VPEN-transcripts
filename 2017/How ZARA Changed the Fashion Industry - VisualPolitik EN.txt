spend a hundred and twenty five billion

22
00:00:44.55 --> 00:00:48.050
dollars to make the acquisition

23
00:00:49.65 --> 00:00:54.030
company name might be unfamiliar to some

of you but I am sure you will recognize

25
00:00:54.03 --> 00:00:57.420
in many of its fashion labels look

26
00:00:55.89 --> 00:00:59.430
inside this corporation and you'll find

27
00:00:57.42 --> 00:01:01.950
such well-known brands as Zara Pullum

Bear Bershka Massimo Dutti Stradivarius

00:01:01.95 --> 00:01:05.850
voice show Zara home or Turk where and

30
00:01:04.44 --> 00:01:11.040
although smaller you can also find

31
00:01:05.85 --> 00:01:13.080
lefties of their low-cost brands but the

32
00:01:11.04 --> 00:01:15.540
flagship brands of this corporation is

33
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:17.520
definitely Zara I'm sure you know it it

has stores open in almost every country

35
00:01:17.52 --> 00:01:22.500
around the world and it is here in Zara

36
00:01:19.68 --> 00:01:24.720
where the corporation makes 60% of its

37
00:01:22.5 --> 00:01:26.340
total sales but the most striking thing

38
00:01:24.72 --> 00:01:28.320
here is not just the figures it's the

39
00:01:26.34 --> 00:01:30.150
company's evolution in just a few years

40
00:01:28.32 --> 00:01:32.340
into Texas turns into the world's

41
00:01:30.15 --> 00:01:34.680
largest text or group with stores on the

42
00:01:32.34 --> 00:01:36.960
most expensive streets in the world and

43
00:01:34.68 --> 00:01:37.510
it all started as a modest Spanish

44
00:01:36.96 --> 00:01:46.200
company

45
00:01:37.51 --> 00:01:46.200
[Music]

46
00:01:46.3 --> 00:01:50.650
this kind of thing might be less unusual

47
00:01:48.58 --> 00:01:52.630
in a country like the USA but I can

48
00:01:50.65 --> 00:01:54.760
assure you it's ratifying such a

49
00:01:52.63 --> 00:01:56.290
phenomenon in Spain that is why we're

50
00:01:54.76 --> 00:01:58.450
going to analyze into text today from

51
00:01:56.29 --> 00:02:00.940
its humble beginnings through the keys

52
00:01:58.45 --> 00:02:02.140
to its success and of course well its

53
00:02:00.94 --> 00:02:06.560
immense profits

54
00:02:02.14 --> 00:02:06.560
[Music]

55
00:02:10.47 --> 00:02:14.550
the origins of a giant

00:02:12.8 --> 00:02:16.770
[Music]

57
00:02:14.55 --> 00:02:18.390
to know the origins of intersex we must

58
00:02:16.77 --> 00:02:20.970
go back to the 70s when Spanish

59
00:02:18.39 --> 00:02:22.920
businessman Amancio Ortega opens the

60
00:02:20.97 --> 00:02:24.450
first Zara store now you might be

61
00:02:22.92 --> 00:02:25.980
wondering where to draw Tiger get the

62
00:02:24.45 --> 00:02:30.060
inspiration to start up such a

63
00:02:25.98 --> 00:02:32.160
profitable moneymaker well it's

64
00:02:30.06 --> 00:02:33.630
difficult to say but we do know this man

65
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:36.000
has been involved with the fashion

66
00:02:33.63 --> 00:02:38.190
industry from a very young age when he

67
00:02:36.0 --> 00:02:40.230
was only 14 he was already working as a

68
00:02:38.19 --> 00:02:42.120
delivery boy for a well-known shirt shop

69
00:02:40.23 --> 00:02:43.170
in a small industrial city in the north

70
00:02:42.12 --> 00:02:45.150
of Spain yep

71
00:02:43.17 --> 00:02:47.010
times have absolutely changed back then

72
00:02:45.15 --> 00:02:49.140
Spain was very different to how it is

73
00:02:47.01 --> 00:02:51.360
now it was a much poorer country and it

74
00:02:49.14 --> 00:02:55.110
wasn't unusual to find a 14 year old in

75
00:02:51.36 --> 00:02:57.120
employment but let's focus here a thing

76
00:02:55.11 --> 00:02:59.220
or Tagus saw was a clear business

77
00:02:57.12 --> 00:03:01.470
opportunity and he soon decided to make

78
00:02:59.22 --> 00:03:03.740
his mark on the international market in

79
00:03:01.47 --> 00:03:06.240
1988 he opened his first store outside

80
00:03:03.74 --> 00:03:08.610
Spanish borders in Porto in Portugal

81
00:03:06.24 --> 00:03:10.830
soon after he crossed the Atlantic and

82
00:03:08.61 --> 00:03:13.080
set foot in New York and he has been

83
00:03:10.83 --> 00:03:15.300
unstoppable since then the UK Japan

84
00:03:13.08 --> 00:03:17.340
Kuwait right now you can find an

85
00:03:15.3 --> 00:03:19.700
intersect store in almost every large

86
00:03:17.34 --> 00:03:23.130
city and capital city in the world

87
00:03:19.7 --> 00:03:25.110
Inditex brand owner of Zara and Bershka

88
00:03:23.13 --> 00:03:28.140
plans to open stores in Vietnam

89
00:03:25.11 --> 00:03:30.030
New Zealand Paraguay Aruba and Nicaragua

90
00:03:28.14 --> 00:03:33.000
this year the voice of Vietnam today in

91
00:03:30.03 --> 00:03:34.950
DES X has more than 7,300 stores across

92
00:03:33.0 --> 00:03:37.050
the globe its main markets where Inditex

93
00:03:34.95 --> 00:03:39.239
has more shops outside Spain than in are

94
00:03:37.05 --> 00:03:41.160
China and Russia as you can imagine all

95
00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.890
of this international expansion well it

96
00:03:41.16 --> 00:03:45.720
certainly had a reward Ortega that

97
00:03:43.89 --> 00:03:48.030
Charles who saw no other choice but to

98
00:03:45.72 --> 00:03:50.250
work to survive and to founded in Tex

99
00:03:48.03 --> 00:03:52.320
when he was almost 40 is today one of

100
00:03:50.25 --> 00:03:54.540
the wealthiest people on earth according

101
00:03:52.32 --> 00:03:58.020
to Forbes Ortega's fortune is more than

102
00:03:54.54 --> 00:04:00.120
55 billion dollars and well there is the

103
00:03:58.02 --> 00:04:00.510
billion dollar question well how did he

104
00:04:00.12 --> 00:04:03.830
do it

105
00:04:00.51 --> 00:04:03.830
well let's take a look at that

106
00:04:06.8 --> 00:04:10.400
the keys to success

107
00:04:10.95 --> 00:04:13.800
to those who say that innovation is

108
00:04:12.69 --> 00:04:15.510
limited the realms of the high-tech

109
00:04:13.8 --> 00:04:17.370
industry well you probably don't know

110
00:04:15.51 --> 00:04:18.750
about Inditex and pay attention here

111
00:04:17.37 --> 00:04:21.090
because we're going to look at how this

112
00:04:18.75 --> 00:04:23.520
company has turned the entire textile

113
00:04:21.09 --> 00:04:27.800
industry upside down by competing in a

114
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:27.800
very different way to rival companies

115
00:04:28.51 --> 00:04:32.260
the whole textile industry thing it

116
00:04:30.49 --> 00:04:34.450
doesn't exactly sound incredibly

117
00:04:32.26 --> 00:04:36.760
groundbreaking does is because well this

118
00:04:34.45 --> 00:04:39.160
company they've achieved immense growth

119
00:04:36.76 --> 00:04:42.010
growth which can mainly be attributed to

120
00:04:39.16 --> 00:04:44.140
innovation by daring to be different now

121
00:04:42.01 --> 00:04:46.420
let's analyze in depth some of the keys

122
00:04:44.14 --> 00:04:47.740
to its business success first well we

123
00:04:46.42 --> 00:04:49.840
need to pay attention to the company's

124
00:04:47.74 --> 00:04:51.550
brain yes in today's does have some sort

125
00:04:49.84 --> 00:04:53.260
of brain and this is the operation room

126
00:04:51.55 --> 00:04:55.390
that the company established in our tea

127
00:04:53.26 --> 00:04:57.400
show a small town in Galicia

128
00:04:55.39 --> 00:04:59.770
now you could be forgiven for mistaking

129
00:04:57.4 --> 00:05:02.140
this is some sort of NASA control room

130
00:04:59.77 --> 00:05:04.060
but at least for now no rockets or

131
00:05:02.14 --> 00:05:06.430
satellites are managed from here in this

132
00:05:04.06 --> 00:05:08.050
room they control and analyze everything

133
00:05:06.43 --> 00:05:10.420
that takes place across all of the

134
00:05:08.05 --> 00:05:11.860
company's stores in real time you see

135
00:05:10.42 --> 00:05:13.810
even though a large part of the clothing

136
00:05:11.86 --> 00:05:15.460
production takes place in countries like

137
00:05:13.81 --> 00:05:17.950
Morocco Turkey Brazil or Bangladesh

138
00:05:15.46 --> 00:05:19.840
everything or almost everything goes

139
00:05:17.95 --> 00:05:22.060
through Spain before it is sent to

140
00:05:19.84 --> 00:05:23.890
stores for instance let's think about a

141
00:05:22.06 --> 00:05:25.510
Zara storm in Shanghai it would be

142
00:05:23.89 --> 00:05:27.190
logical for us to think that since the

143
00:05:25.51 --> 00:05:29.320
clothes are made in Bangladesh that they

144
00:05:27.19 --> 00:05:31.540
should be sent directly to China from

145
00:05:29.32 --> 00:05:33.490
there right well that's not what happens

146
00:05:31.54 --> 00:05:35.770
at all they're actually taken to Spain

147
00:05:33.49 --> 00:05:38.290
and then they are sent back to Asia this

148
00:05:35.77 --> 00:05:41.400
might seem counterintuitive but it does

149
00:05:38.29 --> 00:05:41.400
have an explanation

150
00:05:41.64 --> 00:05:45.350
[Music]

151
00:05:42.98 --> 00:05:46.970
not all shops sell the same quantity of

152
00:05:45.35 --> 00:05:48.920
each type of clothing the purpose of

153
00:05:46.97 --> 00:05:51.200
this operation room is to control how

154
00:05:48.92 --> 00:05:53.120
much is sold and what kind of pieces are

155
00:05:51.2 --> 00:05:55.100
sent to each of the group's shops a

156
00:05:53.12 --> 00:05:58.080
model the color the size etc

157
00:05:55.1 --> 00:06:00.150
[Music]

158
00:05:58.08 --> 00:06:01.500
so considering this data the stores

159
00:06:00.15 --> 00:06:03.270
receive pieces of clothing as

160
00:06:01.5 --> 00:06:05.610
appropriate for their individual needs

161
00:06:03.27 --> 00:06:07.620
it is only logical for example that the

162
00:06:05.61 --> 00:06:09.479
Zara on Fifth Avenue does not sell the

163
00:06:07.62 --> 00:06:13.199
same items that the Zara's of Miami

164
00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:15.479
Beach or Ibiza do the second key to

165
00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.830
success is logistics which is closely

166
00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.289
related to the first one

167
00:06:16.83 --> 00:06:21.090
look Inditex supplies its doors to or

168
00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.310
even three times a week and they can

169
00:06:21.09 --> 00:06:25.919
deliver to any of their stores in just

170
00:06:23.31 --> 00:06:27.479
48 hours you can imagine what enough of

171
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.099
this requires but with this timing the

172
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.620
company gets several things in return

173
00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.900
they reduce stock in storage and reduce

174
00:06:31.62 --> 00:06:36.060
the storage space required in the shops

175
00:06:33.9 --> 00:06:38.219
less stock means less frozen money and

176
00:06:36.06 --> 00:06:43.770
less storage space means more space for

177
00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:45.870
sales and in all of this means well of

178
00:06:43.77 --> 00:06:47.909
course that means more money furthermore

179
00:06:45.87 --> 00:06:49.889
it also helps to have an updated sales

180
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.710
line and this by the way is the third

181
00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:58.620
key to Indy Texas success no more

182
00:06:52.71 --> 00:07:00.719
lasting collections in this company if

183
00:06:58.62 --> 00:07:02.789
the clothes are often renewed on average

184
00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:04.740
every fortnight so if a certain type of

185
00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.419
t-shirt is not selling it's out just

186
00:07:04.74 --> 00:07:08.039
like that it vanishes from the shelves

187
00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:09.719
never to be seen again however if a

188
00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.400
piece of clothing is selling well the

189
00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:13.020
customer knows he won't finds many

190
00:07:11.4 --> 00:07:15.330
people wearing the same product because

191
00:07:13.02 --> 00:07:17.430
its production is limited to a short

192
00:07:15.33 --> 00:07:19.020
period of time so when something is

193
00:07:17.43 --> 00:07:20.969
popular in it sells well the company

194
00:07:19.02 --> 00:07:23.219
doesn't provide more of these items what

195
00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:25.529
the designers do is they sort of recycle

196
00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.930
the model the essence is kept but some

197
00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:30.360
modifications are made so they follow

198
00:07:27.93 --> 00:07:32.219
the trend but they don't repeat it it

199
00:07:30.36 --> 00:07:33.840
all explains why every time we walk into

200
00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.729
one of these shops most of what we see

201
00:07:33.84 --> 00:07:37.500
is different to the products we saw the

202
00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.629
last time so to sum up with the

203
00:07:37.5 --> 00:07:41.610
operation room daily analysis logistics

204
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:43.440
new designs well this company it's

205
00:07:41.61 --> 00:07:45.719
starting to not sound that traditional

206
00:07:43.44 --> 00:07:47.699
isn't it but I'm sure you probably want

207
00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:50.990
to know more about those huge figures so

208
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.990
well let's jump into that now

209
00:07:51.38 --> 00:08:02.470
[Music]

210
00:07:57.4 --> 00:08:04.780
the large figures if there were three

211
00:08:02.47 --> 00:08:06.910
words to define this enormous player of

212
00:08:04.78 --> 00:08:08.770
the fashion industry these would be well

213
00:08:06.91 --> 00:08:10.510
growth growth and yeah the third word

214
00:08:08.77 --> 00:08:12.160
would also be growth now we've discussed

215
00:08:10.51 --> 00:08:14.110
the main keys that have helped to build

216
00:08:12.16 --> 00:08:16.120
this Empire so now let's see what's

217
00:08:14.11 --> 00:08:17.440
going on within the company and to do

218
00:08:16.12 --> 00:08:23.260
this we need to take a look at the

219
00:08:17.44 --> 00:08:25.479
period between 2006 and 2016 in only ten

220
00:08:23.26 --> 00:08:27.940
years Inditex has been able to multiply

221
00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:30.010
their sales by three they've doubled the

222
00:08:27.94 --> 00:08:33.150
number of stores and they've expanded to

223
00:08:30.01 --> 00:08:33.150
50 new countries

224
00:08:33.18 --> 00:08:38.070
not so bad for just ten years right well

225
00:08:36.18 --> 00:08:39.930
in previous videos like the one we did

226
00:08:38.07 --> 00:08:42.420
on Amazon we said we like to highlight

227
00:08:39.93 --> 00:08:43.980
the real money a company generates that

228
00:08:42.42 --> 00:08:46.020
is the difference between the money that

229
00:08:43.98 --> 00:08:48.270
comes in and the money that goes out the

230
00:08:46.02 --> 00:08:50.220
cash flow well if we do it again for

231
00:08:48.27 --> 00:08:52.740
Inditex we can see that cash flow has

232
00:08:50.22 --> 00:08:54.750
multiplied by three in the last ten

233
00:08:52.74 --> 00:08:57.360
years if we look at the numbers we see

234
00:08:54.75 --> 00:09:00.000
how this real profit has gone from 1.4

235
00:08:57.36 --> 00:09:02.520
billion euros to four billion euros

236
00:09:00.0 --> 00:09:05.670
every year in other words mr. Ortega

237
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:07.380
system it certainly works and this does

238
00:09:05.67 --> 00:09:09.570
not just work great for shareholders

239
00:09:07.38 --> 00:09:12.000
because Inditex has been an absolute

240
00:09:09.57 --> 00:09:14.550
employment machine this company now has

241
00:09:12.0 --> 00:09:16.230
more than a hundred and sixty thousand

242
00:09:14.55 --> 00:09:18.030
workers around the world but that's not

243
00:09:16.23 --> 00:09:19.860
the end of it not even close because if

244
00:09:18.03 --> 00:09:22.140
we bear in mind all the suppliers that

245
00:09:19.86 --> 00:09:25.580
Inditex works with that number could be

246
00:09:22.14 --> 00:09:29.309
in excess of eight million workers

247
00:09:25.58 --> 00:09:29.309
[Music]

248
00:09:29.35 --> 00:09:33.100
million people that in one way or

249
00:09:31.45 --> 00:09:35.470
another have a job because of a company

250
00:09:33.1 --> 00:09:37.810
that was born in the 1970s in a small

251
00:09:35.47 --> 00:09:39.640
city in the north of Spain a company

252
00:09:37.81 --> 00:09:41.740
that was founded by a humble man a

253
00:09:39.64 --> 00:09:43.530
worker with ambition it's all very

254
00:09:41.74 --> 00:09:44.670
impressive

255
00:09:43.53 --> 00:09:46.460
[Applause]

256
00:09:44.67 --> 00:09:48.620
[Music]

257
00:09:46.46 --> 00:09:50.420
and that is why Watauga has become an

258
00:09:48.62 --> 00:09:52.580
idol for many young Spanish school

259
00:09:50.42 --> 00:09:53.480
students they aspire to be like him when

260
00:09:52.58 --> 00:09:55.940
they grow up

261
00:09:53.48 --> 00:09:58.850
spanish high school students want to be

262
00:09:55.94 --> 00:10:00.440
like Amancio Ortega in the future anyway

263
00:09:58.85 --> 00:10:02.300
now it's your turn do you often find

264
00:10:00.44 --> 00:10:03.260
yourself shopping in Inditex stores even

265
00:10:02.3 --> 00:10:05.510
though maybe I've never heard of it

266
00:10:03.26 --> 00:10:07.760
before and what's your opinion on Ortega

267
00:10:05.51 --> 00:10:09.920
