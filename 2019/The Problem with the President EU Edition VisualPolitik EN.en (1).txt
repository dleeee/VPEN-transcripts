3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,190
let me ask you a question do you know

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,410
this woman her name is Ursula von der

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,029
Leyen and I got to confess that never

6
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:16,129
heard of her until about a month ago man

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,199
there's not just Nene that most other

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,089
European know this woman's about to

9
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:24,020
become the next EU Commission president

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,010
[Music]

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,470
she would be the equivalent of Donald

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,150
Trump in the European Union the most

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,280
powerful person in Europe this is

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,690
already official well I remember the

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,199
first she will take the oath and okay

16
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:39,430
okay I know what you're thinking

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,320
especially those of you who voted in the

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,989
European elections I mean here is this

19
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,540
woman where did she come from why her

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,940
well I think Eric can give us a bit more

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,370
information of course Simon as you know

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,489
on May 20 19 your pians went to the

23
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,440
polling stations choose the members of

24
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,670
the European Parliament

25
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,970
[Music]

26
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,680
these are legislative elections for the

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,570
EU as a whole and in many ways are

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,370
similar to the midterms in the United

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,290
States with the parliamentary elections

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,960
in the UK so the name of ursula von der

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,020
Leyen wasn't on any ballot back then she

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,910
was just the defense minister of Germany

33
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,670
Germans knew her but other Europeans not

34
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,320
so much I know you're thinking this

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,600
process is completely legal in EU

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,970
elections Europeans don't get to choose

37
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,250
the executive power just the legislative

38
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,119
one

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,860
so technically anybody could become

40
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,320
president of the Commission as long as

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,020
the Parliament accepts him or her in

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,119
other words this is totally possible law

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,670
wise the politics wise it's kind of a

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,760
bit weird

45
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,500
[Music]

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,450
just to give an example many people in

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,480
the UK complained about Bojo also known

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,460
as Boris Johnson becoming the prime

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,980
minister but to be fair Johnson is well

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,120
known and he was a member of

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,620
Parliament's the situation with

52
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,240
Wonderland would be like choosing the

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,230
mayor of Liverpool as Prime Minister

54
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,810
just because and yes it's true Vonda

55
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,880
Lyons appointment is a historical event

56
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,580
she will be the first woman to rule over

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,990
Europe her name will appear next to

58
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,390
other pioneers like Angela Merkel and

59
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,580
Margaret Thatcher and maybe she'll

60
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,980
become a big historical figure just like

61
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,770
them she might even be a great president

62
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,470
but today's question is can we say the

63
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,810
European Union is a real democracy if

64
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,150
von der Leyen was chosen without being

65
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,280
voted in what's the EU Commission's

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,350
president's role well today we are

67
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,910
absolutely going to answer those

68
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,370
questions I mean we always do but before

69
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,410
we do would do what we always do as well

70
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,610
and let's take a look at the history

71
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,220
[Music]

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,940
the brussels bubble in the year 1992 the

73
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,830
Maastricht Treaty was signed

74
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,450
we could say that this was the moment

75
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,490
when the European Union with its capital

76
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,340
of Brussels started until that moment

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,380
the European single market was only what

78
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,170
the name suggested a market it was just

79
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,090
this big old free trade agreement that

80
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,040
included almost all of western and

81
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,530
southern Europe but it has almost no

82
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,600
political power the European Union was a

83
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,700
giant step because it meant that now all

84
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,920
of those countries would be bonded by a

85
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,590
common governance years later creations

86
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,140
like the euro currency the Schengen area

87
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,330
and many other treaties were all

88
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,430
possible and you might be wondering can

89
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,100
we say that the EU is similar to the

90
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,530
u.s. does it work as a federation as a

91
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,960
confederation well it's hard to say in

92
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,270
fact European institutions are really a

93
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,090
bit hard to understand and usually the

94
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,650
media it doesn't really help with this

95
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,990
you often hear news saying like Brussels

96
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,050
said this or Brussels demands that but

97
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,630
in fact there are three institutions in

98
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,610
Brussels and all three are different

99
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,720
from one another and they all have

100
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,930
different roles

101
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,819
don't worry you can understand it all

102
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,579
very easily with an example that you all

103
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,260
know about because it's been smashed

104
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,790
over your head a dozen times and that's

105
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,329
article 13 but just in case you didn't

106
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,760
know article 13 is the common name for

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,459
that EU copyright directive that affects

108
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,130
youtubers a great deal like I say I'm

109
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,470
sure you have absolutely heard about it

110
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,250
many many many many times but this time

111
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,080
let's not focus on what it's said but

112
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,270
instead let's look at how it got passed

113
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,580
it all starts with the European Council

114
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,199
this is the place where the Prime

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,970
Minister's of all the EU member

116
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,620
countries come together and say like

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,870
alright guys what we're gonna do is

118
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,889
we're gonna need some sort of

119
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,870
legislation to regulate on like

120
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,149
copyright right

121
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,349
they will write some general guidelines

122
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:48,939
and then they send it to the next dude

123
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:50,709
the European Commission the Commission

124
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,479
will sort of be the equivalent of the

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,819
White House or Downing Street this is

126
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,859
the executive power in Europe they have

127
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,629
a president vice-president and some

128
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,189
commissioners that are similar to a

129
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:05,139
minister or a Secretary of State these

130
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,939
guys they read the guidelines written by

131
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,919
the council and they write a legislative

132
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,499
proposal which would be the first draft

133
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,969
for legislation once they're finished

134
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:14,019
with that they send it to the

135
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,359
legislative body which is the European

136
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,009
Parliament this Parliament works in a

137
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,869
very similar fashion to the US Capitol

138
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,329
or the House of Commons but in the UK it

139
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,879
has something unique its members cannot

140
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,559
come up with their own ideas they can

141
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,659
only discuss the proposals sent in by

142
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,489
the Commission for example in the u.s.

143
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:33,129
occasi Cortes is only a congresswoman

144
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,509
but she can come up with a green new

145
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,829
deal and try to make it pass through

146
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,889
Congress a European MP couldn't this

147
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:41,289
means that the EU Parliament is much

148
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:43,299
weaker than a normal one so coming back

149
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,459
to that article 13 thing after the

150
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,289
European Parliament discusses thick they

151
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,209
come up with their own version of the

152
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,610
law but there are still so many details

153
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,499
to polish if you remember the video we

154
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,439
made about article 13 a small detail and

155
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,209
a piece of legislation can change an

156
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,610
entire industry

157
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,639
[Music]

158
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,879
this is well we get the trial ox

159
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,009
trilogue is a process where

160
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,689
representatives from those three

161
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,639
institutions the council the Commission

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,740
and the parliaments they meet again and

163
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,300
they discuss the door and finally we

164
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,819
have the final the polished the

165
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,490
discussed legislation the final stage is

166
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,770
when the trial log sends this law back

167
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,560
to the parliaments in this case the MEP

168
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,810
s can vote yes or no but they can't

169
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,440
propose any more amendments

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,870
[Music]

171
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,000
so as we said before in this system the

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,620
Commission has a loss of power because

173
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,810
they are the only ones who can send a

174
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,880
legislative draft to the parliaments

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,099
this is why this is such an important

176
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,080
question who gets to choose the

177
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,180
president of the Commission and this

178
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,810
this is where the big debate starts the

179
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,419
president is chosen by the EU Council

180
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,030
and ratified by the Parliament that is

181
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,440
the Prime Minister's of all the EU

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,789
countries get to decide who the

183
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,900
president will be and then the

184
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,210
Parliament votes in favor or against

185
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,860
this leaves the Parliament in a very

186
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,840
weak position because they can only say

187
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,770
yay or nay but again they cannot propose

188
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,319
anybody and this is why five years ago

189
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,750
some politicians proposed the spits and

190
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,060
candid Artin system in this system each

191
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,560
political party running for the

192
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,750
elections must have one candidate for

193
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,200
president

194
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,570
Zelo say if you vote for the Social

195
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,550
Democrats you know that they'll fight

196
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,070
for this specific candidate to be the EU

197
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,200
president sounds pretty fair right well

198
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,480
there is a bit of a problem many

199
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,610
political parties just don't agree with

200
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,110
us let me think about it right now the

201
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,030
council can choose anybody to be

202
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,310
President with this proposed system the

203
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,530
Spitz and candidate thing they can only

204
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,960
choose from a very short list that's

205
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,390
proposed by the parties a few years this

206
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,340
fits and candidate system became a sort

207
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,280
of gentlemen's deal parties followed the

208
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,990
system but it wasn't really written down

209
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,199
anywhere

210
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,330
this is how former EU President

211
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,240
jean-claude ianka was elected in 2014 he

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,979
made his a coalition government between

213
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,199
Social Democrats and the People's Party

214
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,819
and now you might be wondering how what

215
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,430
happened during the 2019 elections Simon

216
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,259
well what usually happens with

217
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,469
gentlemen's deals some gentlemen just so

218
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,210
happen to break them in this case these

219
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,800
Social Democrats in the People's Party

220
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,089
didn't have enough seats to make a

221
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,709
government they needed the support of

222
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,539
the Liberals and liberals don't want the

223
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,339
Spitz and Gander Darton system but why

224
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,139
not and why did they end up choosing the

225
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,550
German Defense Minister

226
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:49,389
well that's have a look shall we but

227
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:52,300
it's in Candide Otton no mercy in

228
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,760
Brussels they call it the EU top five

229
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,980
jobs the five most powerful political

230
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,260
positions those positions are the

231
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,850
president of the Commission the vice

232
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,500
president who deals with Foreign Affairs

233
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,880
the president of the Parliament

234
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,350
President of the Council and the

235
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,329
President of the European Central Bank

236
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,790
these five guys opened a restaurant that

237
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,500
serves burgers don't know they didn't

238
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,790
they're the ultimate decision makers in

239
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,579
Europe so the question is who gets to

240
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,980
choose them and the answer is again the

241
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,199
council and again the council is made up

242
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,610
of the prime ministers of all of the

243
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,589
member countries then they need the

244
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,420
approval of the parliaments with the

245
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,519
spit sink and a Darton system they would

246
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,260
have a bigger say in this because at

247
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,449
least parties can say the eligible

248
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,820
candidates are so who's in favor of this

249
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,649
well of course is the biggest political

250
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,350
parties what a surprise but who's

251
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,810
against it I'll think about it

252
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,720
[Music]

253
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,329
groans party rejects spits in candidate

254
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,339
process macaron the French president

255
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,860
belongs to the Liberal Party which is in

256
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,260
the third group in other words not a big

257
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,930
deal but as the president of the second

258
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,550
biggest country in Europe he has a

259
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,620
strong position on the council basically

260
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,449
having the second largest economy in the

261
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:02,310
Union gives you a lot of leverage to

262
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,350
negotiate with the other countries this

263
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,209
is why usually we talk about the French

264
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,209
German axis those two economies usually

265
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,160
all they lead the negotiations so

266
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,110
basically macron has a big incentive to

267
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,940
keep the power of the council as it is

268
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,980
now and Germany being the largest

269
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,470
country in both population and economics

270
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,810
it's pretty happy to so at the end of

271
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,240
the day macron and Merkel they sat down

272
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,540
together and they said hmm no spits and

273
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,610
Gandhi Darton we choose a German

274
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,199
Commission president and a French

275
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,940
president for the European Central Bank

276
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,160
hmm how about that and since Germany and

277
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,329
France have the most leverage on the

278
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,589
council the rest of the countries they

279
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,579
basically just said amen guys amen

280
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:49,860
you got yeah we have to this is where

281
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,089
Ursula von der Leyen

282
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,459
came into the picture basically she's

283
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,959
the perfect poster child for the

284
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,029
European she's German but she was born

285
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,040
and raised in Belgium she speaks five

286
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,949
languages and has friends everywhere

287
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:03,870
basically she's the kind of charismatic

288
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,519
person that everyone wants to hang out

289
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,560
with at a cocktail party so as soon as

290
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,910
they introduced her to the members of

291
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,190
the council the council accepted her no

292
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,230
surprise

293
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,310
and I know what you're gonna say you're

294
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,980
gonna say oh come on Simon I can't be it

295
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,810
you see when we tried to make political

296
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,700
analysis here at visual politic we often

297
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,010
try to use things like you know economic

298
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,470
data and surveys and complex strategies

299
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,240
to understand a politician's behavior

300
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,460
but we often forget the politics carried

301
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,520
out by humans like you and like me so

302
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,740
sometimes something as stupid as telling

303
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,300
the right joke to the right person at

304
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,940
the right cocktail party can drive big

305
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,160
political decisions in Europe this kind

306
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,950
of political maneuvering has a name it's

307
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,410
the brussels bubble so who did they

308
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,820
choose for the presidents of the

309
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,500
European Central Bank well in this case

310
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,730
it was a French woman Christine

311
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,220
Lagarde's the former IMF president this

312
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,950
is a great deal for macron he's killing

313
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,930
two birds with one stone but a French

314
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,220
person in power and he makes sure

315
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,160
Lagarde won't run against him smart move

316
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,950
Makran christine lagarde france's dream

317
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,230
president as the rest of the top jobs

318
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,120
went to spain italy and the liberals

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,950
let's be honest here the biggest winners

320
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,200
were germany and france david's early an

321
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,760
italian social democrat will become the

322
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,860
next EU parliament president Josip

323
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,570
borrow will become the vice president

324
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,430
and belgium liberal charles michelle

325
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,130
will lead the council so okay the big

326
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,920
question now is what's the next step how

327
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,960
does a celeb underline get to choose the

328
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,950
commissioners well let's have a look

329
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,050
[Music]

330
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,440
from the Lions team according to many

331
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,180
surveys the main reason why Britain's

332
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,830
voted in favor of brexit was not

333
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,260
regulations or immigration but a lack of

334
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,780
citizen control over you Affairs and

335
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,220
after everything we've said we must

336
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,110
admit that that is a bit of truth to

337
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,060
that and you could say oh no the

338
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,590
Parliament still could have rejected von

339
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,230
der Leyen as presidents well look at how

340
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,150
people can change their opinion on the

341
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,220
brussels bubble this is what the

342
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,080
People's Party spits kind of doubt and

343
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,390
Manfred weather said one day Weber urges

344
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,880
you lawmakers to push back against

345
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,820
decisions made in diplomatic backrooms

346
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,510
and look what he said just a month later

347
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,170
[Music]

348
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,420
Germany's Weber urges you lawmakers to

349
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,630
back von der Leyen in top job vote so it

350
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,460
doesn't seem to be a debate at least not

351
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,530
a transparent one that we can see in the

352
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,510
parliament it seems that most of the

353
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,940
decisions are made in a private room in

354
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,520
that Brussels bubble said oh you might

355
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
be wondering what what happens next what

356
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,820
can we expect from von der Leyen once

357
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,980
she gets into office the first thing you

358
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,990
have to do is name the commissioners so

359
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,670
we said before the commissioners are the

360
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,830
equivalent of a minister or a secretary

361
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,300
of state in the European Union there

362
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,130
must be 28 of them one for each member

363
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,590
country that means for example that you

364
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,080
couldn't have two Germans or two Italian

365
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,160
commissioners

366
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,660
but of course it's not the same thing

367
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,430
being the commissioner in charge of

368
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,650
Finance a very important spot as being

369
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,360
the one in charge of humanitarian aid I

370
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,890
mean who really gives a

371
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,380
now that nonsense am i right no I'm not

372
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,480
right it will be Vaughn's Ilan's job to

373
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,780
decide who does what so far all we know

374
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,460
is that the new governments of Europe

375
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,160
will have variety between genders there

376
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,690
will be as many female commissioners as

377
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,760
there are male commissioners and this is

378
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,920
where the EU parliament has the biggest

379
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,780
say because right after von der Leyen

380
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,850
names her commissioners they will have

381
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,430
to pass a test at Parliament and yes

382
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,740
those tests are not simple it's common

383
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,630
for some commissioners to not even pass

384
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:46,020
them for example in 2014 the slovenian

385
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,210
candidate failed at the parliaments

386
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,770
hearings and so they had to choose

387
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,020
another person from the same country so

388
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,690
yes von der Leyen will not have it that

389
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,270
easy in this regard one could see it as

390
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:02,200
a very effective check and balance

391
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,930
but now the question goes to you do you

392
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,639
think Makran did the right thing by

393
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,649
avoiding the spits on candidates and

394
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,720
system are the Euroskeptics right to

395
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,370
complain about the lack of democracy in

396
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,440
Europe well please leave your answer in
