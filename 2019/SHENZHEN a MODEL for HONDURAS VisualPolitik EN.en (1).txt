3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,769
here's a question for all of you what

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,349
brand is your mobile phone hello now I

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,549
guess many of you will probably answer

6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,570
Apple Samsung or highway Howie

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:24,600
away how do I know well no I'm not a

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,130
psychic or anything like that you

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,910
probably knew that

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,410
I know because year after year these

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,420
three companies have led sales in the

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,279
global phone market together they sell

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,809
approximately half of all smart phones

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,000
in the world although due to recent

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,440
events things could change a lot the

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,719
point is that we're talking about a huge

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,090
market here it's estimated that in 2018

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,680
the number of smartphone users reached

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,780
the staggering figure of three billion

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,969
people China tops the list of most users

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,120
worldwide almost 780 million Chinese use

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,829
a smartphone every day and not only that

23
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,109
China has also become a key player in

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,670
the industry for example it's the

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,530
country of origin of some of the largest

26
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,000
smartphone manufacturers in the world

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
we're talking about companies like

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,909
Huawei and ZTE so you know we're in

29
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,770
China these devices manufactured yep

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,810
it's in the city of Shenzhen better

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,990
known as China's Silicon Valley now

32
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,640
we've told you about this incredible

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,799
place in several previous videos we've

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,600
also told you how in just 40 years

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,640
Shenzhen has gone from being a small

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,740
fishing town to becoming a mega city

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,960
that specializes in advanced technology

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,700
it's one of the fastest-growing places

39
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,060
on the planet in case of um seen those

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,310
videos I will leave a link to several

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,770
related videos in the description

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:46,020
[Music]

43
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,179
and it isn't just Chinese companies like

44
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,340
hallway or ZTE even Apple and Samsung

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,229
work with a lot of suppliers in this

46
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,630
city

47
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,100
this means that practically all of us

48
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,380
are in one way or another dependent on

49
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,630
Shenzhen we use these cities products

50
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,920
constantly every day 24/7 in other words

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,600
we always have a little bit of Shenzhen

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,149
in our hands so how exactly did this

53
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,790
enormous transformation take place is it

54
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,890
a unique case in the world's and the

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,480
most important question of all what on

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,190
earth has Shenzhen got to do with

57
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,440
Honduras one of the poorest countries in

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,630
the Americas if not the world I'll

59
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:32,519
listen up the seed of change we told you

60
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,959
before here on visual politic at the

61
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,819
beginning of the 1980s the then Chinese

62
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,799
President Deng Xiaoping created a

63
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,930
special economic zone on the border with

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,890
Hong Kong in Shenzhen it was the first

65
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,810
of many areas that would later spread

66
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,000
throughout China now just a moment now

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,410
many of you might be thinking well what

68
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,490
exactly is a special economic zone

69
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,020
[Music]

70
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,120
well a special economic zone is

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,670
basically a defined geographical area

72
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,140
within a country where the rules for

73
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,270
doing business difference usually much

74
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,040
less restrictive than in the rest of the

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,970
country these zones were designed as a

76
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,340
way to boost trade and investments they

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,230
have clear geographical limits different

78
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,030
rules regulations into their own

79
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,160
administrative system in short we're

80
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,660
talking about territories designed to

81
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,220
target business production and

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,870
investments so in China's case these

83
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,060
places became capitalist havens within a

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,510
completely socialist model and you know

85
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,970
what they were a huge success the

86
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,380
opening of these economic zones

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,270
attracted a huge amount of investments

88
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,280
of both Chinese and foreign capital all

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,020
this investment attracted thousands of

90
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,820
immigrants and drove the construction of

91
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,860
factories and homes by the mid 1990s

92
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,900
Shenzhen already has 3 million

93
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,280
inhabitants and an extraordinarily

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,250
dynamic economy

95
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,050
the process continues to this day

96
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,760
Shenzhen currently has 12 million

97
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,100
residents which rises to 15 million

98
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,020
during the summer and fall season when

99
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,480
factories work exhaustively to meet the

100
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,010
demand for electronic gifts for

101
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,890
Christmas Santa Claus he cannot forget

102
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,900
all these smartphones drones and latest

103
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,000
generation gadgets that are sold during

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
the holiday season like there was no

105
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,190
tomorrow however China hasn't been the

106
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,730
only country to bet on this model

107
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,959
another example could be found in the

108
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,640
United Arab Emirates especially in the

109
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,530
emirate of Dubai if you're a fan of this

110
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,910
channel you would have heard us talking

111
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,370
about this in other videos for example

112
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,620
there's Jebel Ali or Dubai's financial

113
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,270
center the lacet not only has its own

114
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,800
regulations but it even has its own

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,840
courts it also includes reduced to

116
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,880
bureaucracy fewer taxes and a lot of

117
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,830
legal security and simple procedures to

118
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,750
do business so what more could he really

119
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,650
want while the fact is that the strategy

120
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,169
to diversify the UAE economy beyond oil

121
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,270
was based fundamentally on these special

122
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,980
economic zones of which there are

123
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,900
currently more than a 45 throughout the

124
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:58,669
country the results the Emirates have

125
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:00,830
had the highest economic growth in the

126
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,169
entire region since 1980 during this

127
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,330
time its GDP has multiplied by no less

128
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,520
than 10

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,020
now just a second does this mean that

130
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,909
the opening of special economic zones is

131
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,979
a recipe for success while sadly this

132
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,210
doesn't seem to be the case for a

133
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,919
special economic zone to really work it

134
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,810
needs to meet certain requirements it

135
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,370
needs to manage itself with complete

136
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,139
autonomy have good infrastructure that

137
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,060
needs to be a lot of legal security a

138
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,310
lot of economic freedom low taxes little

139
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,680
bureaucracy and enough lands to expand

140
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,300
so far we've seen two success stories

141
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,460
China and the UAE now can we find a case

142
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,470
where this strategy has failed and

143
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,479
certainly we can we just have to look to

144
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,880
India

145
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,180
[Music]

146
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,940
well certainly we can in a way India has

147
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,400
historically been an example not to

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,930
follow allow me to explain India

149
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,640
established its first special economic

150
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,520
zones back in the 1960s much earlier

151
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,140
than China in fact sit could be

152
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,030
considered a pioneer in the strategy

153
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,280
however in spite of its head start by

154
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,650
the year 2000 there were barely seven

155
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,300
zones operating throughout the country

156
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,700
with much much more modest results than

157
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,930
those of the Chinese example well these

158
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,430
areas they didn't manage to eliminate

159
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,810
bureaucracy they didn't work

160
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,850
autonomously they have limited space and

161
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,320
they operated with far too many

162
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,970
restrictions basically instead of

163
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,380
special economic zones they worked

164
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,600
shelled areas this is one of the reasons

165
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,280
that China has grown so much more than

166
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,180
India in recent decades

now hold on a second because if you made

171
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,340
it this far you're probably thinking

172
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,870
well Simon what on earth does all of

173
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,760
this have to do with Honduras when

174
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,620
you're gonna get to Honduras okay so

175
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,790
listen up

177

the Honduran experiment reality or

fiction

179
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,570
especially economic zones are very

180
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,160
popular in the world of international

181
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,500
trade since the 1980s they've sprouted

182
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,780
up like weeds in 1986 the International

183
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,510
Labour Organization reported 176 areas

184
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,150
in 47 countries and in 2006 there were

185
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,330
already more than 3,500 in 130 countries

186
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,190
currently in Latin America it is

187
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,440
estimated that there are more than 300

188
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,630
special economic zones more than half of

189
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,639
these are located in Central America of

190
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,020
course as you might imagine they have

191
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,880
much more restrictive conditions than in

192
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,919
China Latin governments they love to

193
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,080
control everything or at least they love

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,150
trying to however there is a country

195
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,800
that has put a plan on the table to

196
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,930
change the situation and their countries

197
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,180
on Duras Honduras is one of the poorest

198
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,040
countries in the entire region it's a

199
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,570
country where the vast majority of the

200
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,340
population live in poverty it also has

201
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,990
enormous rates of violence in every year

202
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,880
tens of thousands of people try to

203
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,710
escape the country in search of a better

204
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,190
life usually to the United States I have

205
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,620
to try new migrant Caravan leaves

206
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,460
Honduras and heads for the United States

207
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,830
violence and gangs obscure life in

208
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,710
Honduras well in recent years Honduras

209
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,380
has presented an ingenious plan to try

210
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,300
and change this situation a plan in

211
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,039
which the American economist Paul Romer

212
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,660
in 2018 has played a prominent role the

214
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,760
strategy consists of creating zones of

215
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,680
employment and economic developments

216
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,970
throughout the country now what exactly

217
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,090
are the seeds well along the same lines

218
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,530
that we talked about and given that

219
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,870
things don't work in Honduras seeds are

220
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,089
a kind of experiment aimed jump-starting

221
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,860
economic activity so it can grow it from

222
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,900
scratch in some areas of the country

223
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,400
that is leads will be areas in the

224
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,110
Honduran national territory that will

225
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,120
have special regulations and their own

226
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,250
institutions to guarantee security both

227
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,590
physical and legal and a lot more ease

228
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,330
of doing business as everything would

229
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,710
start from scratch it wouldn't be

230
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,080
necessary to change the entire national

231
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,120
system which seems impossible due to all

232
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,150
the existing interests the idea is that

233
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,740
these seeds will attract a lot of

234
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,840
investments and create many jobs so that

235
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,550
they can create a change in the rest of

236
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,320
the country this is what happens with

237
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,130
China's special economic zones the seeds

238
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,080
will have their own legal personality

239
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,240
will be administered autonomously and

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,740
are authorized to establish their own

241
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,870
policies and regulations and not only

242
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,280
that they will also have their own

243
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,290
police their own independent courts and

244
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,660
operate under the tradition of

245
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,700
anglo-saxon law known as common law

246
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,080
additionally these areas lands will be

247
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,580
the property of the state but it's

248
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,410
administration will be borne by the

249
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,420
seeds themselves which will define how

250
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,310
that land can be accessed or developed

251
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,540
all of this is in a competitive

252
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,040
framework so that companies and

253
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,660
investors can have the lands they need

254
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,130
for their projects without having to

255
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,959
face heavy urban regulations that could

256
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,890
slow development that way each special

257
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,180
zone can specialize in different

258
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,830
activities will be organized in

259
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,660
different ways to not only compete with

260
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,339
the rest of the world but also compete

261
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,089
with each other

262
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,140
something that would force its

263
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,209
administrators to copy and improve the

264
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,040
best existing policies to attract

265
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,600
investment attracts talents and

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,160
ultimately boost the country's

267
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,180
development so pretty smart right we can

268
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,890
imagine that financial centers logistic

269
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,870
centers special tourist areas and even

270
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,670
autonomous cities wait

271
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,230
autonomous cities yep you heard that

272
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,660
right why Limit these special zones to

273
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,250
any companies why not try to build

274
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,290
coexistence models that can work better

275
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,420
than the mess that currently exists in

276
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,370
Honduras these are known as free cities

277
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,450
something that we're going to be talking

278
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,130
about extensively here on visual

279
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,630
politics so please don't forget to

280
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,400
subscribe and click that Bell so you're

281
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,370
up to date with all our new videos but

282
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,930
hold on just a second before you start

283
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,700
ringing bells so this might sound like a

284
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,560
really really attractive project but

285
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,209
isn't it surprising that it's actually

286
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,130
the Honduran personal elite who are

287
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,690
leading this process I mean isn't that a

288
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,770
little bit suspicious

289
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,740
I'm Doren president's brother arrested

290
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,600
in Miami is charged with drug

291
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,220
trafficking well that's exactly what

292
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,589
Paul Romer himself thinks he decided to

293
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:03,510
distance himself from the project why

294
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,040
well that's because he thinks the

295
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,660
Honduran elite doesn't really want to

296
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,580
promote competition and investments they

297
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,230
want you have a territory that will only

298
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,560
benefit them they have passed a law that

299
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,410
crosses my bright red line it removes

300
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,240
all possibility of electoral

301
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,950
accountability for the people who run

302
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,990
the zone this is not in the law that I

303
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,420
supported I can't tell if what we are

304
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,970
watching is a farce or tragedy it could

305
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,130
end up as farce because I can't imagine

306
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,649
a thoughtful investor would go in and

307
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,779
invest under these circumstances in a

308
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,209
place controlled by a crony aristocracy

309
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,720
Paul Romer and he isn't the only doubter

310
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,790
this projects evolution has raised many

311
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,500
doubts the seeds could even end up

312
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,209
simply being an instrument so that the

313
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:47,459
oligarchs as always can take over more

314
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,230
sections of the country and stay with

315
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:49,920
them at will

316
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,630
the lack of transparency and the

317
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,730
country's social conflicts don't seem to

318
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,410
reflect the image of the government's

319
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,000
that seeks to promote developments

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,420
[Music]

321
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,910
that's why the initial buzz has been

322
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,160
replaced by disenchantment and suspicion

323
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
basically we're presented with a

324
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,240
fantastic idea and possibly a terrible

325
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,040
execution in any case the seeds are

326
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,110
projected to start at the end of 2019 if

327
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,760
they manage to consolidate them and move

328
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,410
forward respecting the spirit of freedom

329
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,880
competition and equality of

330
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
opportunities with which the special

331
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,510
economic zones were born we could be

332
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,610
facing a total change of course for

333
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,320
Honduras but at this point it's hard to

334
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,120
be optimistic about this ensure the

335
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
question is is on Duras really serious

336
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,510
about creating a model of fully

337
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,100
autonomous seeds without political

338
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,380
interference will Honduras become

339
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,360
Central America's chené chené whatever

340
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,770
the result will be watching on the

341
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,630
progress here a visual politic and I

342
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,070
