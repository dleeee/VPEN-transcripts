fact it looks like it belongs in JRR

Tolkien's middle-earth but if this were

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,920
the case it would definitely be Mordor a

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,330
place where things like this are

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,560

Guinea and I know what you're gonna say

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,800
I mean come on Simon one bad story

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,930
doesn't mean the whole island is bad and

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,879
yes well you're right about that it's

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:42,120
actually even worse Papua New Guinea

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,710

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,629
why are we talking to you about New

19
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,879
Guinea on visual politic what kind of

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,010
political issues can they have going on

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,260
well believe me there's a lot to talk

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,430
about here first of all New Guinea is

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,559
the third biggest island on the planet

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,019
that's after Australia and Greenland but

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,360
there is something more if you pay

26
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,770
attention to the map you can see the

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,500
island is divided into two halves by a

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,479
perfectly straight line this is the

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,430
border that separates Papua New Guinea a

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,860
sovereign state from Western Papua

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,590
region of Indonesia that is here in the

32
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,510
Indonesian part where a big separatist

33
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,340
movement has emerged so what would be a

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,590
state if Papua became independent from

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,259
Indonesia well right here you have one

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,030
very good reason

Freeport's goldmine in Papua largest in

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,290
the world exactly we're talking about

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,470
gold copper and yes soiling gas remember

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,720
when I compared Papua to Mordor

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,450
well Papua even has its own Mount Doom

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,610
where you can make gold rings and

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,660
various other things

45
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,869
this explains why Papua nationalism is a

46
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,479
headache for many so today's question is

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,670
what did pop ones really want from

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,440
Indonesia do they want to be their own

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,900
country or would they rather join their

50
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,119
Eastern neighbours and can they get the

51
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,920
sovereignty that they want today we're

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,850
going to answer all of these questions

53
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,270
but before we do let's take a look back

54
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:19,640
at the history of this island the island

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,070
nobody cared about over the years New

56
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,840
Guinea was controlled by the United

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,910
Kingdom Germany and the Netherlands and

58
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,130
I say controls because New Guinea was

59
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,470
considered so worthless that nobody was

60
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,180
interested in turning it into a proper

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,190
colony each of these European powers

62
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,380
just planted a flag created a harbor so

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,580
they could control the sea route

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,769
surrounding the islands and left it

65
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:42,570
alone but nobody really cared about what

66
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,640
was going on on the island itself so

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,410
most of the indigenous people over New

68
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,090
Guinea didn't even realize they'd been

69
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,820
conquered or colonized by anybody so of

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,040
course they kept their tribal system the

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
same as they'd had it before

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
this also explains why nobody tried to

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,079
take control of New Guinea during the

74
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,380
period of decolonization

75
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,150
basically during the 1960s and 70s all

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,860
the European powers I left the island

77
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,870
and divided it in two parts the line

78
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,510
that divides New Guinea is the 141st

79
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,850
Meridian from this line to the east is

80
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,770
Papua New Guinea an independent

81
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,750
sovereign country from this line to the

82
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,330
west we have an Indonesian province and

83
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,800
you might be wondering well what were

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,810
all of those tribes doing while this was

85
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,490
happening so as Lu said earlier many of

86
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,290
them had no idea about any of these

87
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,300
political maneuvers most of them didn't

88
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,250
even see European people in their day to

89
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,090
day lives

90
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,070
for example the Doni is one of the

91
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,200
biggest pop one ethnicities they've been

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,810
living in a bit of a stone-age existence

93
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,020
until 1938 when a plane flew over the

94
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,000
great Donnie Valley this is the first

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,310
contact that this tribe had with people

96
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,270
from outside the tribe this is far from

97
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,060
a tiny minority group Doni tribes are

98
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,340
estimated to have more than 200,000

99
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,770
people and they represent about 5% of

100
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,840
the Indonesian pop one population

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,510
technically they're Indonesian but many

102
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,580
of them are not even aware of this and

103
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,880
you might think that by now 2019 things

104
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,590
would have changed civilization and

105
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,540
internet connections everywhere right

106
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,720
well actually no just look at this news

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839

109
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,180
this remote tribe in New Guinea cuts

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,460
boys skin with razors so they look like

111
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,520
crocodiles and yes I said tribes in

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,620
plural because on this islands there are

113
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,050
more than 1,000 tribes and perhaps there

114
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,910
are many more that we don't even know

115
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,710
about and you might now be saying why

116
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,900
did Indonesia take the western part and

117
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,520
the answer is that Indonesia was

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,320
formerly a Dutch colony so that when

119
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,850
they got their independence they claims

120
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,560
this Dutch controlled territory too

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,540
since none of the tribes protested it

122
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,670
was given to the brand's new Indonesian

123
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,860
state and Indonesian quickly learns to

124
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,570
care about this worth of a silent

125
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,220
basically since the moments of heart a

126
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,020
the Indonesian dictator and father of

127
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,670
the nations set foot on the islands he

128
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,380
realized there was a lot more there than

129
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,540
just tribal people today one-third of

130
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,430
the gas that Indonesia exports is

131
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,740
produced in Papua and then we have the

Indonesia is not willing to let them go

144
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,849

direction yeah until recently the grass

berg mine was owned by a private company

148

killing and I know what you're thinking

189
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,990
I mean come on Simon there are lots of

190
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,060
dangerous cities in the world you sure

191
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,310
that Port Moresby is that exceptional

192
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,010
well actually yes look at what happens

193
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,630
during the APEC summit the APEC summit

194
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,280
is the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation

195
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,920
forum in 2018 they wanted to hold a

196
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,260
meeting here and well this is what

197
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:44,360
happens Papua New Guinea hosts APEC CEO

198
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,030
summit on cruise ship yep no matter how

199
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,770
many security companies and bodyguards

200
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,050
they hired politicians said they would

201
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,210
not set foot on lands there so the whole

202
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,380
event had to be held on a cruise ship

203
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,900
docked next to the coast extreme poverty

204
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,880
rates in Papua New Guinea are as high as

205
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,740
40 percent in comparison the rate in

206
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,470
neighboring Indonesia and Papua is 25

207
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,720
percent elsewhere in Indonesia drops to

208
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,850
about 6 percent of course we should take

209
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,410
all of these statistics with a pinch of

210
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,090
salt because as you can imagine there

211
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,950
are many areas on this island where

212
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,790
nobody can collect any reliable data

213
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,310
anyway Indonesian pop ones dude once

214
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,160
their gas oil and gold to be stolen by

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,960
Indonesians but they also don't want

216
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,640
them to be stolen by their Eastern

217
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,410
neighbors either basically they just

218
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,510
wanna for themselves Benny Wenda is a

219
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,700
separatist leader who lives in exile in

220
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,710
London his goal is to rule what he hopes

221
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,960
to name Western Papua but the question

222
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,000
is could this territory really become

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,800
independence you see the Western pop

224
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,840
world liberation movements led by Benny

225
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,940
Wenda has collected 1.8 million

226
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,160
signatures to request the United Nations

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,960
hold a referendum so now let's see what

228
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,700
could happen if they really go through

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,530
with this referendum how might it play

230
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,420
out well let's step back in time for a

231
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,110
moment

232
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,580
[Music]

233
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,470
Ferno consistent we said that nobody

234
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,540
really protested when Western Bob watt

235
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,910
fell into Indonesian hands well this

236
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,500
isn't exactly true as we told you

237
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,300
earlier Indonesia and Papua was

238
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,520
controlled by the Netherlands after

239
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,110
World War Two Indonesia became

240
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,180
independent and wanted to have papua as

241
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,710
part of their territory but the Dutch

242
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,170
said this made no sense think about it

243
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,850
there are more than 3,500 kilometers

244
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,340
between Jakarta and Papua they don't

245
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,470
have any economic historical or cultural

246
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,810
links so in order to solve this problem

247
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,910
they decided to hold a referendum the

248
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,920
problem well good luck trying to have

249
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,230
free fair and transparent elections in a

250
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,440
place with 1000 tribes the 1969

251
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,960
referendum also known erratically

252
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,320
perhaps as the free election act was

253
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,379
frankly a charade

254
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,329
theoretically 800,000 pop ones were

255
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,699
eligible to vote but only 1000 people

256
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:58,709
conveniently selected by the Indonesian

257
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,899
army ended up voting and they did it by

258
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,389
raising their hands what's more as

259
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:05,009
troops made sure that there was only one

260
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,720
option to choose from of course

261
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,009
throughout the results of the referendum

262
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,620
was a unanimous cried to become part of

263
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,089
Indonesia but I know you're thinking

264
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,889
back then Indonesia was under the

265
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,990
dictatorship of Sakana you can't expect

266
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,120
a dictator to organize free and fair

267
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,980
elections but now things are different

268
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,110
Indonesia is a democracy and that should

269
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,939
be true for Papua as well nevertheless

270
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,920
the problem is still the same how can

271
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,899
you organize elections in such a tribal

272
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,309
country here is where the knocking

273
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:34,240
system comes into the picture

274
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,540
knocking means in some Papua dialects

275
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,059
back basically the tribal chiefs go to

276
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:41,649
the electoral body with a bagful of

277
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,600
votes and they say this is what my

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,369
people vote it in some cases there isn't

279
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,410
even a bag the electoral body just go to

280
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,199
the tribal chief and ask directly so who

281
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,730
you go to vote for on the next elections

282
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,240
I don't know man like the dude in the

283
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,540
poster from one of the posters like the

284
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,559
green one dude

285
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,819
I asked jolly good dreams and how many

286
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:08,249
people do you have in your tribe people

287
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:13,959
300 like maybe 300 and some goats goats

288
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,899
people right mmm yes 300 people then

289
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,879
let's count the goats they're the right

290
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,179
ones yes good thank you sir thank you

291
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,999
for voting have a nice day as you can

292
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,439
imagine with such a well-organized

293
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,209
system it is no surprise that the

294
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,029
continent even president Joko Widodo won

295
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,279
a landslide victory in New Guinea by

296
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,829
having even more votes than voters don't

297
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,150
forget the goats

298
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,570
[Music]

299
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,250
pappan Electoral College finds more than

300
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,350
1 million people who voted twice in the

301
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,630
2019 elections now imagine what would

302
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,740
happen with this system on a

303
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,690
self-determination referendum it would

304
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,970
be easy for Papua an independent ists to

305
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,590
claim all the tribes voted for

306
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,510
self-determination also do not forget

307
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,790
that one third of the population

308
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,530
resident in Papua comes from Indonesia

309
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,870
and this is in fact the third of the

310
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,210
population that can easily be counted on

311
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,790
a census in other words the outcome of

312
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,680
this referendum would largely depend on

313
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,840
who gets to organise it now besides most

314
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,970
of the PAP ones wouldn't even care

315
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,950
perhaps they still don't even know that

316
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,780
they're considered Indonesians so this

317
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,460
is why we now hand the question over to

318
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,860
you can western papua get out of poverty

319
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,690
and become an independent state do you

320
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,580
think they can ever get past tribalism

321
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,710
or would it be better just to let them

322
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,390
be please leave your answer in the

323
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,220
