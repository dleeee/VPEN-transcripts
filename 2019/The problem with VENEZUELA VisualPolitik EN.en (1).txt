[Music]

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,110
there are a thousand ways to overthrow a

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,300
dictator from violent revolutions do

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,940
peaceful transitions but Venezuela is

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,010
trying something rather unique its

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,750
parliament has just named an alternative

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,180
president to Nicolas Maduro his name is

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,490
Juan Guido and he's the man who will

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,070
lead the country into democracy if he

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,940
can actually pull it off

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,699
[Music]

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,399
and let's be clear here Venezuela is now

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,010
under a dictatorship Nicolas Maduro is

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,719
dictatorship and I know you are you

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,800
thinking right now you might be thinking

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,479
well Simon how can it be a dictatorship

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,519
they totally have elections in Venezuela

19
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,010
and yes they do but people could also

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,680
vote in Bangladesh Egypt and Azerbaijan

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,570
even in North Korea they have

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,519
legislative elections every five years

23
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,229
and people could even choose among

24
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,879
different political parties I'm not

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,079
being sarcastic you can definitely

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,909
google that if you don't believe me but

27
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,379
look if you want to have democracy

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,080
elections they must be free and fair and

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
of course you need freedom of speech and

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,909
freedom of speech in Venezuela is as

31
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,400
scarce as toilet

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,250
[Music]

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,960
basically all the websites that a

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,940
critical of the government abandoned

35
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,680
that includes those using a link

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,050
shortener like bitly most of TV is

37
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,540
nationalized or owned by friends of the

38
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,580
governments and opposition newspapers

39
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,930
they can't be printed because the paper

40
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,120
industry is a monopoly that's held by

41
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,550
the government now yes you might still

42
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,890
say you know but dear he's very popular

43
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,570
among the people isn't he hasn't that

44
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,760
right well I mean of course he is in

45
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,890
fact every dictator in history was

46
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,810
beloved by his people you see one of the

47
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,430
first lessons in the dictators handbook

48
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,260
is never stop spending on propaganda and

49
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,300
another lesson is of course send all

50
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,190
your enemies to prison once you have the

51
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,600
courts in your pocket it's easy to

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,510
accuse anybody of any kind of crime in

53
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,729
Arabic dictatorships they usually claim

54
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,920
their opponents terrorists in medoras

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,830
Venezuela they just label them as

56
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,500
conspirators

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,970
and now you might be thinking well

58
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,530
shorts I mean we get it Madeira is a

59
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,750
dictator but proclaiming yourself as the

60
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,190
legitimate president without winning an

61
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,350
election isn't that kind of a coup and

62
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,630
this is what people kind of a saying

63
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,790
nowadays but the fact is the opposite is

64
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,190
kind of true a coup d'etat is defined as

65
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,350
the taking of a government through the

66
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,480
use of force by a group that has some

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,220
kind of power inside of the system

68
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,950
usually the military but Ron Guido is

69
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,360
using an article in the Venezuelan

70
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,480
Constitution instead article 233 allows

71
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,340
the president of the National Assembly

72
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,010
that is one widel to temporarily occupy

73
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,660
the presidency of the Republic in the

74
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,090
case of an absence of power since Maduro

75
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,680
got to power by violating the

76
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,450
constitution there is no president now

77
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,459
from a legal point of view so now the

78
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,830
new Venezuelan executive has 30 days to

79
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,650
call for elections so yes m'dear is

80
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,900
opposition is overthrowing a dictator by

81
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,880
following the constitution to the latter

82
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,800
and this is why so many governments

83
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,480
including Trump's America introduced

84
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,390
Canada have recognized mr. Guido as the

85
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,580
legitimate president of Venezuela but

86
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,350
there is still a big question that we

87
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,570
have to ask here is this good or bad

88
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,540
news for Venezuela is it that easy to

89
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,459
just end the dictatorship can you just

90
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,680
go claim the presidency and then wait

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,170
for America to recognize you and that's

92
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:24,610
it

93
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,300
[Music]

94
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,100
well to viewers you might expect of

95
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,130
course the answer is no if there's a

96
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,140
lesson we can learn from history on this

97
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,970
subject it's that even countries with

98
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,520
the worst dictatorships can get even

99
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,620
worse just look at Saddam Hussein's Iraq

100
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,240
or Gaddafi's Libya

101
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,010
so is Venezuela heading towards this

102
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,770
same fate or are the reasons to be more

103
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,990
optimistic about Venezuela's situation

104
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,790
well today we're actually not going to

105
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,170
answer these questions because it's

106
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,850
pretty impossible to do so but we are

107
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,770
going to give you the keys to

108
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,900
understanding them but before we do as

109
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,090
we always do let's take a look back at

110
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,160
the history

111
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,620
end of democracy remember this date may

112
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,510
the 1st 2017

113
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,370
in this moment Venezuela's Parliament

114
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,080
was mostly made up of members of

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,360
murderers opposition party of course

116
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,590
we're all just talking about a party

117
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,239
that opposed Maduro in fact there are

118
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,769
many of those and they range from

119
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,080
left-wing to right-wing but nobody

120
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,810
really cares about them since 2016 its

121
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,040
parliament has been declared

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
disrespectful this means they no longer

123
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,900
have any legal power why not well

124
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,400
because according to the government

125
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,870
there were three MPs that won an

126
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,530
election in an unfair manner

127
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,020
and big surprise here three MPs was the

128
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,700
exact number that they needed to avoid a

129
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,070
2/3 majority in Congress with the

130
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,720
two-thirds majority the executive power

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,240
would be in dire straits and this is why

132
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,180
nicolas maduro finally acted to cripple

133
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,630
the opposition do you know I'm summoning

134
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,730
the constituent power to achieve the

135
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,250
peace this republic needs we need to

136
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,740
destroy this fascist coup d'etat we need

137
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:14,860
the people with their sovereignty this

138
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,690
was the exact moment where Maduro

139
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,730
declared the parliaments illegal the

140
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,530
only opposition he still has was

141
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,140
politically killed and one of the next

142
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,000
well basically Maduro made a brand new

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,040
parliament the so called constituency

144
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,110
assembly this was a parliament with 500

145
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,140
of 40 MPs Webb surprise-surprise 503

146
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,760
were members of the government's party

147
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,680
strange as this sounds the movement

148
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
could still be considered legal

149
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,040
according to Venezuela's Constitution

150
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,740
Article 348 says that the president can

151
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,330
create a council to make a brand new

152
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,760
constitution the problem those MPs from

153
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,470
the same political party were making all

154
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,990
kinds of laws including tax laws it was

155
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,270
in fact just two parallel Parliament's

156
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,160
in the meantime the old Parliament's

157
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,599
with the different political parties

158
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,580
kept holding sessions that it didn't

159
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,319
really have any power the army and the

160
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,539
police they were on Medeiros side this

161
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,160
was when Venezuela went from kind of

162
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,680
being just this sketchy democracy closer

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
to financial collapse to a classic

164
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,789
dictatorship but hold on a minute

165
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,560
because there's another important part

166
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,330
here this fake Parliament called for

167
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,370
elections and as you can imagine with

168
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,110
nearly all of the members belonging to

169
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,819
the president's political party those

170
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,710
elections were as predictable as the

171
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,870
ending of The Passion of the Christ yes

172
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,919
you guessed it

173
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,530
Maduro he won by a landslide but of

174
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,900
course no serious country recognized the

175
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,000
results of these elections already in

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,979
2018 Mike Pence the American vice

177
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,020
president said this about Maduro

178
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,640
[Music]

179
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,990
United States has called this election

180
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,810
what it really was a sham Maduro must

181
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,270
hold free and fair elections release all

182
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,250
political prisoners immediately and

183
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,550
unconditionally Mike Pence

184
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,840
vice-president of the USA

185
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,730
the same happens in most South American

186
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,710
and European countries nobody recognized

187
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,420
the results of this election the problem

188
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,800
was they that there was no alternative

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,380
to maderos rule and this is how we got

190
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,230
to January of 2019 when Madeira took

191
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,940
office of course he didn't do it before

192
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,800
the National Assembly because he don't

193
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,870
like those guys instead he took office

194
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,700
in front of the Supreme Court of Justice

195
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,410
according to the Constitution this means

196
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,390
that he made his oath illegally and

197
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,760
therefore he is an illegal president

198
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,470
having no legitimate presidents the

199
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,360
president of the National Assembly Juan

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,480
Cueto made another oath and this is when

201
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,040
all of those countries who didn't

202
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,750
recognize the outcome of the elections

203
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,610
started recognizing grideau as the

204
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,830
legitimate president of Venezuela all

205
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,300
rights in any way you think he was it it

206
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,070
was just five minutes after grideau

207
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,720
became president the Trump basically

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,100
recognized him as the leader of

209
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,320
Venezuela he's is that just pure chance

210
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,880
or maybe there was a plan in place

211
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,710
already well let's take a look at that

212
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,240
here's about Venezuela if you've been

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,429
following visual politic for a while you

214
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:55,689
read you know the Venezuela is the

215
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,490
country with the biggest oil reserves on

216
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,139
the planet even bigger than Saudi

217
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,999
Arabia's Russia's or Americas the

218
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,259
problem though is that they can hardly

219
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,429
make a profit on them

220
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,439
you see it's one thing to have lots of

221
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,629
dinosaur juice and it's entirely another

222
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,999
to make money off that juice just have a

223
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:15,639
look at this very chart here you can see

224
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,189
the production cost of a barrel of oil

225
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,800
by country Saudi Arabia has the cheapest

226
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,689
per barrel production cost this is why

227
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,490
even at low market prices they always

228
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,439
make a profit on a per barrel basis

229
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,180
nonetheless Venezuela's on the other

230
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,949
side they have one of the most expensive

231
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,459
oils to produce and if that's not enough

232
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,649
pdvsa venezuelan state oil company is in

233
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,349
chaos

234
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,539
total production of oil in Venezuela has

235
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,060
dropped precipitously from 2.7 million

236
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,490
barrels per day to 1 million barrels per

237
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,440
day this is why despite being the

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,330
country with the biggest oil reserves on

239
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,930
the planet

240
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,900
Venezuela produces less oil than Angola

241
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,480
or Nigeria in fact they represent just

242
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,430
seven percent of the oil imports in

243
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,170
America this means their weight in the

244
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,480
International economy is pretty small

245
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,520
this is especially true at a time when

246
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,560
America is surpassing Saudi Arabia in

247
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,580
all production yep

248
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,680
America no longer that crazy about oil

249
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,000
on the other hand you've also got Trump

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,830
restricting investments in Venezuela

251
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,570
this means thanks aren't really exposed

252
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,880
to anything that happens in Venezuela so

253
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,850
you really don't care

254
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,380
and then of course the White House still

255
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,210
doesn't like Madero that's why they've

256
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,250
named Elliott Abrams as the special

257
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,230
envoy to Venezuela Abrams by the way was

258
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,550
one of the people behind the iran-contra

259
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,860
scandal as well as Venezuela's coup

260
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,470
against shadows in 2002 but let's be

261
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:35,920
honest

262
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,690
Trump has many things to think about

263
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,480
besides Venezuela in Spain and generally

264
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,400
the spanish-speaking world Venezuela is

265
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,650
on the front page of all the newspapers

266
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,660
everyone talks about it in the bars and

267
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,220
cafes of Madrid there is a debate going

268
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,410
on by those who support Madero and those

269
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,970
who don't but if you're in America you

270
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,200
might know that something has happened

271
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,580
in Venezuela that you're probably aren't

272
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,110
too passionate about it nonetheless

273
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,390
guess which country has a rather large

274
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,280
stake in Venezuela and I'm probably

275
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,020
gonna give it away when I say that it

276
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,250
begins with AC it's not Colombia

277
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,610
[Music]

278
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,910
China now taking 28% of Venezuela's oil

279
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,340
production to repay them as we said in

280
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,500
previous videos China needs natural

281
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,630
resources so they made big loans to

282
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,029
Venezuela so far Caracas owes Beijing

283
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,520
more than 50 billion dollars that's the

284
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,680
cost of three Olympic Games but since

285
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,810
Venezuela no longer has the money to pay

286
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,029
their debts they have to pay China with

287
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,770
oil and if you still wondering why China

288
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,870
still supports Madero well he's the only

289
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,700
one who can guarantee the oil shipments

290
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,160
add to this drug trafficking according

291
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
to several DEA reports between 15 and 20

292
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,360
percent of the cocaine trade goes

293
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,290
through Venezuelan soil important

294
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,960
figures such as Diosdado Cabello would

295
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,390
be directly involved in narco activities

296
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,730
Venezuela is a sort of narco state in

297
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,290
the sense that it's a place where

298
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,330
traffickers can establish their

299
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,190
logistics hubs with the help of

300
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,529
government officials all right so all of

301
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,720
this is fine but the big question is can

302
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,460
there really be a peaceful democratic

303
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,040
transition in Venezuela well let's

304
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,730
explore that

305
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,310
what can be done about this as we said

306
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,050
before Venezuelan opposition is

307
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,240
completely fragmented they have lots of

308
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,070
political parties conservatives liberals

309
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,200
socialists but unlike other countries

310
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,060
like Poland or the Czech Republic where

311
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,190
they had strong leaders that opposed the

312
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,750
dictators there is no clear opposition

313
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,740
to Maduro

314
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,050
but well now things have changed with

315
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,850
international support one Guido can

316
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,860
really galvanize the Democratic

317
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,690
opposition of course he's just the

318
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,490
interim president and this means that in

319
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,990
30 days you will have to call for

320
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,900
elections but this is kind of where the

321
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,930
good news actually ends

322
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,010
[Music]

323
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,410
you see laws they're just empty words if

324
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,030
there's nobody to enforce them this is

325
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,770
why the military and the police are so

326
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,300
important here in other words Guerra

327
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,950
might have all the legitimacy he ever

328
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,630
good ones but how can he call for

329
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,400
elections if the army doesn't want this

330
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,090
to happen

331
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,850
this explains why both Grider and Maduro

332
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,110
have been trying to seduce the army

333
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,490
[Music]

334
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,170
Nicolas Maduro demanded loyalty to the

335
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:12,680
army

336
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,870
we must enforce the power of the

337
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,120
Venezuelan nation with the military so

338
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,010
far the Army is on the dura side at

339
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,480
least at the time we're recording this

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,760
video just the quick parentheses here at

341
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,770
the moment we are editing this video

342
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,290
this is February the second general of

343
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,570
the Venezuelan army has just bloated a

344
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,210
youtube video claiming that he supports

345
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,400
one way though and he rejects the

346
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,070
authority of Nicolas Maduro the name of

347
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,920
this army official is Francisco Steven

348
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,230
genius Rodriguez and you can find the

349
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,910
link to his video on the description

350
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,100
below most high ranking officials are

351
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,470
completely loyal to his rule and in the

352
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,570
past few years Caracas has been raising

353
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,310
the salaries of the soldiers today the

354
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,260
average Venezuelan soldier can make more

355
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,660
money than a surgeon but still it's not

356
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,460
that much money in fact we're talking

357
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,230
about the equivalent of about $80 a

358
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,300
month in other words soldiers are still

359
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,490
poor just like the rest of the country

360
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,200
so is this enough to make the army a

361
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,420
rise up against Maduro well we don't

362
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,250
know but it is something to take into

363
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,320
account and what about all of those

364
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,540
high-ranking officials well that's a

365
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,320
whole other story

366
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,930
in fact they live really a lot better

367
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,120
don't believe me well let's take a trip

368
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,000
through the Salamanca Quarter

369
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,500
Salamanca is the Spanish Manhattan it's

370
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,240
a luxury neighborhood in the center of

371
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,720
Madrid

372
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,730
everybody here is well-off and as a

373
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,700
sidenote they vote conservative in 2010

374
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,590
only some Venezuelan officials live tip

375
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,450
some of them even made investments but

376
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,310
in recent years more and more Madeira

377
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,350
officials have been arriving in fact

378
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,970
some people are starting to call the

379
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:50,150
area little Venezuela many times I'm in

380
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,430
a restaurant here in Madrid and next to

381
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,990
me there are people I would be scared to

382
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,290
see in Caracas said Leopoldo Lopez he'll

383
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,110
father of Leopoldo Lopez a Venezuelan

384
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,730
political prisoner for example the

385
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,620
personal nurse of Hugo Chavez brought

386
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,720
property for 1.8 million euros here in

387
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,960
2015 of course she did it in cash and

388
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,670
just like her other people have come

389
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,560
with briefcases full of money ready to

390
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,630
buy luxury properties even the daughter

391
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,400
of the Minister of Defence lives in

392
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,750
Madrid in other words murderers

393
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,640
officials are sending money to Venezuela

394
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,740
in order to prepare for potential exile

395
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,200
some go to Madrid of this go to Miami

396
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,420
few good Bogota and here's a good way to

397
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,490
put some pressure on the army economic

398
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,080
sanctions on government officials would

399
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,970
restrict them from making these kinds of

400
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,130
investments this is nothing new though

401
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,930
in fact this is the same policy the

402
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,640
international community has with North

403
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,470
Korea these kind of measures they put a

404
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,210
lot of pressure on the military so that

405
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,070
they'll start thinking about turning to

406
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,050
the democratic side but all right what

407
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,060
if the army still is supporting the

408
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,830
dictatorship I mean what would happens

409
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,260
then can a dictatorship survive even if

410
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,910
America doesn't recognize it and the

411
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,950
answer is yeah

412
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,500
for example Mao Zedong's China was not

413
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,360
recognized by Washington for years the

414
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,440
White House considered Taiwan's

415
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
government to be the legitimate

416
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,350
government of China and something

417
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,269
similar could indeed happen in Venezuela

418
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,490
another possibility is an open civil war

419
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,230
the army could fight grideau who would

420
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,510
ask for international help in fact there

421
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,430
are rumors that America might be sending

422
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,079
some troops to Colombia or so we've

423
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,910
found news that claims that some

424
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,350
mercenaries have been crossing the

425
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,449
border from Brazil fake news or not we

426
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,610
can't be sure but it would kind of make

427
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,140
sense

428
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,410
[Music]

429
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,629
nonetheless and this is just our opinion

430
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:34,309
but it's hard to believe that America or

431
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,499
Europe would risk so much for Venezuela

432
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,839
and Maduro himself he doesn't want to

433
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,730
war civil wars can have unintended

434
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,249
consequences for dictators especially

435
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:44,509
when they want to leave their

436
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,249
presidential palace overnight and a

437
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,079
group of opposes captures up with them

438
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,399
weak just look what happened with

439
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,160
Mussolini or Ceausescu or Gaddafi but

440
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,980
this is like I say it's just our opinion

441
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,910
and now it's your turn

442
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,470
what do you think will happen in

443
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,389
Venezuela is it time for this country to

444
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,699
recover its democracy or will Maduro

445
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,619
remain in power for many years to come

446
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:05,179
