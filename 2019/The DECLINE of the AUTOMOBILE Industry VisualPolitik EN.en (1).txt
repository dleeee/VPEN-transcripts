took a course on how to go viral which

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,510
IO is pretty damn skeptical about but

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,580

into R&D it may be hard to believe but

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,500
companies like Volkswagen Daimler or

55
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,209
Toyota invest in research and

because the automotive industry isn't

the last two years many questions have

73
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,470
arisen so many that recently it has led

74
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,990
to this main question are we seeing the

75
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,240
decline of the automobile industry as we

76
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,810
know it today

of megacities where cars would

88
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:30,880
supposedly become obsolete at least

89
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,130
private cars all this is fueling the

90
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,260
peak car concept according to which the

91
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,209
automotive industry would be on the

92
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,220
verge of reaching its historical sales

93
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,650
maximum if it hasn't already reached it

94
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,540
this means that from now on or at least

95
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,890
shortly we're going to be seeing fewer

96
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,290
cars being sold each year not more cars

97
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,060
fewer cars

99
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,150
when you put all these trends together

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,459
you're going to see a cap on personal

101
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:05,920
vehicle ownership start to emerge we are

104
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,660
as if this weren't enough government

105
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,610
sends the growing social conscience

106
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,410
they're exerting increasing pressure so

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,030
that manufacturers produce more

108
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,280
environmentally friendly cars and this

109
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,530
is all very good but it does present a

110
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,540
slight inconvenience for producers

111
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,520
developing an entire technology and

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,830
adapting all processes to it it costs a

113
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,700
fortune

114
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,889

years

121
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,320
but we could of course think well sure I

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,060
mean so what in the end are still going

123
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,710
to be rich from car sales and that's

124
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,480
precisely where the pique car concept

125
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,120
comes into play allow me to explain

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,030
if costs grow as a result of the new

127
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,560
technologies that cants have to

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,510
incorporate since all of the investments

129
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,980
that companies have to make for example

130
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,710
in R&D or adapt their production methods

131
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,050
for and then sales drop whatever soon

132
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,790
lead to the collapse of these companies

133
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,830
profits it essentially leads to higher

134
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,870
costs and lower income not to mention

135
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,880
the risks that some will fail in the

136
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
transition and get kicked out of the

137
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,300
market in other words we could say folks

138
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,180
that car manufacturers are facing a kind

139
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,200
of perfect storm a reflection of what

140
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,850
all these concerns involved can be found

141
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,770
in the automobile companies stocks that

142
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,810
is in the price of their shares in

143
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,570
general these companies are quoted at a

144
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,030
price earnings per share ratio that is

145
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,380
much lower than the market average of

146
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,120
course given these circumstances many

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,010
professional investors won't hesitate to

148
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,170
consider them as value traps they look

149
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,150
like cheap stocks yes but as their

150
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,860
margins and profits are going to drop

151
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,940
well they really aren't now at this

152
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,230
point before continuing there's a

153
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,300
question we need to ask ourselves why or

154
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,820
how is the peak car concept reached well

155
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,669
listen up

156
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,680
an industry in decline

157
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,410
friends the peek car concept rose from

158
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,110
an idea technological changes trends and

159
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,060
the world's increasing urbanization are

160
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,740
going to lead to fewer car sales

161
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,270
see on one hand our planet is

162
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,979
increasingly becoming a world of cities

163
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,380
especially mega cities the percentage of

164
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,639
the world's population lives in cities

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,729
won't stop growing in 2050 70% of the

166
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,650
entire world population is expected to

167
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,509
live in urban areas and logically in

168
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,639
these spaces a car can sometimes be more

169
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,500
of a nuisance than a solution for

170
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,120
example traffic pollution many large

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,889
cities have begun to restrict the use of

172
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,070
vehicles in urban centers

173
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,980
[Music]

174
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,650
for example in Shanghai Shenzhen or

175
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,540
Beijing license plates for cars with

176
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,940
combustion engines are auctioned that is

177
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,590
there's an annual limit of new

178
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,390
enrollments since if you want to get one

179
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,610
you have to really dig deep into your

180
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,930
pocket if you can and if it's worth it

181
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,250
[Music]

182
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,930
then this process is reinforced even

183
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,670
more doing to the growing environments

184
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,710
or concerns that exist in society that

185
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,690
have led to new car sharing formulas and

186
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,760
an extension of services such as uber or

187
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,080
lyft that way following the reasoning of

188
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,730
the pique car defenders if the average

189
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,490
time of use of the vehicles grows fewer

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,320
vehicles will be needed and if hiring a

191
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,090
car can be done comfortably at any time

192
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,920
with your mobile phone well you wouldn't

193
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,090
be as motivated to Bonnie won why spend

194
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,920
money on a car that will spend most of

195
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,960
its time in a garage and that's not even

196
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,250
getting into talking about when

197
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,170
autonomous cars arrive the results but

198
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,730
among other things there will be fewer

199
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:01,400
car sales and not only that meanwhile as

200
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
the costs for motor companies increase

201
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,030
and predictably so does the competition

202
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,370
for example from China these firms are

203
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,020
also facing threats from Harmony's like

204
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,460
Google or Microsoft tube might be

205
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,930
delving into the business for the

206
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,790
prospects of the industry's Giants

207
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,710
currently these aren't exactly good

208
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,510
things folks these are the reasons why

209
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,520
the big car companies are not in style

210
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,170
however let's pause for a moment before

211
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,330
condemning the entire industry let's ask

212
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,920
ourselves a question what if things

213
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,930
weren't so bad can we find some signs

214
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,310
that suggest that the golden years of

215
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,110
the powerful automobile industry have

216
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,380
not ended yet well folks yes we can so

217
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,780
listen up

218
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,100
what is to come

219
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,380
China moved from the bicycle to the car

220
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,370
in just 20 years

221
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,200
in 1994 the typical images of the

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,820
country included streets crowded with

223
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,460
bicycles give you an idea in 1985 there

224
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,440
were fewer cars throughout China than in

225
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,660
London and to top it all almost all of

226
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,220
those cars were from the government's

227
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,600
less than three percent of the country's

228
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,390
passenger cars were privately owned

229
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,360
however from 1994 everything changed in

230
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,880
just 15 years China surpassed even the

231
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,590
United States as the world's largest

232
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,500
automobile market and you know many cars

233
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,330
are currently sold in China each year no

234
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,240
less than 28 million 11 million more

235
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
than in the United States to give you an

236
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,620
idea of what this entails General Motors

237
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,720
itself one of the great icons of the

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,400
American industry today sells more cars

239
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,350
in China than it does in the United

240
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,400
States

241
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,340
the evolution folks was spectacular and

242
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,170
there was a reason this is the enormous

243
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,790
growth of the Chinese middle class of

244
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,260
which we've already talked about here on

245
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,210
visual politic however despite all of

246
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,610
this growth the rate of cars in China is

247
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,260
still very low is less than five times

248
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,840
that of the United States

249
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,910
in other words there's still a lot of

250
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,590
room to grow but okay so you might be

251
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,690
thinking but I mean Simon now with the

252
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,610
changes we've seen that Chinese won't

253
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,250
need as many cars right and also in many

254
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,110
of its cities that kind of just annoying

255
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,800
well the answer there is yes and also no

256
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
we tend to forget it but the Chinese

257
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
middle class and the families purchasing

258
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,380
power continues to grow very strongly

259
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,150
and even though the percentage may be

260
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,400
somewhat lower than in the past families

261
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,560
still want to have their own car and if

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,790
they have the money they might even get

263
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,820
an Aldi a BMW or Mercedes folks it'll be

264
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,500
a good idea to take a look at Japan's

265
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:37,100
experience here see Japan has one of the

266
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,330
largest urban populations on the planet

267
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,210
my 4% of Japanese live in urban areas

268
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,160
and the country also has the world's

269
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,350
most populated city Tokyo with 38

270
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,550
million people living in its

271
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,910
metropolitan area well despite this the

272
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,620
aging population and having public

273
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,360
transport systems that are among the

274
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,310
best in the world the rate of vehicles

275
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,710
per capita is not only four times higher

276
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,140
than in China but new car sales remains

277
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,570
stable

278
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:09,980
[Music]

279
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,330
in other words if we talk about

280
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,790
probabilities I think we can expect the

281
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,160
Chinese market to continue to rise for

282
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,840
quite some time but the good news it

283
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,780
doesn't end here in the United States

284
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,640
sales are at record levels even if a

285
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,290
vehicle's average age has risen to a

286
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,450
stunning and record-breaking number of

287
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,550
12 years that said if we consider that

288
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,560
the US economy has full employment wages

289
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,090
growing in the way of life hasn't

290
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,680
changed and cities haven't changed it

291
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,600
doesn't seem probable that sales will

292
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,950
fall permanently wouldn't you think

293
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,210
because together China and the United

294
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,250
States with nearly 50 million cars sold

295
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,230
each year account for more than 50

296
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,410
percent of worldwide sales right now

297
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,930
everyone still hopes to sell more cars I

298
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,820
haven't come across a single company

299
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,610
that forecasts a decline Philip Capshaw

300
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,680
a McKinsey partner who specializes in

301
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,509
transportation

302
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,979
but that's not all the big manufacturers

303
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:06,259
could still receive some great news and

304
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,819
that's India India's a country with more

305
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,309
than 1.3 billion inhabitants that even

306
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,779
though it's lagged behind in China is

307
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:13,459
now beginning to wake up

308
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,739
the Indian government is building more

309
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,229
than 20,000 kilometers of new roads in

310
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,029
the country where the vehicle ownership

311
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,609
rate is very low

312
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,899
little by little that is beginning to

313
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,359
change in 2018 vehicle sales in India

314
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,939
grew by almost 9% 3.27

315
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,889
million vehicles overtaking the United

316
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,569
Kingdom as the fifth largest market in

317
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,609
the world by the way the company that

318
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,289
sells the most cars in India is actually

319
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,809
Japanese Suzuki controls almost 50

320
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,360
percent of the Indian market

321
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,009
[Music]

322
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,839
however folks that's nothing just to

323
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,029
reach China's vehicle rate India would

324
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,889
have to sell more than a hundred million

325
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:54,050
cars and the strange thing wouldn't be

326
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,240
to think that it will happen but that it

327
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,190
won't do to status freedom or comfort

328
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,560
families when they can afford it want to

329
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,990
have their own car just 20 years ago we

330
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,279
would have ever thought that China would

331
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,379
sell more than 28 million cars a year of

332
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,180
course behind India there's also Vietnam

333
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,670
Indonesia and many African countries so

334
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,410
when people say that fewer cars will be

335
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,360
sold I don't really necessarily think

336
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,750
that that's gonna be the case and

337
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,399
regarding car pooling services at the

338
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,170
moment the data tells us that what they

339
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,699
do is increase the number of kilometers

340
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:25,220
travels not decrease them that is they

341
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,290
make people use cars more as a means of

342
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,100
transportation

343
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,139
yes service cars or those from different

344
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:32,600
car sharing platforms move more time but

345
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,519
they also cover more kilometers so if

346
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,259
their average life is lower than that of

347
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,579
private vehicles in addition car

348
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:42,889
companies themselves have dealt strongly

349
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,839
into the car sharing market in cities

350
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,910
they see a potentially huge business and

351
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,939
a new source of income Daimler and BMW

352
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,759
plan 1.1 billion dollar uber bottle

353
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,069
Daimler and BMW are pouring more than 1

354
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,050
billion euros into their joint car

355
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,180
sharing and ride-hailing businesses to

356
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,279
take on the likes of uber and lyft the

357
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,870
German venture is estimated to become

358
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,209
the world's largest car sharing operator

359
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,829
but all right at this point you might

360
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,329
have some concerns you might be thinking

361
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:10,310
well what happens to the environment is

362
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,620
this all really that sustainable well

363
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,269
sorry but the question shouldn't be

364
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,100
whether it's sustainable or not this

365
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,480
rather how we're going to achieve

366
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,250
sustainability either with more

367
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,439
efficient engines electric vehicles or

368
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,180
maybe even hydrogen cars for example

369
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,189
along this line in just five or six

370
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,750
years the Chinese government wants more

371
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,430
than six million electric cars to be

372
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,259
sold in the country each year cast that
