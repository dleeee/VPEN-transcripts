3
00:00:07.37 --> 00:00:11.190
located in the Persian Gulf Qatar is a

4
00:00:09.51 --> 00:00:13.230
country with an area of a little more

5
00:00:11.19 --> 00:00:15.150
than ten thousand square kilometers just

6
00:00:13.23 --> 00:00:15.540
to give you some idea of just how small

7
00:00:15.15 --> 00:00:17.900
that is

8
00:00:15.54 --> 00:00:20.460
it's nearly 40 times smaller than

9
00:00:17.9 --> 00:00:23.220
California so when this country got its

10
00:00:20.46 --> 00:00:26.640
independence from the UK in 1971 Qatar

11
00:00:23.22 --> 00:00:28.740
was a far away hostile and very very

12
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:30.660
poor place as a matter of fact it was

13
00:00:28.74 --> 00:00:33.239
one of the poorest territories of the

14
00:00:30.66 --> 00:00:35.160
United Kingdom and well that kind of

15
00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.870
made a lot of sense the Qatar Peninsula

16
00:00:35.16 --> 00:00:39.239
is a place where temperatures can reach

17
00:00:36.87 --> 00:00:41.010
50 degrees Celsius in summer it's almost

18
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.660
completely covered by desert and it was

19
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:45.420
certainly one of the most uninhabitable

20
00:00:42.66 --> 00:00:47.760
places on earth but it didn't stay that

21
00:00:45.42 --> 00:00:50.100
way forever and today Qatar is the

22
00:00:47.76 --> 00:00:51.960
richest country on the planet that's

23
00:00:50.1 --> 00:00:56.120
right the citizens of this tiny nation

24
00:00:51.96 --> 00:00:58.770
enjoy a per capita income of more than

25
00:00:56.12 --> 00:01:00.690
125,000 dollars which is almost three

26
00:00:58.77 --> 00:01:02.360
times the income in France and five

27
00:01:00.69 --> 00:01:05.520
times that found in Chile

28
00:01:02.36 --> 00:01:05.520
[Music]

29
00:01:08.0 --> 00:01:13.110
this is a country which was almost

30
00:01:10.62 --> 00:01:14.909
uninhabited a country that could hardly

31
00:01:13.11 --> 00:01:16.830
survive on its fishing industry and

32
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.509
today it looks something like Scrooge

33
00:01:16.83 --> 00:01:26.280
McDuck safe people things need the

34
00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.810
government of Qatar has investments and

35
00:01:26.28 --> 00:01:29.640
properties all around the world it is

36
00:01:27.81 --> 00:01:32.040
the birthplace of Al Jazeera the most

37
00:01:29.64 --> 00:01:34.440
important Arabic media company and well

38
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:37.290
then there is Doha the capital which is

39
00:01:34.44 --> 00:01:40.680
a sea of skyscrapers malls and luxurious

40
00:01:37.29 --> 00:01:42.390
cars a mix of Monaco and Vegas but

41
00:01:40.68 --> 00:01:44.130
without the alcohol and gambling there's

42
00:01:42.39 --> 00:01:46.649
no room for simplicity everything is

43
00:01:44.13 --> 00:01:48.869
sumptuous huge and sparkling in Doha on

44
00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.090
how sauce tava conflict areas reporter

45
00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.740
Qatar has gone from being a dark shelter

46
00:01:51.09 --> 00:01:55.410
for what harvest preaches and has become

47
00:01:52.74 --> 00:01:57.360
what people might consider the most open

48
00:01:55.41 --> 00:01:59.369
country in the Middle East this is of

49
00:01:57.36 --> 00:02:01.110
course excluding Dubai but as you might

50
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.720
know Dubai is an emirate and not

51
00:02:01.11 --> 00:02:08.670
actually a country in modern-day Doha we

52
00:02:06.72 --> 00:02:11.549
can find international universities or

53
00:02:08.67 --> 00:02:13.530
the so-called church city a complex of

54
00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.570
Protestant Orthodox and Catholic

55
00:02:13.53 --> 00:02:17.610
churches like the Church of Our Lady

56
00:02:15.57 --> 00:02:19.770
rosary

57
00:02:17.61 --> 00:02:22.860
20 million dollar Catholic Church which

58
00:02:19.77 --> 00:02:25.230
seats 2700 is located in the southern

59
00:02:22.86 --> 00:02:28.320
outskirts of the city on land donated by

60
00:02:25.23 --> 00:02:30.420
Sikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-thani Katara's

61
00:02:28.32 --> 00:02:32.460
Amir so now the question of course has

62
00:02:30.42 --> 00:02:34.920
to be how did Qatar achieve this

63
00:02:32.46 --> 00:02:40.080
remarkable transformation well let's

64
00:02:34.92 --> 00:02:43.620
take a look about the lmg blessing

65
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:45.390
liquefied natural gas in other videos

66
00:02:43.62 --> 00:02:47.310
we've discussed the keys as to why some

67
00:02:45.39 --> 00:02:49.380
countries are so rich but in Qatar's

68
00:02:47.31 --> 00:02:53.040
case it is much simpler and it can be

69
00:02:49.38 --> 00:02:56.190
summarized by two things oil and more

70
00:02:53.04 --> 00:02:58.950
importantly natural gas may massive

71
00:02:56.19 --> 00:03:01.110
massive amounts of natural gas yep that

72
00:02:58.95 --> 00:03:02.610
really is pretty much it if you're

73
00:03:01.11 --> 00:03:04.230
disappointed well just hold on a second

74
00:03:02.61 --> 00:03:07.860
because it's actually quite an

75
00:03:04.23 --> 00:03:09.720
interesting story the first oil fields

76
00:03:07.86 --> 00:03:12.120
they were found in the 1940s by the

77
00:03:09.72 --> 00:03:14.459
1960s exploitation was already

78
00:03:12.12 --> 00:03:17.280
consolidated and things in the poor

79
00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.260
country of Qatar changed but not really

80
00:03:17.28 --> 00:03:21.420
that much the thing is that it wasn't

81
00:03:19.26 --> 00:03:23.880
until the beginning of the 1970s that

82
00:03:21.42 --> 00:03:25.860
shale found the biggest treasure of this

83
00:03:23.88 --> 00:03:28.530
country and that would be the North

84
00:03:25.86 --> 00:03:35.130
fields which is the largest gas field in

85
00:03:28.53 --> 00:03:37.260
the world but at that time well natural

86
00:03:35.13 --> 00:03:38.640
gas it just wasn't that profitable you

87
00:03:37.26 --> 00:03:40.950
see at the time gas could only be

88
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:43.200
transported through gas pipes and Qatar

89
00:03:40.95 --> 00:03:44.880
was far from places where this gas could

90
00:03:43.2 --> 00:03:47.250
be used even shale

91
00:03:44.88 --> 00:03:49.830
well they soon forgot about it but well

92
00:03:47.25 --> 00:03:52.200
things they were really about to change

93
00:03:49.83 --> 00:03:55.860
in 1996 the old Emir Hamad bin Khalifa

94
00:03:52.2 --> 00:03:57.570
al-thani who abdicated in 2013 staged a

95
00:03:55.86 --> 00:03:59.790
coup d'etat while his father was in

96
00:03:57.57 --> 00:04:01.920
Switzerland this Emir reached power with

97
00:03:59.79 --> 00:04:04.680
a clear idea and that was that the

98
00:04:01.92 --> 00:04:07.140
future of Qatar was in gas they simply

99
00:04:04.68 --> 00:04:09.150
had to exploit their huge gas fields man

100
00:04:07.14 --> 00:04:10.560
so well he did just that the new and

101
00:04:09.15 --> 00:04:12.720
they're decided to invest in an

102
00:04:10.56 --> 00:04:14.910
undeveloped and rare technology this

103
00:04:12.72 --> 00:04:16.739
technology it's liquefaction which is

104
00:04:14.91 --> 00:04:18.120
the ability to carry natural gas in its

105
00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.640
liquid form so that it could be

106
00:04:18.12 --> 00:04:22.650
transported in large ships as if it was

107
00:04:20.64 --> 00:04:24.000
oil in order to do this the gas needed

108
00:04:22.65 --> 00:04:26.940
to cool down and be kept at a

109
00:04:24.0 --> 00:04:29.280
temperature of minus 161 degrees Celsius

110
00:04:26.94 --> 00:04:30.580
which is minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit

111
00:04:29.28 --> 00:04:34.650
now this is some

112
00:04:30.58 --> 00:04:34.650
that is pretty inconvenient to do

113
00:04:36.72 --> 00:04:40.680
so while Qatar they decided to invest

114
00:04:38.88 --> 00:04:42.390
enormous quantities of resources in

115
00:04:40.68 --> 00:04:44.370
order to boost the development of this

116
00:04:42.39 --> 00:04:46.620
technology so that it could be used on a

117
00:04:44.37 --> 00:04:48.450
massive scale because of that investment

118
00:04:46.62 --> 00:04:50.670
Qatar is now the world's largest

119
00:04:48.45 --> 00:04:52.980
exporter of LNG with this technology

120
00:04:50.67 --> 00:04:54.750
Qatar is able to export its enormous gas

121
00:04:52.98 --> 00:04:56.640
supplies to the rest of the world in

122
00:04:54.75 --> 00:04:58.650
fact last year three-quarters of Qatar's

123
00:04:56.64 --> 00:05:01.020
gas went to Asian countries like China

124
00:04:58.65 --> 00:05:02.430
India South Korea and Japan and well

125
00:05:01.02 --> 00:05:04.350
there's more because the industrial

126
00:05:02.43 --> 00:05:06.840
complex the qatar has developed is so

127
00:05:04.35 --> 00:05:09.030
big so large-scale that the country has

128
00:05:06.84 --> 00:05:11.190
managed to have the cheapest costs of

129
00:05:09.03 --> 00:05:12.480
extraction and liquefaction in the

130
00:05:11.19 --> 00:05:14.370
entire world

131
00:05:12.48 --> 00:05:17.040
to illustrate this a methane tanker of

132
00:05:14.37 --> 00:05:20.910
LNG is four times cheaper in Qatar than

133
00:05:17.04 --> 00:05:22.680
it is in the United States and this to

134
00:05:20.91 --> 00:05:24.990
viewer well that's the secret of this

135
00:05:22.68 --> 00:05:26.820
small and wealthy country but this

136
00:05:24.99 --> 00:05:28.470
unites this only a part of the equation

137
00:05:26.82 --> 00:05:30.300
I mean not only does a country have to

138
00:05:28.47 --> 00:05:32.820
exploit the resources they have but they

139
00:05:30.3 --> 00:05:34.710
also need to use that money to generate

140
00:05:32.82 --> 00:05:37.380
other money or they're going to end up

141
00:05:34.71 --> 00:05:39.360
like Angola or Venezuela so it besides

142
00:05:37.38 --> 00:05:42.260
this innovative process Qatar has some

143
00:05:39.36 --> 00:05:42.260
other keys to their success

144
00:05:42.87 --> 00:05:49.580
[Music]

145
00:05:46.28 --> 00:05:49.580
katar power

146
00:05:50.42 --> 00:05:55.370
since Hamad bin Khalifa al-thani reached

147
00:05:52.7 --> 00:05:57.950
power in 1995 things they have changed

148
00:05:55.37 --> 00:05:59.570
significantly in his 18 years leading

149
00:05:57.95 --> 00:06:01.520
the country Qatar's population it's

150
00:05:59.57 --> 00:06:03.890
multiplied by five while at the same

151
00:06:01.52 --> 00:06:09.410
time it's become the richest country on

152
00:06:03.89 --> 00:06:11.660
earth so the old mayor he's got plenty

153
00:06:09.41 --> 00:06:13.760
of reasons to feel proud of himself but

154
00:06:11.66 --> 00:06:15.650
let's move on from this because Qatar is

155
00:06:13.76 --> 00:06:17.990
started to generate a lot of economic

156
00:06:15.65 --> 00:06:19.910
resources and the question now is what

157
00:06:17.99 --> 00:06:21.590
are they doing with this money whilst by

158
00:06:19.91 --> 00:06:23.990
what it may look like they've actually

159
00:06:21.59 --> 00:06:26.090
mostly invested it both nationally and

160
00:06:23.99 --> 00:06:29.000
internationally Qatar they've created

161
00:06:26.09 --> 00:06:32.000
the Qatar Investment Authority which is

162
00:06:29.0 --> 00:06:33.920
a huge funds to invest money all around

163
00:06:32.0 --> 00:06:35.660
the world it is known as Qatar's power

164
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:37.970
because they have in their hands more

165
00:06:35.66 --> 00:06:39.890
than three hundred and thirty billion

166
00:06:37.97 --> 00:06:41.900
dollars and when you consider that the

167
00:06:39.89 --> 00:06:43.940
population of Qatar is less than 3

168
00:06:41.9 --> 00:06:46.130
million people but of those 3 million

169
00:06:43.94 --> 00:06:49.280
people only 300 thousand are Qatari

170
00:06:46.13 --> 00:06:51.170
citizens well you can do the math this

171
00:06:49.28 --> 00:06:55.000
fund it has made significant real-estate

172
00:06:51.17 --> 00:06:55.000
investments all over the world

173
00:06:56.1 --> 00:07:00.240
in London a big part of the City belongs

174
00:06:58.14 --> 00:07:02.370
to Qatar including offices hotels

175
00:07:00.24 --> 00:07:05.160
apartments and swell in the United

176
00:07:02.37 --> 00:07:07.470
States Qatar was in 2016 the fourth

177
00:07:05.16 --> 00:07:09.810
largest office investor in the country

178
00:07:07.47 --> 00:07:11.880
in Manhattan alone that this fund has

179
00:07:09.81 --> 00:07:13.740
invested five billion dollars in the

180
00:07:11.88 --> 00:07:15.720
last two years spans they're not just

181
00:07:13.74 --> 00:07:18.180
investing in real estate this funds also

182
00:07:15.72 --> 00:07:19.980
has major shares in many multinationals

183
00:07:18.18 --> 00:07:21.900

184
00:07:19.98 --> 00:07:24.270
largest shareholders of companies like

185
00:07:21.9 --> 00:07:26.610
Volkswagen Iberdrola Barclays Bank

186
00:07:24.27 --> 00:07:28.590
Tiffany and Co shell or even the judge

187
00:07:26.61 --> 00:07:30.090
Roth's nest the oil company of the

188
00:07:28.59 --> 00:07:31.650
Russian government in the image I'm

189
00:07:30.09 --> 00:07:33.510
about to show you you can see how much

190
00:07:31.65 --> 00:07:37.610
foreign investment has increased as the

191
00:07:33.51 --> 00:07:37.610
production of gas and oil has grown

192
00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:42.559
and it's not just international

193
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.990
investment here they're also investing

194
00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:47.120
lots of resources inside the country

195
00:07:44.99 --> 00:07:49.759
tens of billions has been spent on

196
00:07:47.12 --> 00:07:53.270
highways ports airports research centers

197
00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:54.800
financial centers etc etc and so you

198
00:07:53.27 --> 00:07:56.839
might be asking now well what's the goal

199
00:07:54.8 --> 00:07:58.819
of all of this well that is to be able

200
00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:01.219
to in the future replace the income they

201
00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:03.439
get from oil and gas with income from

202
00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:04.909
all of these investments but you know at

203
00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:07.189
the moment when the gas business runs

204
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:10.159
out is still too far away to really be a

205
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:12.439
problem there are no analysts who can

206
00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:14.180
say when demand for gas will wane for

207
00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:16.699
oil there are people who see peak demand

208
00:08:14.18 --> 00:08:18.860
in 2030 others in 2040 too

209
00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:20.930
but for gas demand is constantly growing

210
00:08:18.86 --> 00:08:22.400
this idea they have of investing rather

211
00:08:20.93 --> 00:08:24.259
than spending the money from natural

212
00:08:22.4 --> 00:08:26.930
resources might be one of the most

213
00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.849
important differences between Qatar and

214
00:08:26.93 --> 00:08:31.189
other countries who are also rich in

215
00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:33.260
natural resources most of them they find

216
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:36.380
it too easy to spend the money today and

217
00:08:33.26 --> 00:08:39.349
not think too much about the future

219
00:08:39.349 --> 00:08:46.260
Ward's effective independence when Hamas

220
00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:48.060
bin Khalifa al-thani reached power he

221
00:08:46.26 --> 00:08:50.010
also had another thing in mind

222
00:08:48.06 --> 00:08:52.800
Qatar it had to gain international

223
00:08:50.01 --> 00:08:55.020
influence you see for years Qatar was

224
00:08:52.8 --> 00:08:57.270
controlled de-facto by Saudi Arabia and

225
00:08:55.02 --> 00:09:00.000
the new Emir just couldn't forget about

226
00:08:57.27 --> 00:09:02.010
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait if Qatar

227
00:09:00.0 --> 00:09:04.050
wanted to survive they needed to claim

228
00:09:02.01 --> 00:09:06.600
their identity and gain international

229
00:09:04.05 --> 00:09:08.670
influence otherwise any conflict with

230
00:09:06.6 --> 00:09:09.690
Radar could compromise the independence

231
00:09:08.67 --> 00:09:11.820
of the country

232
00:09:09.69 --> 00:09:14.460
besides well natural gas it could pay

233
00:09:11.82 --> 00:09:17.690
the bills now

[Music]

235
00:09:17.97 --> 00:09:23.729
so in 2003 when Saudi Arabia requested

236
00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:26.039
that the US take American troops out of

237
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:28.769
their country guitar didn't hesitate to

238
00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:31.019
offer itself as a destination for those

239
00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:33.269
troops they didn't even blink when it

240
00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.189
came to spending about a billion dollars

241
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:42.149
to build the military bases that were

242
00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:44.609
needed sprawling base 20 miles southwest

243
00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:47.369
of the Qatari capital of Doha is home to

244
00:09:44.609 --> 00:09:48.959
some 11,000 US military personnel indeed

245
00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:51.209
it could be said that Qatar has taken

246
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:53.309
out a very comprehensive insurance

247
00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:55.349
policy and well then we have the

248
00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:57.779
founding of al-jazeera this has the

249
00:09:55.349 --> 00:09:59.879
objective of obtaining global influence

250
00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:01.049
and well they succeeded and this is

251
00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.309
something we actually covered in a

252
00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:04.439
previous video that you should

253
00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:06.359
definitely check out they also developed

254
00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:13.920
a foreign policy driving towards

255
00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:16.230
international influence the blockade

256
00:10:13.92 --> 00:10:18.089
all this political strategy made both

257
00:10:16.23 --> 00:10:20.970
the United Arab Emirates and Saudi

258
00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:23.700
Arabia very angry and in June of 2017

259
00:10:20.97 --> 00:10:26.010
they announced a blockade accusing Qatar

260
00:10:23.7 --> 00:10:28.350
of supporting fundamentalist groups and

261
00:10:26.01 --> 00:10:30.209
terrorists and when it comes to Saudi

262
00:10:28.35 --> 00:10:32.480
Arabia we could definitely call this a

263
00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:35.430
case of the pot calling the kettle black

264
00:10:32.48 --> 00:10:37.019
now it is true that Qatar has some dark

265
00:10:35.43 --> 00:10:38.970
secrets I mean it is an absolute

266
00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:41.279
monarchy after all but the country is a

267
00:10:38.97 --> 00:10:43.110
good ally for the West especially the

268
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.880
United States and it's also one of the

269
00:10:43.11 --> 00:10:46.470
most open countries in the region the

270
00:10:44.88 --> 00:10:48.510
truth is that the boycotts it had a

271
00:10:46.47 --> 00:10:50.760
different target to cut down guitars

272
00:10:48.51 --> 00:10:52.620
strategy of international influence and

273
00:10:50.76 --> 00:10:54.990
to essentially put them back in their

274
00:10:52.62 --> 00:10:57.120
place however the blockade well it's

275
00:10:54.99 --> 00:10:59.130
been a total failure first radars

276
00:10:57.12 --> 00:11:00.480
position is not that strong very few

277
00:10:59.13 --> 00:11:03.389
countries have supported it

278
00:11:00.48 --> 00:11:04.829
not even Kuwait or a man also Qatar has

279
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:07.740
developed a better relationships with

280
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:09.089
Turkey and even Iran Qatar has simply

281
00:11:07.74 --> 00:11:11.519
proved that they are strong enough to

282
00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:12.779
weather the storm and finally it's

283
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.060
really important that we do make

284
00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:17.160
something clear there are plenty of gray

285
00:11:15.06 --> 00:11:19.170
areas in Qatar labor conditions that are

286
00:11:17.16 --> 00:11:21.480
more consistent with the ones of a poor

287
00:11:19.17 --> 00:11:23.519
country the situation of women in the

288
00:11:21.48 --> 00:11:25.470
country and the lack of a democracy

289
00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.880
furthermore the system needs to prove

290
00:11:25.47 --> 00:11:28.980
that it can work without the government

291
00:11:26.88 --> 00:11:31.560
because unlike Dubai the lead has been

292
00:11:28.98 --> 00:11:33.570
taken by public initiative not private

293
00:11:31.56 --> 00:11:36.149
and this is one of the reasons why Dubai

294
00:11:33.57 --> 00:11:37.860
is still above Qatar in pretty much all

295
00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:39.300
aspects but hey I mean it wouldn't be

296
00:11:37.86 --> 00:11:41.670
fair to not acknowledge what they're

297
00:11:39.3 --> 00:11:43.980
doing right like they're saving capacity

298
00:11:41.67 --> 00:11:45.810
their productive investment and their

299
00:11:43.98 --> 00:11:47.519
openness and while that's our opinion

300
00:11:45.81 --> 00:11:49.050
here a visual politic and now we would

301
00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.940
love to know what you think who do you

302
00:11:49.05 --> 00:11:52.829
think will win the battle of the

countries in the Persian Gulf Saudi

304
