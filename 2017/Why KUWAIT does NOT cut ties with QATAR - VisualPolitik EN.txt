3
00:00:06.74 --> 00:00:11.580
kuwait is along with guitar the only

4
00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.340
country in the Arabians and infinite

5
00:00:11.58 --> 00:00:15.059
where elections are held yes you heard

6
00:00:14.34 --> 00:00:16.590
that right

7
00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.750
many of you might move this country

8
00:00:16.59 --> 00:00:20.340
because of their oil reserves their

9
00:00:18.75 --> 00:00:23.430
wealth all the facts that they were

10
00:00:20.34 --> 00:00:26.070
invaded by saddam hussein in the 90s but

11
00:00:23.43 --> 00:00:27.960
Kuwaiti is much more than that it is one

12
00:00:26.07 --> 00:00:30.570
of the most tolerant nation in the

13
00:00:27.96 --> 00:00:32.550
Islamic world women can vote they can

14
00:00:30.57 --> 00:00:39.750
run for office and they even have a

15
00:00:32.55 --> 00:00:41.640
female MP but not only that for decades

16
00:00:39.75 --> 00:00:44.399
the Kuwaiti royal family has been

17
00:00:41.64 --> 00:00:46.649
America's best friend in the Gulf this

18
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.510
is why when they were invaded in 1990

19
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.399
Uncle Sam didn't hesitate for a moment

20
00:00:48.51 --> 00:00:54.030
and sent in their troops immediately

21
00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.270
this will not stand this will not stand

22
00:00:54.03 --> 00:00:59.280
this aggression against Kuwait and now

23
00:00:57.27 --> 00:01:02.309
you might wonder why are we talking

24
00:00:59.28 --> 00:01:05.129
today about Kuwait well this is the only

25
00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.860
Arab country alongside Amman that hasn't

26
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.119
joined the diplomatic block of Qatar

27
00:01:07.86 --> 00:01:12.820
[Music]

28
00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.890
Saudi Arabia Bahrain Egypt and the

29
00:01:12.82 --> 00:01:17.259
United Arab Emirates broke off relations

30
00:01:14.89 --> 00:01:19.390
with Qatar in the worst diplomatic

31
00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.549
crisis to hit the Gulf Arab states in

32
00:01:19.39 --> 00:01:23.859
decades the three Gulf countries and

33
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.630
Egypt accused Qatar of supporting

34
00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.030
terrorism and destabilizing the region

35
00:01:25.63 --> 00:01:30.310
and now the big question is why is to

36
00:01:28.03 --> 00:01:32.530
wage not on this list of nations who had

37
00:01:30.31 --> 00:01:34.600
cut ties with Qatar what kind of

38
00:01:32.53 --> 00:01:36.909
interest does this country have in this

39
00:01:34.6 --> 00:01:37.780
diplomatic crisis how does that mystical

40
00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.429
system work

41
00:01:37.78 --> 00:01:41.979
well today we are going to answer these

42
00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.360
questions but before we do let's get to

43
00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:49.030
know a bit more about this particular

44
00:01:43.36 --> 00:01:50.770
part of the planet is who in the Persian

45
00:01:49.03 --> 00:01:53.079
Gulf the first country we need to know

46
00:01:50.77 --> 00:01:56.079
about in the Arabian Peninsula is Saudi

47
00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.119
Arabia Saudi Arabia is the biggest

48
00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.299
country in the region both in terms of

49
00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.799
population and territory but it is not

50
00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.799
the only country here

51
00:02:05.15 --> 00:02:10.100
here we have the United Arab Emirates

52
00:02:07.49 --> 00:02:12.170
which Devine and Abu Dhabi are a part of

53
00:02:10.1 --> 00:02:14.450
this country has its own government its

54
00:02:12.17 --> 00:02:17.270
own laws and its own currency and is

55
00:02:14.45 --> 00:02:19.310
absolutely independent from the salaries

56
00:02:17.27 --> 00:02:21.110
the same goes for Qatar which has its

57
00:02:19.31 --> 00:02:22.970
own foreign policy and holds better

58
00:02:21.11 --> 00:02:27.430
public relations with enemies of the

59
00:02:22.97 --> 00:02:27.430
Saudis like the Islamic Republic of Iran

60
00:02:27.95 --> 00:02:32.180
and I'm everything that all of these

61
00:02:29.66 --> 00:02:34.160
countries have one important thing in

62
00:02:32.18 --> 00:02:37.250
common the fact that they are all

63
00:02:34.16 --> 00:02:39.260
incredibly oil-rich right well actually

64
00:02:37.25 --> 00:02:41.530
that's pretty wrong here we have the

65
00:02:39.26 --> 00:02:46.819
Republic of Yemen a country that is

66
00:02:41.53 --> 00:02:48.470
extremely poor now of course all of

67
00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.900
these countries have a common history

68
00:02:48.47 --> 00:02:53.480
common traditions as well as religion

69
00:02:50.9 --> 00:02:56.090
but make no mistake each of them have

70
00:02:53.48 --> 00:02:57.739
their own peculiarities for example the

71
00:02:56.09 --> 00:02:59.840
United Arab Emirates was the first

72
00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.090
country who realized oil is not forever

73
00:02:59.84 --> 00:03:04.910
and therefore they decided to diversify

74
00:03:02.09 --> 00:03:07.100
their economy so they crude represents

75
00:03:04.91 --> 00:03:11.540
just three percent of the total economy

76
00:03:07.1 --> 00:03:13.280
of divine Kuwait is also a totally

77
00:03:11.54 --> 00:03:15.920
different animal yes they have a lot of

78
00:03:13.28 --> 00:03:20.230
GeV so-called Emir but he is controlled

79
00:03:15.92 --> 00:03:22.700
by a constitution and the Parliament

80
00:03:20.23 --> 00:03:25.159
but the hulls on for just a second

81
00:03:22.7 --> 00:03:27.019
because this doesn't mean they are a 100

82
00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.030
percent democratic country in fact their

83
00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.010
system it's way more complicated than

84
00:03:29.03 --> 00:03:33.010
that so well let's have a look at it now

85
00:03:35.22 --> 00:03:41.180
[Music]

86
00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.879
how does semi democracy work in kuwait

87
00:03:41.18 --> 00:03:45.980
kuwait is known as a semi democracy

88
00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.829
unlike Saudi Arabia Kuwait have a

89
00:03:45.98 --> 00:03:50.840
freedom of religion this is why you can

90
00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.879
even find a Catholic Church in the

91
00:03:50.84 --> 00:03:58.190
middle of Kuwait City things like that

92
00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.290
your job on not mandatory and even the

93
00:03:58.19 --> 00:04:02.359
laws regarding alcohol they're fairly

94
00:04:00.29 --> 00:04:04.430
liberal in comparison with their natives

95
00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.829
of course it's still forbidden to buy

96
00:04:04.43 --> 00:04:08.239
and sell alcohol but it is legal to

97
00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.099
drink in private

98
00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.170
nonetheless the main peculiarities about

99
00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.970
Kuwait are their elections all the adult

100
00:04:12.17 --> 00:04:15.590
natural-born citizens have the right to

101
00:04:13.97 --> 00:04:17.329
vote their Parliament every four years

102
00:04:15.59 --> 00:04:20.900
this includes women in these elections

103
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.120
political parties are forbidden

104
00:04:20.9 --> 00:04:25.490
doesn't mean candidates have no ideology

105
00:04:23.12 --> 00:04:27.350
at all they can also campaign freely and

106
00:04:25.49 --> 00:04:29.360
have debates needless to say the

107
00:04:27.35 --> 00:04:31.370
political debate here is totally

108
00:04:29.36 --> 00:04:33.740
different compared to that in the UK for

109
00:04:31.37 --> 00:04:36.410
the u.s. here the political spectrum is

110
00:04:33.74 --> 00:04:37.880
not only a right wing left wing kind of

111
00:04:36.41 --> 00:04:39.680
thing of course some candidates are

112
00:04:37.88 --> 00:04:42.820
highly conservative and others are more

113
00:04:39.68 --> 00:04:45.770
liberal and open to Western culture but

114
00:04:42.82 --> 00:04:48.139
this is not the only thing that divides

115
00:04:45.77 --> 00:04:50.030
Kuwaiti society there is also this

116
00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.729
never-ending fight between Sonny Muslims

117
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:55.130
and Shia Muslims this is because as I

118
00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.870
said before there is freedom of religion

119
00:04:55.13 --> 00:04:59.150
and that means the creed of the

120
00:04:56.87 --> 00:05:02.150
candidate is an important disease tax

121
00:04:59.15 --> 00:05:04.610
plan but not only that there is another

122
00:05:02.15 --> 00:05:06.320
big divide between the so called urban

123
00:05:04.61 --> 00:05:08.360
voters and the so called

124
00:05:06.32 --> 00:05:10.280
tribal ones just think about it for a

125
00:05:08.36 --> 00:05:12.560
moment this is a country with a long

126
00:05:10.28 --> 00:05:14.660
nomadic tradition with half of the

127
00:05:12.56 --> 00:05:17.330
population still living in tribes and

128
00:05:14.66 --> 00:05:20.730
these trying to hold their own primaries

129
00:05:17.33 --> 00:05:24.029
to choose their own candidate

130
00:05:20.73 --> 00:05:24.029
[Music]

131
00:05:24.16 --> 00:05:29.449
well said elections are used to choose a

132
00:05:27.26 --> 00:05:32.360
national assembly with the power to make

133
00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.270
laws and even put a veto on the policies

134
00:05:32.36 --> 00:05:37.130
taken by the executive branch at 911

135
00:05:35.27 --> 00:05:39.470
wondering how do they treat the Prime

136
00:05:37.13 --> 00:05:41.030
Minister are they voted for by MPs as

137
00:05:39.47 --> 00:05:42.740
they do the European countries or do

138
00:05:41.03 --> 00:05:47.180
they hold presidential elections like

139
00:05:42.74 --> 00:05:49.940
they do in the USA well it's actually

140
00:05:47.18 --> 00:05:53.000
nothing like Indra so as I said Kuwait

141
00:05:49.94 --> 00:05:55.550
is a semi democracy this means that the

142
00:05:53.0 --> 00:05:57.950
head of state is the Emir and he Tunes

143
00:05:55.55 --> 00:05:59.930
the Prime Minister and his cabinet so

144
00:05:57.95 --> 00:06:01.880
maybe this sounds like those European

145
00:05:59.93 --> 00:06:04.130
absolute monarchies that you studied

146
00:06:01.88 --> 00:06:05.780
about his history there well it's not

147
00:06:04.13 --> 00:06:07.639
really exactly like that

148
00:06:05.78 --> 00:06:10.280
in fact in Arab monarchies the position

149
00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.320
of Emir is not inherited this is why in

150
00:06:10.28 --> 00:06:15.110
Saudi Arabia they have big internal

151
00:06:12.32 --> 00:06:16.820
battles to choose their leaders and as I

152
00:06:15.11 --> 00:06:18.830
explained in a previous video royal

153
00:06:16.82 --> 00:06:20.390
families in this part of the world can

154
00:06:18.83 --> 00:06:23.669
have thousands of members

155
00:06:20.39 --> 00:06:25.919
[Music]

156
00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.810
so in the case of create the members of

157
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.479
the royal family the so-called al

158
00:06:27.81 --> 00:06:32.789
Sabbagh house can vote for the Emir but

159
00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.919
right after the National Assembly has to

160
00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.349
vote on whether they can accept this

161
00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.699
decision or not this whole one now for

162
00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:40.529
just a second because the just engaging

163
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.349
system wasn't complicated enough

164
00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:45.779
here is another extra fact the

165
00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:48.240
Constitution allows the Emir to dissolve

166
00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:50.340
the Parliament many time you want sound

167
00:06:48.24 --> 00:06:55.800
well that's something he does pretty

168
00:06:50.34 --> 00:06:58.020
often here of Kuwait dissolves

169
00:06:55.8 --> 00:06:59.939
Parliament the move announced on state

170
00:06:58.02 --> 00:07:01.770
media after an emergency government

171
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.080
meeting sets the stage for early

172
00:07:01.77 --> 00:07:06.000
elections and believe me parliamentary

173
00:07:04.08 --> 00:07:08.490
debates into eight are far from being

174
00:07:06.0 --> 00:07:10.259
quiet emergency meetings are a common

175
00:07:08.49 --> 00:07:12.210
thing and sometimes it's really hard to

176
00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.430
get any kind of consensus for some

177
00:07:12.21 --> 00:07:17.479
analysts this is one of the reasons that

178
00:07:14.43 --> 00:07:17.479
explain this

179
00:07:18.61 --> 00:07:23.500
a cruder holic economy we all know it

180
00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.810
oil rich countries have so much money

181
00:07:23.5 --> 00:07:26.530
they can spend as if there was no

182
00:07:25.81 --> 00:07:29.139
tomorrow

183
00:07:26.53 --> 00:07:31.120
most natural born 280 citizens work as

184
00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.189
civil servants for the government they

185
00:07:31.12 --> 00:07:35.620
pay no income tax their energy bills are

186
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:40.120
subsidized and their salary is well

187
00:07:35.62 --> 00:07:41.289
they're ludicrously high the people who

188
00:07:40.12 --> 00:07:43.629
work on oil rigs

189
00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:46.599
well stead of foreigners but this is not

190
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.800
only a reality for to ace it happens all

191
00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:49.539
over the region

192
00:07:47.8 --> 00:07:51.550
black gold has allowed all of these

193
00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:57.270
countries to enjoy this way of life

194
00:07:51.55 --> 00:07:59.370
[Music]

195
00:07:57.27 --> 00:08:00.990
but the big question is well what

196
00:07:59.37 --> 00:08:03.060
happens now as you probably know the

197
00:08:00.99 --> 00:08:04.710
market price for crude oil has fallen in

198
00:08:03.06 --> 00:08:07.020
recent years of course these oil

199
00:08:04.71 --> 00:08:09.300
monarchies are still making profits but

200
00:08:07.02 --> 00:08:11.070
not enough to keep that system going and

201
00:08:09.3 --> 00:08:13.770
this is why it today all of these

202
00:08:11.07 --> 00:08:16.290
countries ask fiscal deficits this means

203
00:08:13.77 --> 00:08:17.700
their spending is way higher than their

204
00:08:16.29 --> 00:08:21.800
income

205
00:08:17.7 --> 00:08:21.800
[Music]

206
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.629
pay any attention through the chart here

207
00:08:24.68 --> 00:08:28.610
even the USA a country which is really

208
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:32.390
worried about his deficit is doing

209
00:08:28.61 --> 00:08:33.829
better than these country and now you

210
00:08:32.39 --> 00:08:36.110
might wonder what does this figure

211
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:37.820
actually mean well this means that if

212
00:08:36.11 --> 00:08:40.219
the two AG's don't want to go bankrupt

213
00:08:37.82 --> 00:08:42.740
in just a few years they'd better find

214
00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:45.230
some alternative incomes and not rely

215
00:08:42.74 --> 00:08:46.550
entirely on oil nonetheless despite you

216
00:08:45.23 --> 00:08:48.649
eight having the most modern and

217
00:08:46.55 --> 00:08:56.390
democratic political system they have

218
00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:58.430
the highest dependence on crude oil even

219
00:08:56.39 --> 00:09:00.410
Saudi Arabia regressive as they are is

220
00:08:58.43 --> 00:09:02.329
better prepared for a planet in the

221
00:09:00.41 --> 00:09:04.730
price of oil and this is a surprise for

222
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:07.070
everybody because during the 1970s to

223
00:09:04.73 --> 00:09:09.500
eight was the rock star of the region

224
00:09:07.07 --> 00:09:11.300
now this title goes to Dubai despite it

225
00:09:09.5 --> 00:09:12.769
being an absolute monarchy and this is

226
00:09:11.3 --> 00:09:15.290
less than any Arab is wondering whether

227
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:22.640
democracy is compatible with economic

228
00:09:15.29 --> 00:09:24.620
reform we have stagnated frustrating the

229
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:26.690
people of a country once seen as a

230
00:09:24.62 --> 00:09:28.850
Middle East Trailblazer let's say that

231
00:09:26.69 --> 00:09:30.949
you want to start a logistics company in

232
00:09:28.85 --> 00:09:33.110
Dubai you just need to buy some land and

233
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:35.990
build the facilities right well thank

234
00:09:33.11 --> 00:09:37.699
you wait this is almost impossible the

235
00:09:35.99 --> 00:09:39.620
government owns 90 percent of the

236
00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:42.199
territory on the other hand bureaucracy

237
00:09:39.62 --> 00:09:43.880
has reached insane levels according to

238
00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:46.220
the World Bank it's easier to start a

239
00:09:43.88 --> 00:09:50.380
business in countries like Ukraine or El

240
00:09:46.22 --> 00:09:50.380
Salvador and than it is in Kuwait

241
00:09:51.57 --> 00:09:56.880
and all of this is despite the fact that

242
00:09:54.449 --> 00:09:59.040
q8 has a lower corporate tax rate within

243
00:09:56.88 --> 00:10:00.930
Luxembourg added to this are the sky

244
00:09:59.04 --> 00:10:03.000
high salaries and civil workers which

245
00:10:00.93 --> 00:10:04.980
rise year after year and you can

246
00:10:03.0 --> 00:10:06.870
probably imagine it that no one is going

247
00:10:04.98 --> 00:10:08.940
to become an entrepreneur and leave

248
00:10:06.87 --> 00:10:10.980
behind the comfort and safety of a

249
00:10:08.94 --> 00:10:12.620
government job even the Kuwaitis

250
00:10:10.98 --> 00:10:14.910
enclosure and they're learning outside

251
00:10:12.62 --> 00:10:17.250
because they cannot do business degree

252
00:10:14.91 --> 00:10:19.110
they try to do the short-term good in

253
00:10:17.25 --> 00:10:21.420
the short term but now all of a sudden

254
00:10:19.11 --> 00:10:23.639
the Qatari crisis has offered create a

255
00:10:21.42 --> 00:10:25.410
chance to emerge as a regional leader

256
00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:26.970
their royal house has good relationships

257
00:10:25.41 --> 00:10:29.730
with all the countries involved

258
00:10:26.97 --> 00:10:34.230
including the United States Saudi Arabia

259
00:10:29.73 --> 00:10:36.060
and Qatar but their political system is

260
00:10:34.23 --> 00:10:38.069
the most open and democratic in the

261
00:10:36.06 --> 00:10:40.440
region in other words they have the best

262
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:44.480
chance of becoming a mediator in this

263
00:10:40.44 --> 00:10:44.480
crisis and they're well aware

264
00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:50.240
wait to the mirror to travel to Saudi

265
00:10:47.99 --> 00:10:52.279
for Qatar talks so now the question

266
00:10:50.24 --> 00:10:54.769
becomes do you think two ways can take

267
00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:56.749
back its role as a regional leader can

268
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:58.850
this crisis help them to showcase their

269
00:10:56.749 --> 00:11:00.740
country for foreign investment well let
