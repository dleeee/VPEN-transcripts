00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:12.630
ah Ron the country where the far-right

2
00:00:09.75 --> 00:00:15.150
wing as it is known today was born way

3
00:00:12.63 --> 00:00:16.710
before the financial crisis way before

4
00:00:15.15 --> 00:00:18.930
Donald Trump the game the President of

5
00:00:16.71 --> 00:00:20.609
the United States way before brexit and

6
00:00:18.93 --> 00:00:24.060
the uprising of xenophobic parties in

7
00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.760
Europe way before all of that France had

8
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:29.340
an extreme Nationalist Party the

9
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:34.770
National Front and it had a real chance

10
00:00:29.34 --> 00:00:36.270
to win an election actually in 2002 the

11
00:00:34.77 --> 00:00:38.070
rest of the political players in the

12
00:00:36.27 --> 00:00:40.530
country from the center left to the

13
00:00:38.07 --> 00:00:41.910
center-right had to join forces just to

14
00:00:40.53 --> 00:00:44.430
keep a strong marine lepen

15
00:00:41.91 --> 00:00:47.100
from becoming the president of France in

16
00:00:44.43 --> 00:00:49.289
April 2017 French people are going back

17
00:00:47.1 --> 00:00:50.969
to the voting stations and a lot of

18
00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.190
people think that this is the ultimate

19
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.620
chance for the far-right wing

20
00:00:53.19 --> 00:00:57.750
in France the moment where the National

21
00:00:55.62 --> 00:01:00.719
Front with marine lepen has its leader

22
00:00:57.75 --> 00:01:02.489
and get the presidential office once and

23
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.229
for all if this was the case marine

24
00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.360
lepen who by the way is the daughter of

25
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.040
jean-marie Le Pen has promised that she

26
00:01:06.36 --> 00:01:10.110
will do everything she can to take a

27
00:01:08.04 --> 00:01:12.090
country out of the European Union but

28
00:01:10.11 --> 00:01:14.280
not only that Frances the second largest

29
00:01:12.09 --> 00:01:16.290
country in continental Europe a victory

30
00:01:14.28 --> 00:01:18.270
for the extreme right would be a triumph

31
00:01:16.29 --> 00:01:18.810
for all far-right parties on the

32
00:01:18.27 --> 00:01:20.260
continent

you

35
00:01:23.27 --> 00:01:28.020
but do just wait one minute because the

36
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:30.420
question is really does marine lepen

37
00:01:28.02 --> 00:01:32.370
have a real chance of winning this

38
00:01:30.42 --> 00:01:35.250
election is there anyone out there who

39
00:01:32.37 --> 00:01:36.900
can possibly suffer today we are going

40
00:01:35.25 --> 00:01:38.910
to answer all of these questions and

41
00:01:36.9 --> 00:01:40.920
we're going to get to know in depth the

42
00:01:38.91 --> 00:01:44.100
history of the French extreme right a

43
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:49.250
story that includes Wars ego clashes and

44
00:01:44.1 --> 00:01:52.470
well playmates so let's get into it

45
00:01:49.25 --> 00:01:54.990
lepen clan the French extreme right has

46
00:01:52.47 --> 00:01:58.380
two ideological grandparents Adolf

47
00:01:54.99 --> 00:02:00.180
Hitler and the OAS and you know during

48
00:01:58.38 --> 00:02:01.580
World War Two the Germans invaded the

49
00:02:00.18 --> 00:02:03.869
north of front

[Music]

51
00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.399
the South the so-called free zone whose

52
00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.709
capital with Vichy was governed by

53
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.230
French politicians who supported the

54
00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.090
German national socialism when war ended

55
00:02:13.23 --> 00:02:17.280
the new president General Charles de

56
00:02:15.09 --> 00:02:18.930
Gaulle executed the main official from

57
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:19.980
Vichy but do wait one minute again

58
00:02:18.93 --> 00:02:21.840
because there were many people who

59
00:02:19.98 --> 00:02:23.849
supported this collaborationist

60
00:02:21.84 --> 00:02:25.620
government people that even without

61
00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.200
having too little power held the same

62
00:02:25.62 --> 00:02:30.570
principles and the same ideals as the

63
00:02:28.2 --> 00:02:33.480
National Socialists from Nazi Germany

[Music]

65
00:02:33.48 --> 00:02:38.489
and many of them were in the army

66
00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:40.920
decades later in 1961 the French lets

67
00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.410
their most precious colony Algeria hold

68
00:02:40.92 --> 00:02:44.970
a self-determination referendum as you

69
00:02:43.41 --> 00:02:46.950
can imagine this was not great news for

70
00:02:44.97 --> 00:02:49.319
all of those far-right extremists inside

71
00:02:46.95 --> 00:02:51.510
the French army this is how the OAS was

72
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.730
born the OAS was a terrorist group whose

73
00:02:51.51 --> 00:02:55.920
main goal with the end of the Algerian

74
00:02:53.73 --> 00:02:58.910
attempt to the independence we are not

75
00:02:55.92 --> 00:03:01.290
terrorists to understand we are patriots

76
00:02:58.91 --> 00:03:03.060
our duty is to the soldiers who died

77
00:03:01.29 --> 00:03:04.560
fighting in Algeria and with the three

78
00:03:03.06 --> 00:03:07.440
million French citizens why what was it

79
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:10.440
there so did they succeed well actually

80
00:03:07.44 --> 00:03:12.750
no in 1962 Algeria became a sovereign

81
00:03:10.44 --> 00:03:14.280
state and then the OAS changed their

82
00:03:12.75 --> 00:03:15.930
goals and trying to kill the French

83
00:03:14.28 --> 00:03:18.630
president himself they thought that the

84
00:03:15.93 --> 00:03:20.400
goal was a traitor to France fortunately

85
00:03:18.63 --> 00:03:22.440
though in 1965 the French police

86
00:03:20.4 --> 00:03:24.030
dismantled the last cells of this group

87
00:03:22.44 --> 00:03:25.620
just like what happens after the end of

88
00:03:24.03 --> 00:03:26.220
world war things out of jailing the

89
00:03:25.62 --> 00:03:27.569
hardliners

90
00:03:26.22 --> 00:03:31.519
didn't mean there were no people

91
00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.519
supporting the generals course

92
00:03:33.33 --> 00:03:38.280
from the country's liberty equality and

93
00:03:35.7 --> 00:03:40.680
fraternity has a large amount of people

94
00:03:38.28 --> 00:03:43.140
who hated the Algerians and having them

95
00:03:40.68 --> 00:03:45.300
soldiers of the Third Reich and this was

96
00:03:43.14 --> 00:03:47.580
the foundation that jean-marie the pen

97
00:03:45.3 --> 00:03:50.610
used to build ten years later the

98
00:03:47.58 --> 00:03:53.640
National Front solution to the media

99
00:03:50.61 --> 00:03:56.490
when we talk about the war over and over

100
00:03:53.64 --> 00:03:59.130
every day we are reminded of what would

101
00:03:56.49 --> 00:04:01.290
war the persecution of the Jews

102
00:03:59.13 --> 00:04:03.660
the excessive behavior of the occupying

103
00:04:01.29 --> 00:04:05.400
forces and so on the beginning of this

104
00:04:03.66 --> 00:04:06.690
party with no easy thing during the

105
00:04:05.4 --> 00:04:08.820
nineteen seventies the National Front

106
00:04:06.69 --> 00:04:11.040
would never get more than five percent

107
00:04:08.82 --> 00:04:12.870
of the vote and the real upend himself

108
00:04:11.04 --> 00:04:13.440
suffered a terrorist attack in his own

109
00:04:12.87 --> 00:04:15.840
house

110
00:04:13.44 --> 00:04:18.959
now this though is when the really good

111
00:04:15.84 --> 00:04:21.269
parts are in 1977 that Philip M family

112
00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.310
inherited from a fellow supporter an

113
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.389
entire palace

114
00:04:23.31 --> 00:04:29.090
[Music]

115
00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.349
this was the mantra to Palace soon this

116
00:04:29.09 --> 00:04:33.379
would become the unofficial headquarters

117
00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.870
for the National Front or as we probably

118
00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.270
could just say villa pen family yes my

119
00:04:35.87 --> 00:04:40.930
friends with this party everything does

120
00:04:38.27 --> 00:04:40.930
stay in the family

121
00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.280
Gonzalez jean-marie organized all those

122
00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.289
electoral campaigns that made him the

123
00:04:46.28 --> 00:04:49.849
third biggest political force in France

124
00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.949
at the end of the nineteen eighty-three

125
00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.199
was his daughter marine lepen was

126
00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.210
following him and learning the secret of

127
00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.009
the art of politics in order to become

128
00:04:56.21 --> 00:05:00.020
the leader that she is today

129
00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.240
later his granddaughter Mary all of em

130
00:05:00.02 --> 00:05:04.129
would follow him to and she is now an MP

131
00:05:02.24 --> 00:05:05.810
in the French parliament and a rising

132
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.639
star in the National Front interestingly

133
00:05:05.81 --> 00:05:09.439
though even though his party

134
00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.169
congratulate him as the champion of

135
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.069
Family Values the tennis family is far

136
00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.900
from a happy one

137
00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.789
yes yes I do know here visual politic we

138
00:05:14.9 --> 00:05:19.219
really don't like to gossip about anyone

139
00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.529
but in this case it's kind of absolutely

140
00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.529
necessary do you understand me political

141
00:05:24.16 --> 00:05:29.210
[Music]

142
00:05:26.11 --> 00:05:31.759
like that in the 1980s Oh Marie Levin

143
00:05:29.21 --> 00:05:34.339
who we will now call the pen fumiya was

144
00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.750
on fire in every election he was getting

145
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.279
more and more votes than the previous

146
00:05:35.75 --> 00:05:39.349
one it was during this time that he

147
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:42.379
decided to hire a journalist Katoon

148
00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.909
write his own biography and of course he

149
00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.909
led the journalists palace

150
00:05:46.65 --> 00:05:51.819
so can you guess what this journalist

151
00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.699
did well you probably can't unless you

152
00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.460
already know he seduced lepen wife oh

153
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.800
but it's not just that these two lovers

154
00:05:57.46 --> 00:06:01.659
then ran away from the palace and months

155
00:05:59.8 --> 00:06:04.120
later misses with them with on the cover

156
00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.580
of French Playboy magazine and this is

157
00:06:04.12 --> 00:06:19.270
how the whole world discovered the more

158
00:06:06.58 --> 00:06:20.979
sensual side of the extreme right now

159
00:06:19.27 --> 00:06:22.870
this course a split in the family no

160
00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.909
matter how good the father was doing in

161
00:06:22.87 --> 00:06:26.529
the elections his daughter still grew

162
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.689
more and more distant from him but the

163
00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:31.719
real turning point in the lepen family

164
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.729
would come in the year 2002 this was a

165
00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.439
year when France had presidential

166
00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.930
elections and for the first time in

167
00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:40.139
history full of em went to the second

168
00:06:37.93 --> 00:06:40.139
round

169
00:06:40.87 --> 00:06:45.170
now as you might know the French

170
00:06:42.86 --> 00:06:46.550
electoral system has to round when they

171
00:06:45.17 --> 00:06:48.410
are choosing president in the first

172
00:06:46.55 --> 00:06:50.330
rounds they can choose from all of the

173
00:06:48.41 --> 00:06:51.950
candidates however many that may be and

174
00:06:50.33 --> 00:06:53.660
in the second round you can only vote

175
00:06:51.95 --> 00:06:56.060
for the two most successful candidates

176
00:06:53.66 --> 00:06:57.470
in the first round welcomed in 2002 the

177
00:06:56.06 --> 00:06:59.090
ones who needed into the second round

178
00:06:57.47 --> 00:07:01.580
were shocked Chirac from the center

179
00:06:59.09 --> 00:07:02.740
right-wing party and lapentti Nia from

180
00:07:01.58 --> 00:07:03.830
being extreme right

181
00:07:02.74 --> 00:07:04.910
[Music]

182
00:07:03.83 --> 00:07:07.250

[Music]

184
00:07:07.25 --> 00:07:10.130
and so now you might be wondering how

185
00:07:09.05 --> 00:07:11.840
did it happen that there was two

186
00:07:10.13 --> 00:07:13.820
right-wing candidates so means are the

187
00:07:11.84 --> 00:07:15.860
notables in France well during these

188
00:07:13.82 --> 00:07:18.920
years lepen learned an important lesson

189
00:07:15.86 --> 00:07:21.110
in politics the idea of the captive

190
00:07:18.92 --> 00:07:23.120
voter as though that is going to find

191
00:07:21.11 --> 00:07:24.980
some principles of the party attractive

192
00:07:23.12 --> 00:07:26.750
no matter where they stand on the

193
00:07:24.98 --> 00:07:28.700
political spectrum but then stood for

194
00:07:26.75 --> 00:07:31.040
protectionism French companies but also

195
00:07:28.7 --> 00:07:32.480
for French workers remember the America

196
00:07:31.04 --> 00:07:33.980
first thing that ron was going on about

197
00:07:32.48 --> 00:07:36.350
yeah well it turns out that's not

198
00:07:33.98 --> 00:07:39.410
Trump's invention we defined the pen in

199
00:07:36.35 --> 00:07:41.420
the 1990 so in 2002 industrial cities

200
00:07:39.41 --> 00:07:44.120
like Marseille who used to be left-wing

201
00:07:41.42 --> 00:07:47.410
strongholds voted for the National Front

202
00:07:44.12 --> 00:07:47.410
[Music]

203
00:07:47.97 --> 00:07:52.479
and this is why in that second round

204
00:07:50.47 --> 00:07:54.639
those who remained loyal to the Social

205
00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.830
Democratic Party had to swallow their

206
00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:59.199
pride and food so shag share act to the

207
00:07:56.83 --> 00:08:00.880
center right Candice I mean anything was

208
00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:03.380
better than the uprising of a racist

209
00:08:00.88 --> 00:08:07.199
extreme conservatives like lahpet

210
00:08:03.38 --> 00:08:09.909
[Music]

211
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.159
and digits elder lepen family learned a

212
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:14.469
second important lesson in politics it

213
00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:17.019
is not only important to be accepted by

214
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:18.639
your own voters you also can't be too

215
00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:20.679
scary to the other people if your

216
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:22.479
opposition are too frightened they might

217
00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:28.449
join forces to prevent you from getting

218
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:31.479
into that presidential palace Rheem vs.

219
00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:33.099
jean-marie versus Merry Christmas was

220
00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:35.889
another great time for the family after

221
00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:38.199
2002 marine lepen started our internal

222
00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:39.939
campaign against her father now don't

223
00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:42.370
forget that jean-marie Le Pen was a

224
00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:45.430
politician that ran for elections with

225
00:08:42.37 --> 00:08:47.920
statements like this one there has to be

226
00:08:45.43 --> 00:08:50.620
an authority always and we believe that

227
00:08:47.92 --> 00:08:52.389
in a household the best one to have

228
00:08:50.62 --> 00:08:55.240
disabilities is the man nonetheless

229
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:57.160
marine lepen was a woman ready to have

230
00:08:55.24 --> 00:08:58.839
authority and modernize a political

231
00:08:57.16 --> 00:09:01.180
party that would honestly make Windows

232
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:03.639
95 look like a piece of state-of-the-art

233
00:09:01.18 --> 00:09:05.889
software now unlike asada marine

234
00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:08.079
supported gay civil unions and was

235
00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:09.519
against the death penalty even National

236
00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:12.639
Front voters could appreciate these

237
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:14.800
changes and this is why in 2011 lepen

238
00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:16.329
jr. took her father's place as the

239
00:09:14.8 --> 00:09:18.160
party's leader our that do you know

240
00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:19.689
things are things with a DP the equities

241
00:09:18.16 --> 00:09:22.120
you've posted okay I wonder what

242
00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:23.649
motivated marine and her deputies in

243
00:09:22.12 --> 00:09:26.170
this offensive they have been launched

244
00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:27.670
against me issues of July just think

245
00:09:26.17 --> 00:09:29.620
about it when you've been the founder

246
00:09:27.67 --> 00:09:31.870
and the leader of a French far-right

247
00:09:29.62 --> 00:09:34.059
political party for 39 years it's not

248
00:09:31.87 --> 00:09:36.069
going to be easy taking orders from your

249
00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:38.050
daughter so even though today jean-marie

250
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:40.120
Le Pen is the honorary president of the

251
00:09:38.05 --> 00:09:42.220
National Front he also votes as an

252
00:09:40.12 --> 00:09:44.949
independent at the European Parliament

253
00:09:42.22 --> 00:09:45.639
he'd say my campaigns not from marine

254
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:48.879
lepen

255
00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:50.740
but for jean-marie Le Pen and I won 33%

256
00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:52.569
and yet he's his main supporter inside

257
00:09:50.74 --> 00:09:54.129
of the family surprise surprise family

258
00:09:52.569 --> 00:09:56.410
business again it's his granddaughter

259
00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:58.840
Mary on lepen who is starting her own

260
00:09:56.41 --> 00:10:02.110
battle against her haunts Marie

261
00:09:58.84 --> 00:10:04.840
politician right is a provocateur and

262
00:10:02.11 --> 00:10:07.090
anti conformist and it isn't always nice

263
00:10:04.84 --> 00:10:08.680
to hear meanwhile Marines moderation in

264
00:10:07.09 --> 00:10:10.779
combination with the end of the crisis

265
00:10:08.68 --> 00:10:12.430
in France are working way better than

266
00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:14.980
the radical strategies of our Father

267
00:10:12.43 --> 00:10:17.110
cannot grasp ok consider okay little pal

268
00:10:14.98 --> 00:10:19.360
committee I considered Europe has made a

269
00:10:17.11 --> 00:10:20.910
mistake in the past they should have

270
00:10:19.36 --> 00:10:23.650
started cooperation and development

271
00:10:20.91 --> 00:10:25.180
relationships of Africa this way they

272
00:10:23.65 --> 00:10:27.940
would have fixed the people in their own

273
00:10:25.18 --> 00:10:31.029
countries in fact the latest horses for

274
00:10:27.94 --> 00:10:33.010
this 2017 election gives her close to 25

275
00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:35.470
percent of the vote this makes every

276
00:10:33.01 --> 00:10:38.529
first or second biggest candidate and in

277
00:10:35.47 --> 00:10:41.440
an election with five candidates 25% is

278
00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:43.150
a big thing it is always certain that

279
00:10:41.44 --> 00:10:44.710
she will make it into the second round

280
00:10:43.15 --> 00:10:46.630
but do you consider that just because

281
00:10:44.71 --> 00:10:48.640
she is less radical than her father this

282
00:10:46.63 --> 00:10:52.230
doesn't mean the Perrine is a moderate

283
00:10:48.64 --> 00:10:52.230
in fact far from it

284
00:10:54.91 --> 00:11:00.680
fameless' 144 points of her electoral

285
00:10:58.31 --> 00:11:02.180
manifesto lepen Junius stands for

286
00:11:00.68 --> 00:11:04.640
closing frontiers of massive

287
00:11:02.18 --> 00:11:06.710
deportations the exit of the European

288
00:11:04.64 --> 00:11:09.860
Union and we return as the French

289
00:11:06.71 --> 00:11:12.080
currency in total Castle combat document

290
00:11:09.86 --> 00:11:15.020
all the same economic views as Vladimir

291
00:11:12.08 --> 00:11:15.470
Putin this is true but this is nothing

292
00:11:15.02 --> 00:11:17.270
new

293
00:11:15.47 --> 00:11:19.520
either alright so you know if you're

294
00:11:17.27 --> 00:11:21.230
probably know wondering well can lepen

295
00:11:19.52 --> 00:11:23.390
actually become the next president of

296
00:11:21.23 --> 00:11:29.150
France so let's address this question

297
00:11:23.39 --> 00:11:31.339
with another question can start ahead

298
00:11:29.15 --> 00:11:33.890
for years the center right wing in front

299
00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:36.290
saw how the pen could feel their votes

300
00:11:33.89 --> 00:11:38.120
yes it is true that a big share of the

301
00:11:36.29 --> 00:11:40.580
National Front votes come from the left

302
00:11:38.12 --> 00:11:42.680
wing but in a time of crisis family

303
00:11:40.58 --> 00:11:44.900
values and anti-immigrant sentiments are

304
00:11:42.68 --> 00:11:48.020
particularly attractive to conservative

305
00:11:44.9 --> 00:11:50.060
voters so in 2016 the big party of the

306
00:11:48.02 --> 00:11:52.220
center rice the Republicans chose a

307
00:11:50.06 --> 00:11:54.860
candidate you also put forward some of

308
00:11:52.22 --> 00:11:59.080
these proposals that made lepen famous

309
00:11:54.86 --> 00:11:59.080
this man was Francois Fiat

310
00:11:59.16 --> 00:12:06.029
[Music]

311
00:12:02.52 --> 00:12:07.589
so in the strategy of working well well

312
00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:09.060
apparently not

313
00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:10.290
since senior became the party's

314
00:12:09.06 --> 00:12:12.000
candidate the Republicans have been

315
00:12:10.29 --> 00:12:13.709
falling on the polls and they are now

316
00:12:12.0 --> 00:12:15.589
fighting for third position with far

317
00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:17.730
right-wing party of jean-luc mélenchon

318
00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:19.260
corruption sex scandals and the fact

319
00:12:17.73 --> 00:12:21.360
that people prefer the original to the

320
00:12:19.26 --> 00:12:26.760
copy this is course pinyon and the

321
00:12:21.36 --> 00:12:28.800
center-right to fall into a Libyan but

322
00:12:26.76 --> 00:12:31.020
there is still hope the battle is not

323
00:12:28.8 --> 00:12:33.330
over there is still a man who could be

324
00:12:31.02 --> 00:12:35.220
ready to stop the Pens Huracan his name

325
00:12:33.33 --> 00:12:36.570
is Emmanuel macron and he was the

326
00:12:35.22 --> 00:12:42.810
finance minister during the government

327
00:12:36.57 --> 00:12:45.660
of Manuel Valls alright so in the manual

328
00:12:42.81 --> 00:12:47.100
macron a socialist elmo macron is

329
00:12:45.66 --> 00:12:47.760
running in the elections as an

330
00:12:47.1 --> 00:12:49.680
independent

331
00:12:47.76 --> 00:12:51.300
even Manuel Valls himself didn't

332
00:12:49.68 --> 00:12:53.250
supported in public until relatively

333
00:12:51.3 --> 00:12:55.560
recently so what does Emmanuel macron

334
00:12:53.25 --> 00:12:58.310
stand for basically he stands to the

335
00:12:55.56 --> 00:12:58.310
opposite of La Paz

336
00:12:59.7 --> 00:13:02.880
[Music]

337
00:13:00.3 --> 00:13:05.440
[Applause]

338
00:13:02.88 --> 00:13:07.360
McCarron wants to end the privileges and

339
00:13:05.44 --> 00:13:09.070
subsidies that French companies get he

340
00:13:07.36 --> 00:13:10.690
wants to end the barriers that made it

341
00:13:09.07 --> 00:13:12.490
impossible for the French youth to get a

342
00:13:10.69 --> 00:13:14.410
job and the course years against

343
00:13:12.49 --> 00:13:16.360
discrimination based on race or religion

344
00:13:14.41 --> 00:13:18.610
when it comes to the economy wants to be

345
00:13:16.36 --> 00:13:20.920
a champion for deficit reduction has

346
00:13:18.61 --> 00:13:22.990
fiscal responsibility and as if that was

347
00:13:20.92 --> 00:13:25.089
not enough one of his proposals is to

348
00:13:22.99 --> 00:13:26.830
forbid high-ranking officials to employ

349
00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:28.899
their own family in Salida the

350
00:13:26.83 --> 00:13:30.940
administration so as you can see here's

351
00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:32.500
the antithesis of marine lepen and

352
00:13:30.94 --> 00:13:33.850
surprise surprise the latest polls

353
00:13:32.5 --> 00:13:35.740
actually indicate that he is slightly

354
00:13:33.85 --> 00:13:38.050
more popular than will mean the pent

355
00:13:35.74 --> 00:13:45.160
with over 25 percent would be expected

356
00:13:38.05 --> 00:13:47.320
both and all of this despite being an

357
00:13:45.16 --> 00:13:48.970
independent so here's a high chance of

358
00:13:47.32 --> 00:13:50.590
being the person that the pen will face

359
00:13:48.97 --> 00:13:54.340
in the second round

360
00:13:50.59 --> 00:13:54.340

361
00:13:55.679 --> 00:14:01.899
or maybe not because there is a last

362
00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:02.889
variable that we must consider and that

363
00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:04.869
abstention

364
00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:07.119
even if micron has a lot of supporters

365
00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:09.069
but they are simply not as motivated as

366
00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:10.959
those from the left-hand side so for

367
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:12.849
example if during the second round the

368
00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:14.559
National Front could retain 90 percent

369
00:14:12.849 --> 00:14:16.809
of their votes and macron could only

370
00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:18.399
retain 40 or 50 percent he would have

371
00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:20.819
some great difficulty winning the

372
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:20.819
presidency

373
00:14:23.62 --> 00:14:27.430
but I mean this is just our opinion of

374
00:14:25.69 --> 00:14:29.200
visual politic and we would love to hear

375
00:14:27.43 --> 00:14:31.300
yours do you think the chrome can beat

376
00:14:29.2 --> 00:14:32.710
the pen in front are there any other

377
00:14:31.3 --> 00:14:34.750

378
00:14:32.71 --> 00:14:36.310
