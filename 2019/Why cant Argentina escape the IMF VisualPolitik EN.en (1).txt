14
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,890
recently taken a course on better email

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,630
management my inbox was getting pretty

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,520
out of control and as in really nice

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,290
attack alert so I went on Skillshare I

18
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,120
found something to sort me out and now

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
I've got an actual system in place for

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,570
dealing with emails rather than just

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,399
having the train wreck that I had

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,170
previously that course is called email

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,030
productivity works smarter with your

24
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,039
inbox it's by someone called Alexandre

25
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,850
Samuel and I recommend checking it out

26
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,469
so yes Skillshare just go do it you can

27
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,030
get two months for free and after that

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,890
it's just $10 a month which is

29
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,510
incredibly affordable especially when

30
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,059
compared to pricey in-person courses and

31
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,830
workshops Sport visual politik by

32
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,780
supporting Skillshare that would be

33
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,590
great link below and let's get into it

34
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,130
[Applause]

35
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,020
[Music]

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,040
dear viewers in this video we're going

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,210
to talk about a very special

38
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,160
relationship so special that it's close

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,320
to reaching its 70th anniversary yes

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,280
love has finally come to visual politic

41
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,770
but hold on a second do you think we're

42
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,510
just talking about two ordinary lovers

43
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,550
though not at all a protagonist love

44
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,170
each other and they also hate each other

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,000
they need each other they also despise

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,440
each other I'm talking about the

47
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,570
connection between Argentina and the

48
00:01:42,570 --> 00:02:14,340
International Monetary Fund fondo

49
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,540
monetary or international so the origin

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,280
points promise themselves over and over

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,140
again that they won't go back to the IMF

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,910
but then just a few years later the

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,680
relationship picks up again where it

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,410
left off frente Tanoa situatio de Manila

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,450
prevent IVA a decision easier

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,250
conversation al fondo monetary

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,090
international to give you an idea since

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,310
the mid-1950s Argentina has had to

59
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,770
negotiate an IMF rescue package roughly

60
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,320
every four and a half years so why on

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,300
earth does Argentina keep having this

62
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,489
recurring dependence on the IMF whose

63
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,500
fault is it can this relationship ever

64
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,230
be finalized well let's investigate but

65
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,380
first we need to know how it all began

66
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,660
[Music]

67
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,400
the origin of a toxic love in 1946 the

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,290
International Monetary Fund emerged as

69
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,760
an offshoot of the Bretton Woods

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,950
agreements of 1944 back then world war

71
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,200
ii had just ended europe was shattered

72
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,060
and the Western Allies were preparing to

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,950
face economic consequences and the

74
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,840
demands of reconstruction at that time

75
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
the idea in everyone's minds was to

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,650
avoid what had happened after World War

77
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,020
one that is to accelerate recovery and

78
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,660
avoid the emergence of crises that could

79
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,520
tip some countries towards radical

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,080
movements or even nudge them into the

81
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,120
Soviet orbit with that in mind and with

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,010
the Marshall Plan three institutions

83
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,320
emerged from Bretton Woods to achieve

84
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,600
this goal these institutions are still

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,340
with us today first the IMF or

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,200
International Monetary Fund's would act

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,270
as a last resort lender for countries

88
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,190
with strong fiscal imbalances or

89
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,350
currency crises in other words the IMF

90
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,210
would provide the necessary resources so

91
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,380
that these countries could develop

92
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,420
reforms with which to correct their

93
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,220
imbalances secondly what we know of

94
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,440
today as the World Bank was created as

95
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,120
in order to be in charge of offering

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,250
loans with low interest rates and long

97
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,260
loan repayment periods to help countries

98
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,270
finance their reconstruction and

99
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,550
encourage large investment projects the

100
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,220
third one was gas the general agreement

101
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,620
on tariffs and trade the prelude to what

102
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,880
is now the World Trade Organization

103
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,760
which was born precisely to promote free

104
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,390
trade

105
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,669
thus favored economic growth

106
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,050
although it may be hard to believe today

107
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,270
at that time Argentina had some of the

108
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,099
best economic conditions on the planet

109
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,960
which is why it was invited to be a

110
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,180
founding member of the IMF from the

111
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:47,330
outset however hon Domingo perón who had

112
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,710
just been elected presidents of

113
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,419
Argentina was not the man for the job

114
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:51,949
let's just say that he had a very

115
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:54,169
different model in mind for Argentina

116
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,090
one which had nothing to do with this

117
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,129
kind of large-scale economic integration

118
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,199
by the way I'll leave a link in the

119
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,120
description to a video all about Juan

120
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,370
Domingo perón and the changes he made in

121
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,830
Argentina so you can check that out

122
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,560
however things soon changed in 1955

123
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,050
Peron was overthrown by a military coup

124
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,699
d'etat by then the country's economic

125
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,889
situation was already quite different

126
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:20,900
they at high inflation rates high public

127
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,789
deficits and no foreign exchange

128
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,469
reserves all of this led to factor

129
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:27,080
president Pedro agencia our Amuro to

130
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,780
join the IMF and request aid of almost 1

131
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,910
billion dollars in today's money

132
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,940
and with that the romance had begun and

133
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,740
around the same time Argentina had

134
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,330
already started to look more like the

135
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,910
Argentine we know today but hold on a

136
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,740
second some of you might be wondering

137
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,620
well how how does it work does the IMF

138
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,960
just give money like that do you ask for

139
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,520
a loan with more favorable conditions

140
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,100
and it's just done and dusted is it an

141
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,590
NGO perhaps something like that well no

142
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,260
not exactly

143
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,060
you see the IMF grants financing with

144
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,920
very favorable conditions but also

145
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,020
imposes conditions that it sees as

146
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,030
necessary to correct the problems in

147
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,860
order to eventually recover the money

148
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,490
that was granted of course no country is

149
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,620
obliged to ask for or accept their help

150
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,360
in fact some countries have refused to

151
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,580
work with this agency in the past but if

152
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,890
you do accept their money and conditions

153
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,260
then you have to fulfill said conditions

154
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,160
right

155
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,410
well the truth is that in argentina's

156
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,360
case the broken promises came pretty

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:44,110
quick same old story

158
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,430
when'll torah from DZ took over as

159
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,860
president in 1958 just two years after

160
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,050
Argentina's first bailout the country

161
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,800
again asked the IMF for help on that

162
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
occasion the I lapse condition was that

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,430
in exchange for receiving the money

164
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,200
Argentina would have to push through a

165
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,300
significant cut in public spending and

166
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,160
eliminate import price controls and

167
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,110
restrictions then once they received the

168
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,210
money well let's just say the adjustment

169
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,810
plan was never fulfilled in fact the

170
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,430
following governments that of Arturo

171
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,740
Umberto Elia decided to distance itself

172
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,060
completely from the funds

173
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,340
recommendations and of course things did

174
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:32,110
not improve quite the opposite in fact

175
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,540
after another military coup in 1966 on

176
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,060
this occasion at by hon Carlos on ganya

177
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,950
the country once again fell into the

178
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,720
hands of the IMF this time the

179
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,580
international organizations conditions

180
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,380
were harsh and yet the Argentine

181
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,150
government still never corrected its

182
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,970
imbalances so much so that between 1966

183
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,940
and 1973 the Argentine external debt

184
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,520
grew by 50% or up to four point eight

185
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,440
billion which would be almost the

186
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,390
equivalent of 30 billion dollars today

187
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,370
as you can see the events don't differ

188
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,410
much from what we've seen in Argentina

189
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,540
in recent years but this was still just

190
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,190
the beginning of the romance

191
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,710
[Applause]

192
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,729
you're not sure when I really love out

193
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,389
of beat pika another time for a lot of

194
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:20,639
big in three years later in 1975 there

195
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,349
was another military coup this time led

196
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:24,630
by General Jorge Rafael Videla at the

197
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,849
time the economy was once again broken

198
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,650
down to give you an idea the country was

199
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,090
coming from an economic crisis that

200
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,339
resulted in the so called road ragazzo a

201
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,529
brutal devaluation of the currency by a

202
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,330
hundred percent on the dollar which not

203
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,399
only caused huge inflation but also a

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,959
shortage of many types of products and

205
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,610
given those circumstances what do you

206
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,770
think the new military government did by

207
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,839
exactly they ran straight back to the

208
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,670
arms of the IMF in fact videos

209
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,110
governments maintained very close

210
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,209
relations with this organization and a

211
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,920
large torrent of money flowed into

212
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,899
Argentina from the fund and yes we

213
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,220
already told you before on visual

214
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,440
politics during that time Washington saw

215
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,420
any dictatorships that didn't commune

216
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,250
with the Soviet bloc in a positive light

217
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,350
no matter how criminal it was surely

218
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,970
that influenced the huge amount of money

219
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,500
that the IMF poured into Argentina the

220
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,120
surprising fact is that vidhya's

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,890
government actually did manage to meet

222
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,630
the imf's requirements regarding

223
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,700
economic stabilization what they didn't

224
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,020
manage to do was cut public spending

225
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,240
which is why fiscal imbalances and the

226
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,820
demand for funds continued

227
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,110
by the way in a future video here on

228
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,670
visual politic we're going to talk long

229
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,430
and hard about the policies that the IMF

230
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,650
and the fund itself promulgated and know

231
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,990
the IMF isn't an NGO not at all it is a

232
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,730
lender that lends under favorable

233
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,890
conditions but it's also a lender that

234
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,960
intends to recover its money during the

235
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,220
dictatorship and just seven years

236
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,800
Argentina's external debt multiplied by

237
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,900
six reaching the astounding figure of

238
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,570
forty two billion dollars at the time it

239
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,000
was obvious that the country was broke

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,680
and to top it off this period under

241
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,510
military rule ended with the Falcons

242
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,700
disaster this happens just when they

243
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:22,350
thought things couldn't get any worse

244
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,300
often that last blow that was returned

245
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,580
to democracy when Ralph Olson came to

246
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,530
power on December the 10th 1983

247
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,260
democracy came with many expectations

248
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,930
its democracy you eat heal and educate

249
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,870
yourself are foreseen unfortunately even

250
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,760
this straightforward prophecy was never

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,100
fulfilled but let's stay on track after

252
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,960
reaching power alphonse and rejected the

253
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,850
fund even announcing an audit on the

254
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,470
debt that the military government had

255
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,750
contracted a gesture of sovereignty can

256
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,160
you guess what happens two years later

257
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,860
in 1985 under a colossal mountain of

258
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,660
debt and rising inflation they are

259
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,490
forcing government once again and asked

260
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,080
the fund for help you know how it goes I

261
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,060
love you I love you not and so on and so

262
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,890
on such a sweet story

263
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,290
once again the INF set conditions but

264
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,779
once again the promises remained just

265
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,120
promises that is how offenses mandate

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,070
ended in a complete disaster with a

267
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,380
runaway crisis and rising hyperinflation

268
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,350
to give you an idea in 1989 inflation

269
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,880
was over 2000 percent

270
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,110
[Music]

271
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,480
[Applause]

272
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,430
[Music]

273
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,470
and then came a brand-new President

274
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,050
Carlos Menem and with him came more help

275
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,470
from the IMF the Brady plan a plan that

276
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,390
forced Argentina to restructure its

277
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,160
external debt privatize the Social

278
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,900
Security system privatized public

279
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,880
companies eliminate taxes on financial

280
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,710
transactions and create a new currency

281
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,480
tied to the dollar to avoid the

282
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,320
country's endemic inflation many things

283
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,820
were done during my name's time

284
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,800
especially during his first term and

285
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,690
what's more I actually worked but he

286
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,970
still didn't do the most difficult thing

287
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,360
of all

288
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,190
he didn't adjust public spending in

289
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,930
facts he did quite the contrary under

290
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,520
this president's mandate public spending

291
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,470
continued to grow and with it the

292
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,210
government's external desk check this

293
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:20,100
out that is how men ins presidency ended

294
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,930
with another huge crisis that paved the

295
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,910
way for the famous default of December

296
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,400
2001 just months after the IMF granted

297
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,840
the government of Menem successor

298
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,330
fernando de la rúa a mega rescue package

299
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,220
of 40 billion dollars known as a

300
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,020
financial armoring there was the

301
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,660
definitive default of 2001 the AMA had

302
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,410
lasted only ten months

303
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,000
and after that came a new crisis that

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,610
pushed poverty in Argentina to above 50%

305
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,190
of the population as you can see every

306
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,650
IMF bailout has ended in a resounding

307
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,480
failure and it's become normal

308
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,490
the IMF can give a lifeline to a country

309
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,370
so long as it balances its accounts but

310
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,020
even if it doesn't the result will

311
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,970
always be the same and in Argentina many

312
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,500
things have been done except for really

313
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,480
opening up the economy and cutting

314
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,100
public spending there's also the issue

315
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,720
of the size of the state which is

316
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,570
absolutely gigantic once an example well

317
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,160
check out this graph that we've shown

318
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
you on previous occasions it's truly

319
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,710
truly scary and do not think that this

320
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,660
has been a good deal for the IMF not at

321
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,150
all Argentina has been an example of

322
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,610
this organizations incapacity it has

323
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,830
been a source of constant humiliation

324
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,230
because Argentine politicians accepted

325
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,060
the money but never corrected the

326
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,370
problems and so with such a mess and

327
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,890
this a lack of reliability nothing was

328
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,370
working

329
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,500
nothing could work but then what happens

330
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,120
with koechner ISM they never sought

331
00:13:47,120 --> 00:14:00,950
funding from the IMF so why did the

332
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,440
president

333
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,240
the Kerch nurse the coach nurse didn't

334
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,610
ask the IMF for help that's true but

335
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,670
their story does of a catch you see

336
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,160
after the 2001 default Argentina never

337
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,139
paid most of its nominal debt which led

338
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,000
to a restructuring that eased the

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,920
pressure on public accounts to this we

340
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,360
need to add that during most of

341
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,889
Kirchner's years the price of soybeans

342
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,139
and natural resources which the country

343
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,810
exports were sky-high that means a huge

344
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,550
influx of dollars so the current

345
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,959
government had some wiggle room to

346
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,519
continue expanding public spending

347
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,810
without having to resort to the IMF the

348
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,040
problem was that those conditions didn't

349
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,870
last when the price of soybeans and

350
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,670
other raw materials fell the usual

351
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,379
government problems returned as well as

352
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,420
price controls exchange controls and

353
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,370
restrictions of all times that was

354
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,319
precisely what led Macri to the Casa

355
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,709
Rosada

356
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,060
but with Macri things didn't change

357
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,889
either public spending continued to

358
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,660
skyrocket and the promise of gradual

359
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,639
change was so gradual that most of the

360
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,069
reforms simply never came the oxygen ran

361
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,170
out and with it the Argentine economies

362
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,930
autonomy so in May 2018 the government

363
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,790
requested a new rescue package from the

364
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,980
IMF in this case it amounted to more

365
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,520
than 50 billion dollars

366
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,640
and so the cycle starts again the IMF

367
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,649
sets conditions and Argentine

368
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,779
politicians don't want to comply with

369
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:25,089
them crisis grows so politicians use the

370
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,540
IMF as a scapegoat

371
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,100
then they reject the international body

372
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,910
and the hatred stage begins and finally

373
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,830
they go running back into its arms it's

374
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,510
a neverending story since the 50s

375
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,459
Argentina has requested a rescue from

376
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,589
the IMF roughly every four and a half

377
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:47,830
years and none of the rescues have ever

378
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,260
worked isn't it time maybe for a change

379
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,630
isn't it time for Argentine politicians

380
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,910
to understand that the country needs

381
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,890
this change isn't it time for the IMF to

382
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,630
understand that it has never really

383
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,640
helped Argentina because it has dragged

384
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,010
out a scenario that is just leading the

385
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,529
country from bad to worse so what do you

386
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,850
