00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,370
Middle East is located at the crossroads

deal of international trade passes and

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,690
it's the heartland of one of the biggest

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,800
place that has traditionally been a

31
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,840
hornet's nest and in recent years this

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,130
penchant for drama has only increased

33
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,420
the truth is that today you would be

34
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,550
hard-pressed to find a more conflictive

35
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,590

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,440
conflicts between Israel and Palestine

38
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,330
in recent years we could add the war in

39
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,400
Syria and the war in Yemen to the list

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,930

00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,180
Islamic state caused when its leader Abu

42
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,280
Bakr al-baghdadi declared the

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,290
restoration of the Caliphate and invaded

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,650
much of Iraq and Syria but it doesn't

60
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,539
very important change that has slowly

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,060
begun in the Middle East

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,310
you see in recent decades the great

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,500
American Empire has had a very strong

65
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,450
hand in controlling the region but now

66
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,340
silently and without attracting

67
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,380
attention things are beginning to shift

68
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,840
and all because another Empire is on the

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,260
scene

70
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,700

control of the Middle East using very

the arrival of the eastern empire

75
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,570
in 2016 the Chinese government published

76
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,580
the Arab policy paper its first

77
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,290

Middle East here on visual politic we've

79
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,880
been telling you for a long time how the

80
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,800
Chinese government is slowly unfurling

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
its tentacles across the entire planet

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,530
what we've also told you that the growth

83
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,090
of the Chinese economy is slowing down

84
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,860
which is forced China to curb its

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,570
investments abroad business happens

86
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,610
elsewhere in the world except for one

87
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,290
place the Middle East and there's a very

88
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,140
good reason for this right here on

89
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,550
YouTube you can find very interesting

90
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,040
documentaries such as how Nazi Germany

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
was forced to invest huge amounts of its

92
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,330
resources to produce synthetic oil from

93
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,010
coal and right there was Germany's

94
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,930
Achilles heel the lack of fuel without

95
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,850
energy there can be no power there can

96
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,220
be no prosperity and in a way that's a

97
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,440
modern problem - China is the second

98
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,510
biggest consumer of oil right behind the

99
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,010
United States the difference is that

100
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,230
China are unlike the US or even Russia

101
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,570
has increasingly had to import more and

102
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:51,950
more oil to meet its needs

103
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,290
to give you an idea today half of the

104
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,270
oil that China consumes comes from the

105
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,320
Middle East

106
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,430
[Music]

107
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,500
and it's not just oil the exact same

108
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,379
thing happens with natural gas in 2019

109
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,909
China will become the world's largest

110
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,220
natural gas importer across the globe

111
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,470
China accounts for 1/3 of the world's

112
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,569
natural gas demands and things are

113
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,220
expected to become even worse in the

114
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,259
future you see the Chinese economy is an

115
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,479
economy that has been built on coal want

116
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,940
to hear a curious fact since 2011 China

117
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,070
consumes more coal than all other

118
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,040
countries in the world put together

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,470
[Music]

120
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,600
the problem as you all know is that coal

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,730
is a tremendously polluting energy

122
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,860
source and this not only impacts climate

123
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,630
change but also the quality of life and

124
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,770
health of Chinese citizens some days

125
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,840
these cities seem to have been built

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
inside of a fireplace that's precisely

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,190
why the government is pushing to replace

128
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,600
this energy source with cleaner

129
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
alternatives renewable energies nuclear

130
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,940
energy and natural gas in other words

131
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,970
China's energy dependence is and will be

132
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,190
one of this country's biggest weaknesses

133
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,140
so you can already see how important it

134
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,850
is for the Chinese government to control

135
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,400
and guarantee its oil and natural gas

136
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
sources if supply to these resources

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,420
were impeded all the power and

138
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,220
prosperity of the Asian giant would

139
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,840
collapse when the Chinese government

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,150
debates national security they have to

141
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,110
talk about energy

142
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,390
[Music]

143
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,070
and there's also one other very

144
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,200
important detail China isn't the only

145
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,120
Asian nation that depends on energy

146
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,280
supplies without delving too deep to of

147
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,110
its neighbors and greater rivals have

148
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,430
even higher dependence levels

149
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,560
in japan's case their dependence on

150
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,870
Middle Eastern oil exceeds 90% of its

151
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,540
consumption and in India's case 60% let

152
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,490
me explain this another way controlling

153
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,139
a hydrocarbon sources could not only be

154
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,479
useful to China from the security of

155
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,340
supply point of view but also as a

156
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,180
geopolitical instruments and of course

157
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,130
when all this depends largely on a

158
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,259
region riddled with so many problems

159
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,970
well let's just say that Beijing

160
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,979
understood it was high time to get a

161
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,900
foothold in the Middle East even more so

162
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,310
if we consider that the country with the

163
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,020
most influence over this region right

164
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,030
now is its biggest rival in the United

165
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,520
States

166
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,319
[Music]

167
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,210
but that's not the only reason there's

168
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,009
another reason that explains China's

169
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,199
growing interest in the petro monarchies

170
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,599
region ensuring the safety of their

171
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,550
trade routes as you know that Chinese

172
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,889
economy is very focused on exports well

173
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,080
a substantial part of all Chinese trade

174
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,759
passes directly through the Middle East

175
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,740
and in order for trade to flow China

176
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,289
depends on both the ports and the so

177
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,249
called choke points in that area

178
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,050
these are critical points in many supply

179
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,819
chains and if arrivals such as the

180
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,740
United States were able to close them it

181
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,629
would interrupt most of China's trade

182
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,580
both inbound and outbound we're talking

183
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,199
about places such as the Suez Canal that

184
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,389
meant it straight or almost straight and

185
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,639
keep in mind that these are waters full

186
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,029
of American naval ships

187
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,349
why now this scenario doesn't seem

188
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,270
likely but it's a risk that the Chinese

189
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,279
authorities are already considering for

190
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,839
these two reasons the Middle East has

191
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,759
become a level one priority for the

192
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,379
Chinese government but at this point the

193
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,330
question that pops up is well how does

194
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,009
the Chinese government want to do this

195
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:15,719
what is the Chinese government doing to

196
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,690
expand its influence in this region

197
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,210
[Music]

198
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,710
China's power paths in the field of

199
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,870
international politics the strategy that

200
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,819
the Chinese follow to achieve their

201
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,770
objectives is different from what we

202
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,909
used to you see China doesn't want to

203
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,530
gain control in the Middle East by using

204
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,840
its army instead it wants to use a very

205
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,610
different mechanism there's nothing new

206
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,669
they've been doing it all over the world

207
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,110
the Asian giant wants to create a

208
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,870
culture of economic independence one so

209
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,909
strong that it can give China enormous

210
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,629
influence among the region's countries

211
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,710
this is an interdependence that

212
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,440
guarantees full access to and in some

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,080
ways control of all the oil and natural

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,210
gas they need this explains why China

215
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,099
has positioned itself as the largest

216
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,069
investor in the region since 2017 that's

217
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,349
even above the United States itself one

218
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:17,060
out of every three euros that are

219
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,680
invested in the Middle East come from

220
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,570
Chinese money

221
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,880
it's the only region in which Chinese

222
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,590
foreign investment continues to grow

223
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,480
steadily for example in 2016 the Chinese

224
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,400
company Sina packin to the Saudi company

225
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,500
Aramco agreed to jointly build a

226
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,540
refinery worth more than ten billion

227
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,580
dollars in Saudi Arabia in Kuwait

228
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,800
Sinopec has also participated in the

229
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,630
construction of the largest refinery in

230
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,880
the world a project worth more than 13

231
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,090
billion dollars and in a man quick

232
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,860
question have you ever heard of Dharam

233
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,780
well keep this name in mine because it's

234
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,610
likely to become very well known very

235
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,260
soon dokkum is a new city and port that

236
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,210
is shooting up in a part of a man where

237
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,100
there was just hardly anything about

238
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,780
five years ago today it's one of the

239
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,580
largest special economic zones in the

240
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,260
entire Middle East and is here that

241
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,150
Chinese companies are investing billions

242
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,310
of dollars refineries ports airports

243
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,410
hotels offices business campuses we're

244
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,610
talking about a completely new

245
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,860
industrial city located at the gates of

246
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,570
the Houmas straight that is Chinese

247
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,920
shipping companies can operate without

248
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,900
having to enter the Persian Gulf and is

249
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,610
not only a haven for shipping companies

250
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,080
among the billion dollar Chinese

251
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,240
investments there are factories of all

252
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,850
kinds

253
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,399
these are only three examples of the

254
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,499
huge investments China is pouring into

255
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,689
this area of the world back in 2008 the

256
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:41,789
region received belly 1% of all the

257
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,529
money that China invested globally today

258
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,600
there is Chinese money all over the

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,499
Middle East but the Chinese don't only

260
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,149
invest their money they also have no

261
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:53,100
problem selling all kinds of technology

262
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,019
to these countries especially military

263
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,949
technology for example many of the

264
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,720
military drones and ballistic missiles

265
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,100
that are operated in the region of

266
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,839
Chinese made and all this comes at

267
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,429
precisely the same time as the other

268
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,319
great power the American Empire is

269
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,179
radically changing its strategy for the

270
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:21,389
Middle East the escape route after

271
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,129
investing hundreds of billions of

272
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,229
dollars and paying a huge price in human

273
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:27,269
lives the United States seems to be done

274
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,769
with the Middle East especially now that

275
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,779
they're about to achieve full energy

276
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,989
independence between 2004 and 2007 the

277
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,970
United States imported about 12 million

278
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,249
barrels per day but this figure has

279
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,189
decreased to just over 2 million by 2017

280
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:46,079
that is oil imports have decreased by

281
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,029
80% what's more according to the

282
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,829
International Energy Agency it will only

283
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,539
be a matter of a few years until the

284
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:53,609
United States becomes a net exporter of

285
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,289
oil and natural gas it's set to become

286
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,329
quite the competitor to the Gulf petro

287
00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:03,449
monarchies while the situation is that

288
00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:05,249
the Obama administration had already

289
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,529
announced its intention to decrease the

290
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,239
United States's presence in the Middle

291
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,069
East and to prioritize the asia-pacific

292
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,139
region meanwhile one of Donald Trump's

293
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,850
greatest promises and along the same

294
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,079
lines

295
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,689
does the USA want to be the policeman of

296
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,699
the Middle East getting nothing but

297
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,920
spending precious lives and trillions of

298
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,110
dollars protecting others who in almost

299
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,269
all cases do not appreciate what we are

300
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,860
doing do we want to be there forever

301
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,220
time for others to finally fight Donald

302
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,129
Trump to achieve this the Trump

303
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,139
administration has a plan to delegate

304
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,269
power to leave the responsibility in the

305
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,369
hands of two close allies and military

306
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:46,779
leader and a political leader I'm

307
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,110
talking about Israel and Saudi Arabia

308
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,490
[Music]

309
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,230
that explains why since Trump arrived at

310
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,550
the White House his relations with

311
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,499
Riyadh and Jerusalem have become very

312
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,899
very good Saudi Arabia has been willing

313
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,069
to allow it and to forgive everything a

314
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:06,970
blockade against the country where the

315
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,860
United States has its largest military

316
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,499
base in the region go ahead Donald Trump

317
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,629
tweet support for blockade imposed on

318
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,429
Qatar Congress wants to veto the sale of

319
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:16,899
weapons to Saudi Arabia's that they

320
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,279
won't use them in the Yemen war will be

321
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,410
having none of us Donald Trump vetoes

322
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,449
bills prohibiting arms sales to Saudi

323
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,220
Arabia the Saudi authorities kill a

324
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,540
journalist who worked for The Washington

325
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,240
Post hi well let's just look the other

326
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,429
way shall we

327
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:32,199
Trump defends Saudi Arabia ties despite

328
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,360
Khashoggi murder Riyadh is asking you to

329
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,100
take care of the air defense problem

330
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,369
it's all US to send more forces to Saudi

331
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,259
Arabia despite Trump's pledge to reduce

332
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,070
middle-east presence

333
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,490
but the big question is well why well

334
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,690
that's because it would be a great

335
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,430
political success for Trump to get out

336
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,230
of the Middle East and to foster a peace

337
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,360
agreement between Israel and Palestine

338
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,970
which all American president since Jimmy

339
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,949
Carter have tried to do but hold on a

340
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,690
minute because what does Palestine have

341
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,250
to do with any of this well it looks

342
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,779
like the Trump administration wants to

343
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,399
present a peace agreement before the

344
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,230
next elections a peace agreements that

345
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,089
for the first time could be backed by

346
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,769
the neighboring Arab countries which

347
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,569
would force the Palestinian authorities

348
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:16,360
to accept it that at least is Trump's

349
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,730
idea anyway as you can see some want to

350
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,860
hop off and others want to hop on two

351
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,630
different models to control one of the

352
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,699
most strategically important regions on

353
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,529
the planet the questions remaining are

354
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:31,300
will Trump's model to control the Middle

355
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,579
East work or will it end up being locked

356
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,740
out of an emergent Chinese domain will

357
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,690
all these actions from the big powers be

358
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,370
good for the region stability or will

359
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,860
they only add fuel to the fire of old

360
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,899
conflicts well leave your answer in the
