00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
welcome to Kashmir want to escape from

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,019
the stress of the city here you'll find

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,360
beautiful valleys breathtaking nature

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,250
ancient culture Wars terrorist attacks

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,500
and systematic violence

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,930
yes Kashmir is the last place on earth

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,939
you'd want to go and in the last few

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,740
months this region situated between

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,170
India and Pakistan has been making news

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,700
headlines again could it lead to nuclear

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,620
war well in this video we're going to

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,070
explore that possibility

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,620
[Applause]

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,870
[Music]

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,730
there are only three sporting events

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,440
that gather an audience of more than a

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,660
billion people worldwide the opening of

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,880
an Olympic Games a FIFA World Cup final

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,730
and an india-pakistan cricket tornavoz

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,930
[Applause]

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,730
heard that right cricket is the national

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,770
sport in both India and Pakistan two of

23
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,540
the most populated countries on the

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,820
planet and the rivalry between them it

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,729
goes way beyond sports Kashmir suffers

26
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,700
from the worst attack in 30 years and

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,500
believe me this is no small matter both

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,810
India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,369
the main reason for their fighting is a

30
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,979
region called Kashmir both countries are

31
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,590
in dispute over control of this area so

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,570
in February 2000 and 19 a terrorist

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,060
group called JC Mohammed organized one

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,800
of the worst terrorist attacks in

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,810
Kashmir pan India answered this with the

36
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,550
first bombing in sunny Pakistani

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,399
territory in decades the situation it

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,040
really could have been more tense

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,450
so the questions are we about to witness

40
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,360
a nuclear war why do India and Pakistan

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,640
hate each other so much well today we're

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,080
going to answer those questions and

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
we're going to do it with the help of

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,620
our friend Xander Schneider a political

45
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,390
analyst in one of the voices from the

46
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,100
reconsider media podcast you'll often

47
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,400
hear about on these videos hey Simon and

48
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,320
flow to all of you visual politics

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,060
subscribers out there as you mentioned

50
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,280
India and Pakistan are in a standoff of

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,230
sorts and really have been since they

52
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,570
became independent countries

53
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,660
[Music]

54
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,310
today we're gonna talk a lot about

55
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,350
nuclear weapons but more importantly

56
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,030
we're going to talk about nuclear

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,430
doctrine can all of this lead to nuclear

58
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,650
war I don't think so in this video we're

59
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,360
gonna discuss why well we get too bored

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,950
of that but before we do let's take a

61
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:39,900
look back at the history of the Titans

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,850
after World War two all of the Indian

63
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,560
territories became independent from the

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,840
British Empire but there was a bit of a

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,940
problem there were two big religious

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,950
groups here Muslims on the one hands and

67
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,230
Hindus on the other so what did the UK

68
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,970
do well easy they sent all of the

69
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,890
Muslims to one blazes and they called

70
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,540
that Pakistan and they send all of the

71
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,190
Hindus to another and they called that

72
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,990
India but there was still one problem

73
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,460
there were many areas where it wasn't

74
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,050
clear if there was a Muslim or a Hindu

75
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,660
majority in Kashmir or well it was one

76
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,670
of those regions basically most of the

77
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,740
Kashmir citizens were Muslim but their

78
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,750
governor their Maharaja

79
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,060
happens to be Indian this is why the

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,190
British decided that Kashmir would be an

81
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,770
independent nation which made everyone

82
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,530
happy right

83
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,180
no in fact quite the opposite just two

84
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,890
months after Kashmir declared its

85
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,680
independence Pakistan invaded it so the

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,980
Maharaja asked India for help

87
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,110
this is how these two brand-new states

88
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,780
India and Pakistan started a war the

89
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,580
results cite from thousands dead and

90
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,879
millions displaced is that 1949 Kashmir

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
was divided into two parts one for India

92
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,709
and one for Pakistan but if you thought

93
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,540
that a border was going to be enough to

94
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,400
keep everyone happy think again

95
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,349
India and Pakistan would go on to fight

96
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:03,930
three more wars over control of this

97
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,209
whole territory now wars between India

98
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,130
and Pakistan tend to follow a similar

99
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,200
pattern Pakistan start for the wars and

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,269
India wins them and after all at the end

101
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,220
of the day India is a more powerful

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,070
country as a larger population a larger

103
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,900
military and more money so we've already

104
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,940
reached the 1960s in our timeline here

105
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,620
back then the Indian Prime Minister was

106
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,300
the woman were picturing here Indira

107
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,710
Gandhi

108
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,000
and there are two things that you should

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,220
know about her first she had no familial

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,110
connection whatsoever to Mahatma Gandhi

111
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,090
and the second is that she had nothing

112
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,460
to do with peace and non-violence

113
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,380
basically we're talking about a woman

114
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,570
who forced six million poor people to

115
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,790
yeah vasectomies so this woman the noid

116
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,530
as she was by the Pakistani attacks

117
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,360
essentially said this we're getting

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,270
some nuclear bombs and therefore in 1967

119
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,180
India started its nuclear program

120
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,680
[Music]

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,630
since then the Pakistani army hasn't

122
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,490
dared to directly attack it's now

123
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,410
nuclear neighbor instead Kashmiri

124
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,639
citizens have been suffering

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,710
never-ending attacks from all kinds of

126
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,840
Pakistani terrorist groups and if

127
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,520
terrorism wasn't enough the Indian

128
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,169
government does not around either

129
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,510
since 1990 Kashmir has been under

130
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,229
martial law

131
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,000
this means the constant repression of

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,440
its citizens and if you thought the

133
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,729
situation couldn't get any more

134
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,430
complicated is that really possible yes

135
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,229
because in 1998 things took an

136
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:24,540
unexpected turn let's have a look at

137
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,720
that

138
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,280
standoff fighting a nuclear country is

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,979
like playing cricket without bats that

140
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,810
is why even leave Pakistan is poorer

141
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,360
than India Zola Kivar Ali Bhutto who was

142
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,370
the president of Pakistan back then had

143
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,080
a very clear goal the grass or leaves

144
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,169
even go hungry but we will get one of

145
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,110
our own news Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto this is

146
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,690
now in the year 1998 Pakistan conducted

147
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,750
its first nuclear tests Pakistan has

148
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,580
been obliged to exercise the nuclear

149
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,789
option due to weaponization of India's

150
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,219
nuclear program this has led to the

151
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:08,150
collapse of the existential deterrence

152
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,990
and had radically altered the strategic

153
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,330
balance in our region and this is how we

154
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,490
get to the Mexican standoff a Mexican

155
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,169
standoff as a situation when none of the

156
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,629
participants have any way of winning so

157
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:22,400
they're basically waiting for someone to

158
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,199
make a false move but even though both

159
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,150
India and Pakistan now have nuclear

160
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,129
bombs there is one area where they

161
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,129
differ then nuclear doctrines India has

162
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,469
a no first use doctrine this means they

163
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,240
are ready to make use of their nukes

164
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,800
only if they've been attacked by the

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
same kind of weapons

166
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,630
[Music]

167
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,540
[Applause]

168
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,880
Pakistan's nuclear doctrine is different

169
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,130
it does allow for first use of nuclear

170
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,410
weapons if they are invaded with a

171
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,330
sufficiently large ground force in this

172
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,160
doctrine tactical weapons play a very

173
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,900
important role you see when it comes to

174
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,430
nuclear weapons there are two high-level

175
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,950
categories of strategic nuclear weapons

176
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,870
and tactical ones strategic nuclear

177
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,060
weapons are those that can take out an

178
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,250
entire city and are usually launched

179
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,990
from thousands of miles away on a

180
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,330
ballistic missile or dropped from a

181
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,070
strategic bomber tactical nuclear

182
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,140
weapons on the other hand are smaller

183
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,240
yield and meant to be used on a

184
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,700
battlefield and close proximity to

185
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,670
maneuvering forces this January Pakistan

186
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,950
tested a short-range ballistic missile

187
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,170
equipped to carry tactical nuclear

188
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,000
warheads although this is definitely not

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,030
the first nuclear delivery vehicle that

190
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:34,639
Pakistan has in its arsenal

191
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
dan equips military with tactical loop

192
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,810
capable missile in other words Pakistan

193
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,849
is compensating for its smaller military

194
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:46,169
might with a more aggressive nuclear

195
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:48,180
doctrine if India attacks them they

196
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,979
could use the tactical weapons easily

197
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,319
and even destroy the nuclear silos on

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,909
Indian territory and if you think this

199
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,800
is a very irresponsible nuclear doctrine

200
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,349
for a country well hold on a second

201
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,500
because you haven't seen anything yes in

202
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,210
Pakistan the nuclear button is not in

203
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,219
the government's hands but rather it's

204
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,870
in the Army's in this country the

205
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,190
military in the government there go

206
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,050
rather different ways and the Pakistani

207
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,000
army is really quite scary

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,199
basically there are many reasons to

209
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,849
believe that the Army is supporting

210
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:20,699
several terrorist organizations and this

211
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,730
explains news like this

212
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,130
was military to cancel three hundred

213
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,110
million dollars in Pakistan aid over

214
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,970
terror groups for example you might

215
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,040
remember a chap called Osama bin Laden

216
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,090
remember where he was when he was

217
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,850
finally found well yes that was in

218
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,720
Pakistan

219
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,730
more specifically next to the cackled

220
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,919
military academy which is sort of the

221
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,020
Pakistani equivalent of West Point and

222
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,670
what types of terrorist organizations

223
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,040
might allegedly be connected to the

224
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,260
Pakistani military well on one hand you

225
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,780
have groups that support the Taliban in

226
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,300
Afghanistan for example on the other we

227
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,580
have groups like Josh and Muhammad which

228
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,010
fight to gain control of Kashmir so no

229
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,930
matter how hard the Pakistani government

230
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,300
tries to cut ties with New Delhi both

231
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,220
the Pakistani army and the terrorists

232
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,010
they make those plans backfire and well

233
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,810
how does India respond to all of this

234
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,970
that's basically by improving their

235
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,590
nuclear arsenal and what do you do when

236
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,970
your rival neighbor knows where you have

237
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,860
all your nuclear silos well we're gonna

238
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:25,790
tell you right now can you imagine

239
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,290
someone like John Elway the legendary

240
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,850
sportsman becoming the American

241
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,980
presidents well this is exactly what

242
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,480
happened to Pakistan their new president

243
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
is Imran Khan the man who led his

244
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,440
country to victory in the Cricket World

245
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,830
Cup

246
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,110
just like his predecessors Imran Khan

247
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,540
has tried to improve relations between

248
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,330
India and Pakistan and this is when Josh

249
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,160
and Mohammad organized one of the worst

250
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,800
massacres in Kashmir in recent memory

251
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,060
and this is when Narendra Modi

252
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,310
essentially said something like this

253
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,230
hey Pakistan Pakistan come over there

254
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,850
come over here we're having a lottery

255
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,850
and the prize is a punch in the face and

256
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,620
you've got all the tickets

257
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,399
[Music]

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,839
in other words for the first time in

259
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,660
decades the Indian Army bombed Pakistani

260
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,550
territory this means they didn't attack

261
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,350
the Pakistani part of Kashmir but

262
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,170
Pakistan itself but hold on a second

263
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,930
because this is not the end of our story

264
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,160
remember that Mexican standoff situation

265
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,000
well India has made a hell of a move and

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,100
this move has a name the I earnest

267
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,029
arahant

268
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:33,540
these so-called enemies destructor your

269
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,420
submarine I&S our ahan completes patrol

270
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,940
country's nuclear triad operational

271
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,920
remember I told you that Pakistan could

272
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,540
use their strategic weapons to destroy

273
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,329
Indian nuclear silos well the Indians

274
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:46,829
were aware of this and that's why they

275
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,600
got nuclear submarine the advantage of a

276
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,980
nuclear submarine is that you can have

277
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,050
your nuclear arsenal constantly moving

278
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,209
around underwater it's harder to find

279
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,010
and therefore it's harder to destroy and

280
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,529
this is why the Pakistani army is so

281
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,149
nervous and this is the point where the

282
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,010
media started talking about a would-be

283
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,740
nuclear war but is this really likely

284
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,600
well we have a visual politic we don't

285
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,850
really think so why well first of all

286
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,010
even though India attacked Pakistan they

287
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,690
just bombed some terrorist training

288
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,610
camps this means they didn't actually

289
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,950
cross any red lines that Pakistan would

290
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,630
consider an invasion so what was this

291
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,399
llama buds response to all of this well

292
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,560
some air strikes but let's be honest

293
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,820
they're the last country to want a

294
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,200
nuclear war just have a look called the

295
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,660
former Pakistani president said

296
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,060
[Music]

297
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,759
attack with one nuke India may finish us

298
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,129
with twenty atavism of Schroth

299
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,990
this explains why Pakistan didn't wait

300
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,850
any longer than three days to release

301
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,769
the Indian pilot that they captured and

302
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,120
in case they were tempted at some point

303
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,189
to strike back India has made things

304
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,530
very very clear

305
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,210
[Music]

306
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,800
Navy deploys aircraft carrier and

307
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,529
nuclear subs to deter misadventures by

308
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,960
Pakistan so again so far it seems like

309
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,460
neither country is really thinking about

310
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,610
an actual nuclear war so then well who

311
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,290
is this all really helping well so far

312
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,390
the clearest winner is Narendra Modi the

313
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,760
Indian Prime Minister yes dear viewers

314
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,680
India is celebrating a presidential

315
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,210
election and all this conflict with

316
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,490
Pakistan has helped Modi rise up in the

317
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,180
polls all the clears victory in Indian

318
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,160
elections as a position Congress party

319
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,020
concedes but don't worry because in the

320
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,550
following weeks we'll talk about the

321
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,680

ever be friends can this conflict get

332
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,730
