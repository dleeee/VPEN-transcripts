21st 2016 Vandy 51% of Bolivians

56
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,060
rejected the modification of article 168

57
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,190
of the Constitution in a referendum this

58
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,140
constitution which clearly prohibits the

59
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,760
re-election of an individual for more

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,560

this situation with a constitution that

67
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,320
you yourself approved and that is so

68
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,270
clearly laid out and having lost a

69
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,010
referendum to modify it you'd probably

70
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,440
say okay I respect the rules and other

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,390
candidates should probably run for my

72
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,310
party at least that's what happens you

73
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,560
know in a country with a sort of minimal

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,850
respect for the rule of law

75
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,350

government has power over all the

79
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,120

80

public good

81
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,550

82
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,450

Constitutional Court published grotesque

86
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,430
0:08 4 / 2017 a judgments by which

87
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,440
articles of the Constitution itself were

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,599
declared unconstitutional which included

89
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,420
article 168 therefore allowing for

90
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,180
indefinite re-elections how well yeah

91
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,799
let's just say welcome to Evo Morales's

92
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:47,870
Bolivia the fact is the Constitutional

93
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,610
Court's controversial decision was a

94
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,190
huge blow to Bolivia's rule of law in

95
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,720
the end it didn't matter what the

96
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,940
Constitution sand or what the Bolivians

97
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,799
themselves voted for the only thing that

98
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,319
mattered was what Evo Morales wanted and

99
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,390
faced with this situation large numbers

100
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,190
of Bolivian society took to the streets

101
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,920
to protest under the cry of Bolivia said

102
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:16,669
no but here's another question do you

103
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,979
think this affected even Morales at all

104
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:20,989
did it make him rethink his position or

105
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,820
try to reach an understanding with most

106
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,370
of Bolivia society who had voted against

107
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,950
his re-election well no obviously not

108
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,289
Evo made it clear that all he wants is

109
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,700

time the government had played fair and

114
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,970
they lost the referendum so they made

115
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,530
sure that when the time came they

116
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,569
wouldn't lose at the polls again and do

117
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,400

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,060
see article 167 of the Bolivian

191
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,950
Constitution states that the candidate

192
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,780
who gets 50% of the votes would be

193
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,760
declared presidents alternatively if a

194
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,680
candidate gets more than 40% of the vote

195
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,420
with ten points ahead of the candidate

196
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,340
with the second-highest votes he or she

197
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,590
can also be declared presidents if these

198
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,930
conditions aren't met a second round

199
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,120
must be held a second rounds in which

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,130
given the results victory wasn't quite

201
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:13,880
so certain very very Alice however we've

202
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,710
already told you that Evo wasn't willing

203
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,170
to lose power and what's more he had a

204
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,390
plan the following day and after more

205
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,980
than seventeen hours of unexplained

206
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,990
suspended coverage a fast preliminary

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,640
results transmission jumps from

208
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,990
eighty-three percent to ninety five

209
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,060
percent only to be suspended again until

210
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,180
finally five five days later a hundred

211
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,800
percent of the official vote count was

212
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,839
reached

213
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,229
and surprise surprise the results were

214
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,909
suddenly very different there was to be

215
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,980
no second rounds because Evo had beat

216
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,470
his rival by more than 10 points ends

217
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,710
well that's when everything kicked off

218
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,750
thousands and thousands of citizens

219
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,700
began to amass in front of the Electoral

220
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,820
Tribunal and suspicion of fraud ran wild

221
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,550
no survey no Paul nor any statistical

222
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,500
program had foreseen such a vote

223
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,570
deviation a deviation at the ends of the

224
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,399
counter that was completely opaque ins

225
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,440
happens amid serious irregularities in

226
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,370

230
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,680
this is what led to protests throughout

231
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,660
the country protests that fundamentally

232
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,209
demanded one thing clean elections as

233
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,620
you can imagine the government's first

234
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,180
reaction was to try and stifle the

235
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,040
protests through repression using the

236
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,019
state security forces and while that was

237
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,089
that far from seeking a solution to the

238
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:48,069
problem what Evo did was denounce an

239
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:50,230
alleged coup against him against him a

240
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,420
president who didn't hesitate to ignore

241
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,370
his own constitution and deploy all

242
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,680

okay so some of you might now be

246
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,230
thinking well okay Simon but I mean

247
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,480
really was the fraud the electoral

248
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,030
robbery was it really so blatant well to

249
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:15,600
be quite frank yes

250
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,040
practically all the independent players

251
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,080
agree on this for example international

252
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,300
organizations that acted as observers

253
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,650
during the elections such as the

254
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,510
European Union or the Organization of

255
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,640
American States have recommended holding

256
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,230
a second round because the official

257
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,810
results just can't be accepted every

258
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,430
election must be governed by the

259
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,670
principles of certainty legality

260
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,290
transparency fairness independence and

261
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,360
impartiality the mission was able to

262
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,340
verify that several of these principles

263
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,170
have been violated through different

264
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,840
paths throughout this electoral process

265
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,240
report from the Organization of American

266
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,120
States observers and that's not all even

267
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,190
civil society members spotted a lot of

268
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,020
irregularities for example there's the

269
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,820
case of computer systems engineer Edgar

270
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,530
Villa Grasse who along with the team of

271
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,660
professionals has worked on comparing

272
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,580
the official calculation tables with the

273
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,760
results transmission his conclusion was

274
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,590
that the process was full of traps which

275
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,300
included the elimination of voting

276
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,530
results tables to favor

277
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,230
mas Evo Morales party and there's more

278
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,630
check this out Bolivia the official

279
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,180
audit described the elections as quote

280
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,670
null and void and Carlos Mesa demanded

281
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,560
new elections the company hired by the

282
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,140
Supreme Electoral Tribunal delivered a

283
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,940
report stating that it cannot quote

284
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,370
attest to the integrity the results end

285
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,740
quote of the presidential elections held

286
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,410
last 20th of October as you can see not

287
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,180
even the companies that the Electoral

288
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,730
Tribunal itself hired which has a fully

289
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,130
backed Evo in the past dares to validate

290
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,930
the results the fraud is just too

291
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,850
evidence

292
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,800
and finally the Organization of American

293
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,260
States observers preliminary report was

294
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,570
very much in the same vein fraud deceit

295
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,330
scams and mockery of the public will all

296
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,029
of this was evidence Evo Morales wanted

297
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,980
to become leader just like his friends

298
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,680
nicolas maduro and Daniel Ortega who as

299
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,020
you all know are experts in ignoring the

300
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:27,209
democratic process anyone who's been

301
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:29,010
following Bolivia's political news knows

302
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,350
one thing Evo Morales was going to stay

303
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,089
in power no matter what however the

304
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:34,950
street protesters didn't want to see Evo

305
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,020
become a new Nicolas Maduro and the

306
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,089
bumbling and scandalous way in which he

307
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,130
tried to perpetrate electoral robbery

308
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,560
meant his shot backfired the police

309
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,420
began to mutiny so they wouldn't have to

310
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,770
comply with the government's repression

311
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,480
orders and that along with the mass

312
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,070

organize and stand for election again

321
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,080

without the people without the police

333
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,319
without the army even Morales was forced

00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:44,120
to hand in his resignation and resign

report rising protests but just a second

338
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,440
because the drama doesn't end there this

339
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,440
is what followed Evo Morales travels to

340
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,690
Mexico on a plane owned by the Lopez

341
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,050
Obrador government and so that's how Eva

342
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,180
Morales is time in Bolivia came to an

343
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,560
end after his departure the new

344
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,089
transition government has announced a

345
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,649
call for new elections elections that

346
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,240
will be supervised by international

347
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,819
organizations now fine the procedure may

348
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,259
not have been the best but Bolivian

349
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,120
democracy was at stake Evo would have

350
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,069
had to leave but he got drunk with power

351
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,199
and decided to turn Bolivia into his own

352
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,970
personal playgrounds of course it

353
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,589
doesn't in there Olivia now faces not

354
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,480
only a deep institutional conflicts but

355
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,670
also significant economic imbalances

356
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,829
Evos most recent years were really bad

357
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,569
and the future is far from clear the

358
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,310
