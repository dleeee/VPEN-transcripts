3
00:00:06.66 --> 00:00:11.499
comes approach towards Russia has been

4
00:00:09.19 --> 00:00:13.389
one of the most controversial parts of

5
00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.889
its short time in office so far it seems

6
00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.110
that the u.s. president wants to develop

7
00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.180
a new friendship with this old rival the

8
00:00:17.11 --> 00:00:21.610
thing is that this isn't proving so easy

9
00:00:19.18 --> 00:00:23.770
and that's because Beijing is standing

10
00:00:21.61 --> 00:00:25.510
between them Russia who's in Moscow

11
00:00:23.77 --> 00:00:27.460
without any doubt one of the most

12
00:00:25.51 --> 00:00:29.530
controversial issues is the fascination

13
00:00:27.46 --> 00:00:31.349
Trump seems to have with Russia and its

14
00:00:29.53 --> 00:00:33.670
charismatic leader clavinet whose

15
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.379
insinuations messages of support of the

16
00:00:33.67 --> 00:00:36.910
election of senior officials who were

17
00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.499
close to the Kremlin he is met with

18
00:00:36.91 --> 00:00:41.050
Russian President Vladimir Putin and the

19
00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.960
Kremlin gave him the order of friendship

20
00:00:41.05 --> 00:00:46.059
in 2013 the new administration the way

21
00:00:43.96 --> 00:00:48.159
to speak shade right now it is

22
00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.569
absolutely a gift for huijin he couldn't

23
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.249
have dreamed about anything like that

24
00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.649
just three months ago the question

25
00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.539
really is is Trump trying to seduce the

26
00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.089
Russian leadership or as some are saying

27
00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.069
is there something suspicious about this

28
00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.389
developing relationship it would be fair

29
00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.639
to say the Trump approach to Russia

30
00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.170
could have an explanation according to

31
00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.090
some analysts advisors in the White

32
00:01:05.17 --> 00:01:09.399
House may have told Trump to try to be

33
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:11.439
remembered and make history by being the

34
00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.930
leader who has the same success with

35
00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.920
Russia as Nixon and Kissinger as with

36
00:01:13.93 --> 00:01:20.210
China

37
00:01:15.92 --> 00:01:22.880
Nixon said notice Mao's China on the

38
00:01:20.21 --> 00:01:25.340
21st of February 1972 one of the most

39
00:01:22.88 --> 00:01:26.149
important events in decades took place

40
00:01:25.34 --> 00:01:28.850
that say

41
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.830
Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing it was

42
00:01:28.85 --> 00:01:33.190
the first-ever business you've communist

43
00:01:30.83 --> 00:01:37.040
China by a US president

44
00:01:33.19 --> 00:01:40.550
[Music]

45
00:01:37.04 --> 00:01:42.950
big step for Nixon unknown step of

46
00:01:40.55 --> 00:01:45.590
mankind the entire trip was broadcast

47
00:01:42.95 --> 00:01:46.340
around the world and it was major major

48
00:01:45.59 --> 00:01:48.020
news

49
00:01:46.34 --> 00:01:50.210
millions of people held their breaths as

50
00:01:48.02 --> 00:01:52.280
they saw Nixon descending the stairs of

51
00:01:50.21 --> 00:01:55.640
Air Force One and setting foot in the

52
00:01:52.28 --> 00:01:59.840
Chinese capital city generations in the

53
00:01:55.64 --> 00:02:02.390
years ahead look there and thank us for

54
00:01:59.84 --> 00:02:05.060
this meeting that we are all in this

55
00:02:02.39 --> 00:02:07.160
past week but before we continue let's

56
00:02:05.06 --> 00:02:09.229
actually go back of it and see what this

57
00:02:07.16 --> 00:02:11.390
visit really meant what are the goals of

58
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.800
this visit and what made it possible so

59
00:02:11.39 --> 00:02:15.800
we're going to travel back in time to

60
00:02:12.8 --> 00:02:17.810
October the 1st 1949 this was the day

61
00:02:15.8 --> 00:02:20.060
that China was declared I think People's

62
00:02:17.81 --> 00:02:22.280
Republic of China the Communists led by

63
00:02:20.06 --> 00:02:24.590
Mao had won the Chinese Civil War and

64
00:02:22.28 --> 00:02:27.110
they took power of this new country this

65
00:02:24.59 --> 00:02:29.660
new regime was completely hostile to

66
00:02:27.11 --> 00:02:31.280
Washington DC in fact only a year later

67
00:02:29.66 --> 00:02:33.830
troops of the Chinese army participated

68
00:02:31.28 --> 00:02:35.870
in the Korean War to support Pyongyang's

69
00:02:33.83 --> 00:02:38.620
regime therefore confronting the u.s.

70
00:02:35.87 --> 00:02:38.620
face to face

71
00:02:40.04 --> 00:02:44.510
as a result of this bitter and violent

72
00:02:42.26 --> 00:02:46.430
fight and did thousands of casualties on

73
00:02:44.51 --> 00:02:48.620
each side there were no intentions of

74
00:02:46.43 --> 00:02:50.269
establishing any diplomatic relations it

75
00:02:48.62 --> 00:02:53.540
would be fair to say that from that time

76
00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.980
on China in the u.s. we're enemies how

77
00:02:53.54 --> 00:03:01.430
these Chinese have to move in this

78
00:02:54.98 --> 00:03:03.680
neighborhood in the meantime though

79
00:03:01.43 --> 00:03:05.690
relations between Beijing and Moscow was

80
00:03:03.68 --> 00:03:07.489
very very different it is true that now

81
00:03:05.69 --> 00:03:09.560
has never got on with the Soviet leaders

82
00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.879
to add by the way supported other people

83
00:03:09.56 --> 00:03:12.620
to be the leader of the Chinese

84
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.480
Communist Party however despite all of

85
00:03:12.62 --> 00:03:16.940
these differences a Russian Chinese

86
00:03:14.48 --> 00:03:18.889
alliance was almost inevitable on the

87
00:03:16.94 --> 00:03:21.139
one hand the Soviet Union needed to

88
00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.970
control or at least influence the other

89
00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.639
great communist power on the other hand

90
00:03:22.97 --> 00:03:27.799
mouths China desperately needed the USSR

91
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.599
for economic technological as well as

92
00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.849
military support the support was so

93
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.329
generous in fact between the year 1950

94
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.340
formed and 1959 the USSR spent 7 percent

95
00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.500
of the government's resources assisting

96
00:03:37.34 --> 00:03:41.480
China some even say that this was the

97
00:03:39.5 --> 00:03:46.190
largest technological transfer in

98
00:03:41.48 --> 00:03:47.989
history now despite all of this

99
00:03:46.19 --> 00:03:50.209
differences started to emerge in almost

100
00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.650
every part of their relationship and the

101
00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.480
alliance got weaker and weaker

102
00:03:51.65 --> 00:03:55.190
been tilled well it completely broke

103
00:03:53.48 --> 00:03:56.900
apart relations that were getting very

104
00:03:55.19 --> 00:04:00.169
first there was the assault of the

105
00:03:56.9 --> 00:04:01.940
USSR's embassy in Beijing in 1967 and

106
00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.769
then the first armed encounter took

107
00:04:01.94 --> 00:04:05.769
place in 1969

108
00:04:10.78 --> 00:04:15.290
the casualties were numerous during this

109
00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.419
fight and a few days later the Soviets

110
00:04:15.29 --> 00:04:19.250
bombarded Chinese troops deployed in the

111
00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.900
area the conflict didn't go any further

112
00:04:19.25 --> 00:04:22.729
but today's there was a feeling in the

113
00:04:20.9 --> 00:04:24.889
air that this could be the start of a

114
00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.449
significant war Moscow even considered

115
00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.530
sending troops from the Warsaw Pact

116
00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.419
countries which Romania objected to it

117
00:04:30.53 --> 00:04:34.610
is also said that in order to prevent a

118
00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.650
potential nuclear attack by Russia Nixon

119
00:04:34.61 --> 00:04:38.630
contacted Moscow to make it perfectly

120
00:04:36.65 --> 00:04:40.310
clear that the US would never accept

121
00:04:38.63 --> 00:04:50.720
something like that happening under any

122
00:04:40.31 --> 00:04:52.280
circumstances in the end relations

123
00:04:50.72 --> 00:04:54.139
between these two communist nations

124
00:04:52.28 --> 00:04:55.910
broke down completely at the time of

125
00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.550
both Nixon and his famous National

126
00:04:55.91 --> 00:05:00.770
Security Advisor Henry Kissinger decided

127
00:04:58.55 --> 00:05:05.240
to take a famous saying and to make it

128
00:05:00.77 --> 00:05:07.490
their own the enemy of my enemy is my

129
00:05:05.24 --> 00:05:09.440
friend and once they'd said it they

130
00:05:07.49 --> 00:05:11.690
started to put it into action and two

131
00:05:09.44 --> 00:05:13.669
years later Nixon within Beijing

132
00:05:11.69 --> 00:05:16.389
relations between the USA and China

133
00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:19.039
moved on slowly in fact it wasn't until

134
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.930
1979 with Jimmy Carter in office that

135
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.610
full relations with the nation were

136
00:05:20.93 --> 00:05:25.039
established but the truth is that

137
00:05:22.61 --> 00:05:27.050
Nixon's trip to China made room for a

138
00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.380
period of successful relations between

139
00:05:27.05 --> 00:05:32.000
the two nations in 1972 bilateral trade

140
00:05:30.38 --> 00:05:34.070
between the two nations didn't even

141
00:05:32.0 --> 00:05:39.460
reach a billion dollars today as a

142
00:05:34.07 --> 00:05:39.460
number is close to 600 billion

143
00:05:40.1 --> 00:05:44.210
the relations have been relatively

144
00:05:41.93 --> 00:05:46.280
friendly and the u.s. also made a solid

145
00:05:44.21 --> 00:05:48.700
ally against the Soviet Union during the

146
00:05:46.28 --> 00:05:48.700
Cold War

147
00:05:50.88 --> 00:05:54.360
and lives according to some analysts

148
00:05:52.62 --> 00:05:56.970
this is what Trump is trying to achieve

149
00:05:54.36 --> 00:05:59.550
with Russia to reenact Nixon and

150
00:05:56.97 --> 00:06:01.170
Kissinger strategy for Beijing but with

151
00:05:59.55 --> 00:06:03.030
Moscow this would explain the

152
00:06:01.17 --> 00:06:05.010
pro-russian attitude of the current

153
00:06:03.03 --> 00:06:08.340
president however things are very much

154
00:06:05.01 --> 00:06:11.180
different now than they were in 1969

155
00:06:08.34 --> 00:06:15.530
[Music]

156
00:06:11.18 --> 00:06:17.730
romance between China and Russia

157
00:06:15.53 --> 00:06:19.500
relations between China and Russia have

158
00:06:17.73 --> 00:06:21.480
started to improve since the end of the

159
00:06:19.5 --> 00:06:23.730
1980s with some treaties and agreements

160
00:06:21.48 --> 00:06:25.980
being signed here and there but it all

161
00:06:23.73 --> 00:06:28.470
changed when she Jinping came to power

162
00:06:25.98 --> 00:06:30.750
in 2012 since then relations have

163
00:06:28.47 --> 00:06:33.420
advanced quickly consider what was said

164
00:06:30.75 --> 00:06:36.360
in 2016 by one of the major players in

165
00:06:33.42 --> 00:06:37.950
the Chinese government the profundity

166
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:40.350
and the level of coordination between

167
00:06:37.95 --> 00:06:42.840
both countries has reached a level we

168
00:06:40.35 --> 00:06:44.370
have never seen before and Beijing seems

169
00:06:42.84 --> 00:06:46.620
to be certain about one thing an

170
00:06:44.37 --> 00:06:49.080
alliance between China and Russia would

171
00:06:46.62 --> 00:06:50.640
be very powerful from any perspective

172
00:06:49.08 --> 00:06:54.370
today both countries are cooperating

173
00:06:50.64 --> 00:06:57.770
like they have never cooperated before

174
00:06:54.37 --> 00:07:00.500
[Music]

175
00:06:57.77 --> 00:07:02.810
in 2016 Russia became the first Chinese

176
00:07:00.5 --> 00:07:04.490
oil supplier with oil that arrives by

177
00:07:02.81 --> 00:07:06.229
land this is something incredibly

178
00:07:04.49 --> 00:07:07.970
important for China because in the case

179
00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.160
of the conflict the US would be unable

180
00:07:07.97 --> 00:07:14.289
to block the oil arriving something it

181
00:07:10.16 --> 00:07:14.289
could do if that oil is arriving by sea

182
00:07:15.18 --> 00:07:24.300
[Music]

183
00:07:21.71 --> 00:07:26.010
also in both countries have started to

184
00:07:24.3 --> 00:07:28.169
conduct a joint military exercises

185
00:07:26.01 --> 00:07:29.790
they've also created economic and

186
00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.229
technological bonds and have agreed to

187
00:07:29.79 --> 00:07:33.270
carry out projects to build

188
00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.610
infrastructure which will connect both

189
00:07:33.27 --> 00:07:36.930
countries so how about some examples of

190
00:07:35.61 --> 00:07:42.240
this well let's have a look at three

191
00:07:36.93 --> 00:07:44.160
first the military exercises Russia and

192
00:07:42.24 --> 00:07:46.139
China have begun eight days of naval

193
00:07:44.16 --> 00:07:53.150
drills in the South China Sea second

194
00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:55.470
those economic embalming and third

195
00:07:53.15 --> 00:07:58.590
infrastructure and for this one what

196
00:07:55.47 --> 00:08:00.810
better example bidder than this after 28

197
00:07:58.59 --> 00:08:02.729
years of talks construction has finally

198
00:08:00.81 --> 00:08:05.330
started on a bridge between China and

199
00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:05.330
Russia

200
00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:12.279
us there is more these two countries

201
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:13.839
have signed important military

202
00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:15.819
agreements China has committed to

203
00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:17.499
spending billions of dollars to buy some

204
00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:19.749
of the most modern equipment that the

205
00:08:17.499 --> 00:08:21.759
Russian army has such as the s400

206
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.439
service to air missile and the most

207
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:26.169
impressive weapon in the Russian

208
00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:27.819
Arsenal's the Sukhoi 35 fighter aircraft

209
00:08:26.169 --> 00:08:30.749
just have a look at this incredible

210
00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:30.749
machine

211
00:08:36.32 --> 00:08:40.940
services there are also many economic

212
00:08:38.87 --> 00:08:42.740
political men's monetary agreements all

213
00:08:40.94 --> 00:08:48.529
of this has led to quite a lot of

214
00:08:42.74 --> 00:08:52.040
concern in the United States west to the

215
00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:53.329
tiniest Russian are heard now just

216
00:08:52.04 --> 00:08:54.769
suppose that for just a second before

217
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:57.440
you start to get scared because

218
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:59.149
everything isn't quite as idyllic as it

219
00:08:57.44 --> 00:09:00.860
sounds both powers may have come

220
00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:03.019
together but there are still many

221
00:09:00.86 --> 00:09:04.880
elements that separate them for might

222
00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:06.620
potentially weaken this unity for one

223
00:09:04.88 --> 00:09:08.690
China wants to be important and

224
00:09:06.62 --> 00:09:10.759
influential in international politics

225
00:09:08.69 --> 00:09:12.380
and that implies becoming the leader of

226
00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:14.630
Central Asia this is something that

227
00:09:12.38 --> 00:09:16.310
Russia certainly doesn't want in their

228
00:09:14.63 --> 00:09:18.620
view the ex-soviet States in the region

229
00:09:16.31 --> 00:09:20.209
has to remain under the influence of

230
00:09:18.62 --> 00:09:22.339
Moscow further there are issues

231
00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:24.500
concerning their economic relations in

232
00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:26.149
trade is unbalanced in favor of Russia

233
00:09:24.5 --> 00:09:28.069
Russia has become a supplier of natural

234
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.750
resources to China for the last few

235
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:32.209
years while China has been supplying

236
00:09:29.75 --> 00:09:33.500
Russia with Chinese manufactured goods

237
00:09:32.209 --> 00:09:35.000
which are more valuable

238
00:09:33.5 --> 00:09:37.130
you see China's position towards

239
00:09:35.0 --> 00:09:38.990
international trade is very pragmatic

240
00:09:37.13 --> 00:09:40.610
Chinese people want to make money so

241
00:09:38.99 --> 00:09:42.620
they know it's good for them to open

242
00:09:40.61 --> 00:09:46.630
their markets to the world this is

243
00:09:42.62 --> 00:09:49.040
simply an idea that Russia doesn't share

244
00:09:46.63 --> 00:09:51.170
and then there is the issue with some of

245
00:09:49.04 --> 00:09:53.120
Russia's partners like India Russia is

246
00:09:51.17 --> 00:09:55.610
the largest weapons supplier in India

247
00:09:53.12 --> 00:09:57.260
and obviously Beijing doesn't like that

248
00:09:55.61 --> 00:09:59.880
at all

249
00:09:57.26 --> 00:10:01.980
so even though these two countries are

250
00:09:59.88 --> 00:10:04.020
trying to get closer and are supporting

251
00:10:01.98 --> 00:10:06.180
each other against the u.s. we shouldn't

252
00:10:04.02 --> 00:10:08.460
expect a very solid relationship between

253
00:10:06.18 --> 00:10:09.960
them after all China is eventually going

254
00:10:08.46 --> 00:10:12.060
to make a play to become the leader in

255
00:10:09.96 --> 00:10:16.100
this relationship and Russia isn't just

256
00:10:12.06 --> 00:10:19.950
going to lie down and accept that this

257
00:10:16.1 --> 00:10:21.570
transplants beautiful worms they be

258
00:10:19.95 --> 00:10:24.060
honest it doesn't seem very likely that

259
00:10:21.57 --> 00:10:25.920
reenacting Nixon's strategy is possible

260
00:10:24.06 --> 00:10:28.560
this is largely because China is going

261
00:10:25.92 --> 00:10:30.270
to strongly oppose this relationship but

262
00:10:28.56 --> 00:10:31.800
despite this if from once you earn the

263
00:10:30.27 --> 00:10:33.360
trust of Moscow he will have to make

264
00:10:31.8 --> 00:10:36.950
some concessions which would be

265
00:10:33.36 --> 00:10:36.950
difficult to accept in Washington

266
00:10:37.79 --> 00:10:42.000
elimination of sanctions giving in on

267
00:10:39.96 --> 00:10:44.070
the Ukraine and Syria the end of the

268
00:10:42.0 --> 00:10:46.230
anti-missile shield among others Putin

269
00:10:44.07 --> 00:10:47.790
is very demanding and even if a good

270
00:10:46.23 --> 00:10:50.340
relationship is established between

271
00:10:47.79 --> 00:10:52.080
Russia and the United States it is not

272
00:10:50.34 --> 00:10:53.850
clear whether this alliance would be

273
00:10:52.08 --> 00:10:55.770
very effective as actually stopping

274
00:10:53.85 --> 00:10:57.600
China this is one reason why Obama

275
00:10:55.77 --> 00:10:59.400
preferred a strategy of surrounding

276
00:10:57.6 --> 00:11:01.170
China by reaching agreements with the

277
00:10:59.4 --> 00:11:03.570
countries neighbours India Vietnam

278
00:11:01.17 --> 00:11:05.700
Malaysia and in this strategy the TPP

279
00:11:03.57 --> 00:11:06.990
was key and I say was of course because

280
00:11:05.7 --> 00:11:08.520
it was one of the first things that

281
00:11:06.99 --> 00:11:10.320
Trump's blocked when he arrived in the

282
00:11:08.52 --> 00:11:11.880
White House only time is going to be

283
00:11:10.32 --> 00:11:14.160
able to tell where the Trump strategy is

284
00:11:11.88 --> 00:11:15.660
going to work out for right now it's not

285
00:11:14.16 --> 00:11:17.430
looking very promising so that's our

286
00:11:15.66 --> 00:11:18.870
opinion here at visual politic and we

287
00:11:17.43 --> 00:11:20.550
would now love to know what you think do

288
00:11:18.87 --> 00:11:22.500
you think a Chinese Russian alliance is

289
00:11:20.55 --> 00:11:24.000
going to be consolidated against the USA

290
00:11:22.5 --> 00:11:26.010
what do you think Trump will succeed in

291
00:11:24.0 --> 00:11:28.260
a mix and light relationship with Moscow

292
00:11:26.01 --> 00:11:30.120
