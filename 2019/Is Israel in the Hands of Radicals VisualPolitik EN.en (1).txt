know what I am I'm a nationalist okay

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,529
politicians from the most extreme

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,020
radical and populist right-wing parties

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,760
are enjoying a bit of a boom time at the

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,710
moment the United States Brazil Hungary

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,930
Italy these are just a few examples and

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,660
it seems that Spain is also heading down

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:52,890
that same path much but others it was

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,970
throw a de chelly no clothes watches the

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,379
characteristics of the various group

19
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,000
they differ by country but the mix of

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,250
populist policies with authoritarian and

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,140
xenophobic undertones is something that

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,460
they generally all seemed to share

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,440
there's one country however where due to

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,270
its history we really wouldn't expect

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,399
this type of movement to gain any

26
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:15,990
grounds I'm of course talking about

27
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,550
Israel and let me tell you that the

28
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,140
changes we've already seen there are

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,220
quite striking

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,740
[Applause]

31
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,610
[Music]

32
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,110
Israel 70 years of history have shown us

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,940
how a state created along socialist

34
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,120
lines has taken a 180 degree turn on

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:44,280
pretty much every level it's gone from

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,110
being the land of agrarian kibbutz to a

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,270
paradise for technology startups it's

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,190
gone from being an eminently secular

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,480
state to a place where religion has

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,610
gained a force in state affairs and has

41
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,560
gone from being a nation dominated by

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,229
bipartisanship to a fragmented political

43
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,300
scene in which the liquids right-wing

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,990
almost always wins want a babysitter de

45
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,360
belem BBC gets me a stack of collage

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,929
even though a national for him that

47
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,620
energy XANA luckily we have an

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,830
incredibly critical election I want your

49
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,530
support and I think it's important for

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,300
the future of the country

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,610
[Music]

52
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,959
you see Israel has a parliamentary

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,599
system and more importantly it has a

54
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,909
single constituency this encourages

55
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,379
political leaders to create their own

56
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,420
parties anywhere in the state which has

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,250
led to a very fragmented Parliament

58
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,959
drove of the 12 tribes of Israel that

59
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,670
were so widely spoken of in the Bible

60
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,709
well one more tribe one less that's the

61
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:45,209
number of political forces in the

62
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,250
Knesset the Israeli Parliament the

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,079
Knesset is important for every Israeli

64
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,810
citizen because the laws passed here and

65
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,079
decisions taken effect directly every

66
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,260
one of us this extreme fragmentation has

67
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,879
led to what is already almost a

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,519
tradition in Israeli politics coalition

69
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,260
governments with so many parties in the

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,849
chamber agreements between multiple

71
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,739
forces to shape the various governments

72
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,689
for inevitable this makes negotiations

73
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,239
complex and lengthily and governments it

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,859
makes them quite unstable lalalalala

75
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,370
hovering enmity occupy lowly flay law

76
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,780
hurray will obeisance love and I forgot

77
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,390
me

78
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,420
[Applause]

79
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,210
this is well-known by one protagonist in

80
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,400
particular Benjamin Netanyahu who's

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,170
aiming to run for his fourth consecutive

82
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,360
term in the next elections he's an

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,640
expert in pacts and coalitions these are

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,230
tactics and strategies that have kept

85
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,209
him in power which have also driven him

86
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,400
more and more to the political right so

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,430
listen up can you imagine how hard it is

88
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:56,410
to stop Ronaldo from scoring the goal

89
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,320
Basu thank you listen his rules not on

90
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:06,050
but it's indestructible now

91
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,050
Phoebe the leader

92
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,600
the reputation of Netanyahu v political

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,580
leader who has transformed Israel has

94
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,560
been marred and his future it seems

95
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,140
uncertain Israel's Attorney General has

96
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,300
announced his intention to indict Prime

97
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,460
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges

98
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,220
of bribery fraud and breach of trust

99
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,660
endangering mr. Netanyahu's political

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,190
future but this is not the first time

101
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,780
he's been accused dear viewer if milli

102
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,330
has learned anything it's how to escape

103
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:49,800
unscathed from political problems also

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,730
if you want to get to know this

105
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,170
character just a little bit better do

106
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,850
check out our video on him he's a

107
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,530
politician but he's not just any

108
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,720
politician his biography is what you

109
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,670
would expect from the protagonist of a

110
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,890
best-selling political fiction novel and

111
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,470
side note Netanyahu himself shared a

112
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,000
part of that video on his own Facebook

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,980
page are you kidding me we'll leave the

114
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,330
link in the description below and also

115
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,720
at the end of this video but let's go

116
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,850
back ten years ago after the fall of the

117
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,560
government that was led by a hood old

118
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,420
nurse who incidentally was later

119
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,100
convicted of corruption he was at this

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,960
point but Netanyahu returned to power

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,480
and this is where our story begins I

122
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,960
should read Lee I came to see you did

123
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:44,190
you say just to see not to talk

124
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,260
see at that time right-wing parties were

125
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,390
the majority but still maybe managed to

126
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,100
gain the support of a divided Labor

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,820
Party what followed were four years of

128
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,200
stable governments in which the only

129
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,090
thing Netanyahu couldn't move forward on

130
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,710
were his lost budgets then in the

131
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,050
following elections in 2013 Netanyahu

132
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,570
won and on that occasion a coalition was

133
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,820
formed with center parties excluding any

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,710
extremist religious groups however this

135
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,660
understanding it only lasted for two

136
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,260
years

137
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,420
what camera members go to pub in the

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,210
coudÃ© Levada a harissa cannot emit it

139
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,730
should believe me the bougie also via

140
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,400
sham inshallah by introducing the heart

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
out of you the problem at the time

142
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,790
wasn't the economy Netanyahu came to

143
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,960
power in the midst of the global

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
economic crisis but with him at the helm

145
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,500
things have generally gone pretty well

146
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,540
in terms of economics here you can see

147
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,460
how Israel's GDP has evolved compared to

148
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,560
that of the United States or Germany on

149
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,570
the flip side things in Gaza have gotten

150
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,920
worse than ever

151
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,290
with Hamas that's why the coalition with

152
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,760
the tender parties fell apart and

153
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,500
Netanyahu's leadership was once again

154
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,810
left for the polls to decide in 2015 and

155
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,730
it was precisely during this period that

156
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,350
a good chunk of Benjamin Netanyahu's

157
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,820
government's became markedly more

158
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,190
right-wing you see although there be won

159
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,260
the elections again he had no choice but

160
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,090
to form a coalition with five parties

161
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,130
ranging from the center rights to the

162
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,500
ultra-orthodox Jewish extremists one of

163
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,850
his coalition partners was a super

164
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,169
conservative political party that

165
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:11,880
doesn't even accept women into their

166
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,980
ranks yep you heard that correctly that

167
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,430
is happening in 21st century Israel

168
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,230
[Music]

169
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,240
the factors this Prime Minister has been

170
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
changing his travel companions based on

171
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,750
his needs in order to form a government

172
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,180
how did this tax you but all right you

173
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,950
might now be thinking well come on Simon

174
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,080
this does happen to a lot of governments

175
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,300
and besides Netanyahu has always been a

176
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,040
right-wing leader and you know his

177
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,480
results they've kind of been generally

178
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,340
pretty good so what is it that has set

179
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,140
off alarm bells and why isn't it in

180
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,000
Yahoo suddenly being accused of plotting

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,710
what many claim is the most radical

182
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,960
government in the history of Israel well

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:08:00,240
listen to this the Jewish law friends

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
the ultra-orthodox movement is becoming

185
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,440
extremely popular the Haredi as they're

186
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,170
known they are growing and growing and

187
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,570
you might be wondering well you know

188
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,520
what's the big deal well because most

189
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,410
ultra-orthodox Jewish families they're

190
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,090
dependent on state aid due to the fact

191
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,100
that half of all harity men don't work

192
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,300
instead they dedicate themselves

193
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,370
exclusively to studying the Torah for

194
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,410
them there's nothing more important than

195
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,020
studying these sacred texts the ones who

196
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,760
do work in these families are women that

197
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,710
under very particular conditions they

198
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,210
have to do so in places that have

199
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,979
separate work places for men and women

200
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,840
the dining room it must serve kosher

201
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,760
food and they must respect the Sabbath

202
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
but that's not all the burden of

203
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,210
managing the home and the family it also

204
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,010
falls on women and we're talking about

205
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,600
pretty large families here on average

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,790
there are around seven children or to

207
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,200
these families so with the strict

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,760
conditions needed before they can even

209
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,770
consider a job or to study coupled with

210
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,420
their extensive duties taking care of

211
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,130
their homes and families the available

212
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,110
jobs are beauty very limited and

213
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,820
precarious you can see why most

214
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,800
ultra-orthodox families live off state

215
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,080
aid instead and on top of that with so

216
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,060
many children the Haredi population is

217
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,560
booming the number of ultra-orthodox

218
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,540
Jews in Israel has surpassed 1 million

219
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,610
people for the first time in by 2065

220
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,320
they're expected to represent one-third

221
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,690
of the country's total population

[Music]

223
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,379
in other words the ultra-orthodox are

224
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:29,149
becoming more and more numerous and

225
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,829
therefore becoming more significance

226
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,930
from a political and electoral point of

227
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,759
view so the question is or what is

228
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,120
Netanyahu done about all of this

229
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:47,450
[Music]

230
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,160
well here's where it gets curious when

231
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
he was ariel sharon's Minister of

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,610
Finance he drastically cuts subsidies to

233
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,900
the yesh of alts the ultra-orthodox

234
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,420
school for rabbis however a decade later

235
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,830
when he needed the Haredi parties to

236
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,150
form a government as you can probably

237
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,890
guess what happens

238
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,170
[Music]

239
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,959
yeshivah budget hits all-time high after

240
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,149
Israel approves new increase we're

241
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,560
talking about money being used to fund

242
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,970
more than a hundred thousand altra

243
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,290
Orthodox men in order to dedicate

244
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,300
themselves exclusively to studying the

245
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,070
Torah obviously the more money they have

246
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,450
for their religious studies the less

247
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,550
incentive they have to work it was for

248
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,899
precisely this reason that Bibby

249
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,639
defended cutting these subsidies in the

250
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,860
past well folks since Netanyahu has

251
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,600
needed harity political support their

252
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,269
budget has absolutely skyrocketed no

253
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,990
surprise but just hold on a second

254
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,430
because this is basically a drop in the

255
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,230
bucket compared to what we're about to

256
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,780
tell you

257
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:49,860
[Music]

258
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,780
the most controversial measure that

259
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,520
Netanyahu's government has taken has

260
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,740
been the nation law which declares

261
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,660
Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish

262
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,110
people

263
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,820
you see Ezra was founded on the ideal of

264
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,710
religious freedom in fact 40 percent of

265
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,450
Israelis of Jewish origin declare

266
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,190
themselves as non-religious and

267
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,900
non-practicing they're agnostic and they

268
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,580
consider that state affairs must be

269
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,470
completely secular in addition to these

270
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,300
agnostics 20% of the population isn't

271
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,980
Jewish at all but in spite of all of

272
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,900
this the new law declares that only the

273
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,250
Jewish people have the right to

274
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,840
self-determination in the Israeli

275
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,460
territory and the Jewish settlements in

276
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,050
Israel are no less than of national

277
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,910
interest in another visual politic video

278
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,530
we've already discussed what's happening

279
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,820
with these settlements and how they're

280
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,620
now suddenly of national interest but

281
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,030
the nation state law it goes even

282
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,710
further for example it also eliminates

283
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,330
Arabic as the official language in

284
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,830
Israel it establishes the Hebrew

285
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,120
calendar as the state's official

286
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,620
calendar there in short the idea of a

287
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,570
secular and inclusive Israel it doesn't

288
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,970
seem to be going that well to top it all

289
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,260
off the law has been approved for

290
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,850
inclusion into the fundamental laws of

291
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,410
the state a set of laws that have

292
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,820
something equivalent to a nation's

293
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,350
Constitution but what does this all

294
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,210
really mean what it means is that the

295
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,370
law seems to give priority to Israel's

296
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,990
Jewish nature over its Democratic one

298
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,960
today some citizens feel that they're

299
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,490
second-class or that the state has

300
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,020
stopped being secular as you can imagine

301
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,240
the Arab population it certainly hasn't

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
remained silent on the matter Israeli

303
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,190
Arabs challenged nation state law and

304
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,500
top court most extreme principles since

305
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,080
end of apartheid but I mean some of you

306
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,160
are probably thinking right now

307
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,230
yeah but Arabs complaining about Israeli

308
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,140
politics not exactly something new well

309
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,880
that may be so but they're not the only

310
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,330

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,950
this isn't the only area in which

314
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:47,770

National Defense Forces are the most

319
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,590

no one has done more than the army to

guarantee the survival of the Hebrew

324
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,360
state historically her any students were

325
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,070
exempt from the almost three year

326
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,540
compulsory military service in Israel

327
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,190
however there has been a tremendous

328
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,960
judicial battle between the

329
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,030
ultra-orthodox and those who oppose this

330
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,410
preferential treatment and it's been

331
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,940
going on for twenty years and it's

332
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,530
precisely here where the ultra-orthodox

333
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,930
parties have most asserted themselves in

334
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,910
exchange for their support of Netanyahu

335
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,430
they have bashed out new formulas for

336
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,590
exemption and postponement of military

337
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,160
service for the Haredi but folks the

338
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,960
justice system has checked Bibby himself

339
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,730
and now the ultra-orthodox they're up in

340
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,470
arms

341
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,580
Israel's High Court strikes down

342
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,950
exemption of ultra-orthodox from

343
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,050
military service so it seems that in

344
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,760
order to stay in power Netanyahu has

345
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,350
been willing to grant all kinds of

346
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,550
concessions to the ultra-orthodox

347
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,800
parties which has slanted Israel's

348
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,650
policy to levels never seen before in

349
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,170
this state this stevia's is the leaders

350
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,540
dark side remember this is the same man

351
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,130
who as we previously told you was

352
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,500
instrumental in Israel's enormous

353
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,750
economic success the next elections are

354
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,310
going to decide his future which is

355
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,230
bolstered by his good diplomatic track

356
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,090
record with the Arab countries and by

357
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,550
his alliances in Africa and Asia but it

358
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,590
is also precarious due to serious

359
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,270
allegations of corruption

360
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,400
so what can we expect well this is gonna

361
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,230
be a hard one to call but as always when

362
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,580
it does happen we're gonna tell you

363
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,170
about it right here on visual politic so

364
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,700
I hope you enjoyed their video and

365
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,320

privacy well why do you need to do that

369
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,590
well if you shop online a VPN is a great

370
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,210
way to prevent hackers from getting

ahold of your credit card information

372
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,260
