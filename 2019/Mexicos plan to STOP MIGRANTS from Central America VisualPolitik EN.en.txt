[Music]

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,210
let's start with a question and please

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,550
don't cheat and look it up on Google how

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,440
many immigrants have been deported like

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,240
Donald Trump think about during the

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,949
electoral campaign Donald Trump couldn't

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,990
have made his point more clear he

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,210
wouldn't accept any more illegal

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,260
immigrants well check out this chart

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,010
[Music]

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,500
if you pay attention you will see that

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,989
deportations wise Obama was stricter on

14
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,180
immigration than Trump does this mean

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,040
the Trump loves immigrants and deserves

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,940
a Nobel Peace Prize no in fact there are

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,670
many nuances to discuss about that cha

18
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,110
but I wanted to show it to you to make a

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,059
point when it comes to immigration words

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,519
are one thing and facts are a totally

21
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:53,309
different one so why are we talking

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,710
about any of this well that's because of

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,920
this migrants at southern border top

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,750
100,000 for second month in a row yeah

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,030
that right at the moment the American

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,500
continent is dealing with one of the

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,289
biggest refugee crises in recent history

28
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,000
but let's hear more details about this

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
from Eric of course Simon in recent

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,649
years hundreds of thousands of Central

31
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,119
American immigrants have been crossing

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,190
Mexican territory and to reach the

33
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,840
border with the United States many of

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,910
them are children and women who make the

35
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,590
trip by foot and often arrive

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,570
malnourished and sick

37
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,540
and yes I said they cross Mexican soil

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,280
because they come from Central America

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,950
countries such as Hoon Duras Guatemala

40
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,800
and El Salvador from many have become a

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,370
living hell

42
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,710
there's violence or drug gangs and of

43
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,480
course in many places there's a stream

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,340
poverty and these have caused people to

45
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,020
flee their homelands in search of a

46
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,710
better life

47
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,270
so now you're wondering well how did

48
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,120
Trump react to this challenge well of

49
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,190
course he did this Trump threatens

50
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,440
Mexico with five percent import tariffs

51
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,200
over illegal immigration yeah yeah all

52
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,240
right Donald Trump wants to pass the hot

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,340
potato to Mexico but here's the big

54
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,980
question well what does Mexico do about

55
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,780
it first of all the Mexican president is

56
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,030
the man you see on screen right now that

57
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,700
is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also

58
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,310
known as amlo an Lu is a hardcore

59
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,290
left-wing politician who you guessed it

60
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,350
is not a big fan of Donald Trump during

61
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,510
the electoral campaign he said he would

62
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,040
be compassionate with immigrants

63
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,989
crossing into his country but now he

64
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:33,700
says he's being pushed by the White

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,440
House to take a hard stance on

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,250
immigration

67
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,680
[Music]

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,260
Yesi mexico has a lot to lose if America

69
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,049
imposes tariffs on them so and I had to

70
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,579
send in the troops to stop the

71
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,079
immigrants on the southern border so

72
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,510
again evil Donald Trump is pushing a

73
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,700
poor good-hearted politician to do his

74
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,280
dirty work right well this is a

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,280
narrative you often hear on many media

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,189
outlets but is it really that simple

77
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,659
this is a big question I mean what would

78
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,280
be the big deal if Mexico just took in

79
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,209
more refugees

80
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,709
I mean similar arrangements have been

81
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,569
made with other countries like Turkey

82
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:13,000
and they seem to work but here's the

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,739
thing have you ever wondered about the

84
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,560
immigration policy in Mexico well you

85
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,480
should here are some numbers fourteen

86
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,099
percent of the u.s. population are

87
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,500
immigrants vo ECD average is 13 percent

88
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,409
but Mexico has just one percent yep yeah

89
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,930
that right Mexico is not a country for

90
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,939
foreigners so today's question is well

91
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:33,430
how does Mexican immigration policy

92
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,230
actually work what is Mexico actually

93
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,540
doing to manage the refugee crisis are

94
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,209
they really doing what Trump wants well

95
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,560
today we're going to answer all of these

96
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,280
questions but as always before we do we

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,050
got to take a look back at the history

98
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,320
[Music]

99
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,390
the migrant caravan I know what you're

100
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,090
thinking now why are so many Central

101
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,100
Americans leaving their countries right

102
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,930
now well let's be honest here Honduras

103
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,910
Guatemala and El Salvador have not

104
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,860
exactly been history's prosperous

105
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,660
countries but if we have learned

106
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,820
anything from history it's that what can

107
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,660
go bad can go even worse between 2010

108
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,920
and 2012 the crime rates absolutely

109
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,780
skyrocketed Honduras suffered kadar in

110
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,120
2009 El Salvador is suffering street

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,709
violence from the so called morass or

112
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,630
street gangs something similar is

113
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,490
happening in Guatemala as part of it can

114
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,050
be explained the cause of drug

115
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,090
trafficking

116
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,800
[Music]

117
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,289
you see during the 80s narco violence

118
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,349
was focused on Colombia you definitely

119
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:39,449
knew that those were the times of Pablo

120
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,030
Escobar the Cali cartel and bark but

121
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,400
after 2000 Colombia managed to reduce

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,500
the violence yep cocaine production is

123
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,360
still going on there but the cartels

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,300
have reached a sort of Pax maceiÃ³ such

125
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,250
they are still doing the drug business

126
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,080
but they don't kill each other anymore

127
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,360
but now a similar kind of drug violence

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,889
has move to other parts of the

129
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:00,659
continents also some people blame

130
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:02,729
climate change according to this theory

131
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,380
climate change is creating droughts in

132
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,090
Central America if the crops aren't

133
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,159
productive people starve and have to

134
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,949
leave add to this NGOs like pueblos

135
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,080
sinfronteras which organized the

136
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,360
so-called migrant caravans they offer

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,220
logistical support to thousands of

138
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,020
migrants to start their journeys to the

139
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,240
US border but of course it's not only

140
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,150
about NGOs it's also about those human

141
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,190
traffickers

142
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,479
[Music]

143
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,150
so as you can see there are many

144
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,599
explanations but the truth is that there

145
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,449
is an exodus for a better understanding

146
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,529
in 2007 u.s. Border Patrol apprehended

147
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:44,240
16,000 Guatemalans 11 years later in

148
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,610
2018 the figure increased to a hundred

149
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,650
and sixteen thousands and now you might

150
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,749
be wondering well are these immigrants

151
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,900
or are they refugees and to be fair we

152
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,849
should only really talk about refugees

153
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:57,559
if now officially they are considered

154
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,659
economic migrants but let's be honest

155
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,610
these are not ambitious people trying to

156
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,589
achieve the American dream in most cases

157
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,629
they're just people escaping extreme

158
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,639
violence in many cases they're women and

159
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,889
children who are threatened by a Mara or

160
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:12,169
a drug gang they would almost certainly

161
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,599
be killed if they went back this is why

162
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,300
they will do whatever it takes to leave

163
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,279
and I say whatever it takes because they

164
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,960
really do take no prisoners there are

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,779
more than 3000 kilometres that's 1,800

166
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,330
miles between Guatemala and El Paso

167
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,849
taxes any of these migrants they do the

168
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,710
journey by foot others do it by the

169
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,389
so-called death train and you can

170
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:34,490
imagine why they call it that's

171
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,060
[Music]

172
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,920
so what happens when these people cross

173
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,570
the border well most of them are just

174
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,340
apprehended and deported to their home

175
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,890
countries but let's be fair here some

176
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,230
make it to America US authorities have

177
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,690
already created many programs to attend

178
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,570
to those refugees in 2017 more than

179
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,310
fifty nine thousand Central Americans

180
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,230
stayed in the country was that too much

181
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,720
or too little well it's up to you to

182
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,310
make your own judgments on that one but

183
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,980
the question is how many did Mexico

184
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,440
accept we don't have an exact number but

185
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,870
it is much smaller and here's what we

186
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,230
know in Mexico today there are about

187
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,970
50,000 Guatemalans while the United

188
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,460
States hosts 900,000

189
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,310
so you might be wondering now well why

190
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,130
why can't Central American refugees

191
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,050
remain in Mexico let's have a look shall

192
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,360
we

193
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,940
no country for foreigners in Mexico they

194
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,860
have made it very clear not all migrants

195
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,660
are made equal for example if you are

196
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,850
watching this video from America do not

197
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,240
worry

198
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,180
Mexico will welcome you with the most

199
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,340
open of arms in fact most of the

200
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,020
migrants living there they come from the

201
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,180
United States Oh believe me have a look

202
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:57,120
at this chart Mexico has 1.2 million of

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,610
these migrants today of course 900,000

204
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,170
are American 27,000 to Spanish and only

205
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,450
15,000 come from Honduras Mexico has

206
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,580
more Germans than it does Salvadorians

207
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,170
and this is surprising considering the

208
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,600
Salvadorians are much closer they speak

209
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,180
the same language and are leaving their

210
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,070
country by the thousands so you might be

211
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,020
wondering well why is this is it pure

212
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,630
chance to Central Americans not like

213
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,100
Mexico of course not

214
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,440
just look at what Mexican immigration

215
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,540
law says

216
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,160
[Applause]

217
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,200
secretaries say can deny entry to a

218
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,990
foreigner into his country or change the

219
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,580
characteristics of their migrant status

220
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,060
at any time if the demographic balance

221
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,100
requires it yep you heard that right

222
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,110
this demographic balance it's just a

223
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,380
nice way of saying if you're poor you're

224
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,240
not allowed to live here and when it

225
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,800
says changing the characteristics of

226
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,990
their migrate status it basically means

227
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,550
that they could just tell you to fuck

228
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,860
off whenever they like all right I know

229
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,390
you might be thinking things are

230
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,670
changing and of course they are just

231
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,050
like what the former Mexican president

232
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,530
said in October of 2018 Oh Mexico takes

233
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,020
the end element today Mexico gives you

234
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,420
its hand we want you and all the

235
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,850
migrants to feel protected and calm and

overall they make equus talents in order

237
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,500

see on screen is Enrique Pena Nieto

246
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,160
former Mexican president this was one of

247
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,080
his last policies before leaving office

248
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,960
his successor and live agreed with this

249
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,240
plan and total Trump he also agreed all

250
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,530
of a sudden his southern neighbor

251
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,570
accepted migrants so Americans didn't

252
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,520
have to but the hold of a minute as we

253
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,960
said at the beginning words are one

254
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,390
thing and facts are another sure at the

255
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,560
beginning the Mexican government

256
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,510
accepted people from Central America in

257
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,820
a few months more than 20,000 Waterman's

258
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,890
Hondurans and Salvadorians came to the

259
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,260
country asking for a visa and how did

260
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,750
the Mexicans like that big surprise not

261
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,980
very much

262
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,990
[Music]

263
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,240
according to a survey 58% of Mexicans

264
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,400
don't want migrants entering the country

265
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,290
exactly Trump is not alone in hating

266
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,420
migrants and refugees and to that the

267
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,980
fact that the Mexican authorities can't

268
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,300
deal with so many people crossing the

269
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,250
southern border by the way I mean think

270
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,720
about it you need to build shelters

271
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,180
print those visas and feed all of those

272
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,130
people and you need money for that and

273
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,900
you need political capital and the New

274
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,190
Mexican president he doesn't want to

275
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,570
risk any of those things

276
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,520
he's extremely popular and he doesn't

277
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,650
want to stop being popular so with

278
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,720
Mexican society against migrants and the

279
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,370
army and the police with no resources

280
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,310
the New Mexican presidents had only one

281
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,829
choice

282
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,779
Mexico triples deportations of Central

283
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,699
Americans with Lopez Obrador

284
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,029
the new government has removed more than

285
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,250
45,000 people in five months 15,000 of

286
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,720
those were in April now you might be

287
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,029
wondering what are the consequences of

288
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,130
this policy of course the biggest

289
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,529
victims are those hundreds of thousands

290
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,029
of Central Americans who cannot stay in

291
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:15,279
Mexico or in America this is not the

292
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,560
only consequence think about it if amlo

293
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,209
doesn't want the refugees where are they

294
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,519
gonna go exactly they can keep making

295
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,949
their way to the United States the land

296
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,769
of the free so the hot potato it pulls

297
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,889
right back into Donald Trump's hands it

298
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,980
is then in May of 2019 that the White

299
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,350
House threatens Mexico with 5% tariffs

300
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,149
in other words this is where the Mexican

301
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:38,649
government finds itself between the

302
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:41,649
hammer and the anvil if the Mexican

303
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:43,570
president takes in so many refugees the

304
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,610
Mexicans are gonna hate him and if he

305
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,410
doesn't work Donald Trump is gonna

306
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:53,510
punish him so what's his solution

307
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,240
the US government's remain in Mexico

308
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,240
policies expanding stranding more people

309
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,730
in a dangerous Mexican city in other

310
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,310
words in May of 2019 Trump went to a low

311
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,699
and said look Mexico dude I don't give

312
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:09,050
two shits about what you do with your

313
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,120
central Americans it's really not my

314
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,199
problem you want to take them they're

315
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,880
all yours want to deport them whatever

316
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,899
dude you can deport them Canada Russia

317
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,350
fucking Mars it's on you bro just one

318
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,329
thing I don't want to see those fucks

319
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:26,269
crossing my border and if I do you're

320
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,699
gonna pay for it hombre that's right

321
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,339
you're gonna pay so what was the easiest

322
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,279
solution to envelope all those

323
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,370
immigrants stay in a ghetto Mexico has

324
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,100
deployed 6,000 troops to contain them so

325
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,690
they haven't been deported but they

326
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,430
cannot continue on their way to

327
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,620
integrate into Mexican society for

328
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,389
example in the most recent of months

329
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:48,829
many of those immigrants have been

330
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,720
concentrated in cities like new wave a

331
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,240
Laredo at the border with the US and

332
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,620
they're in really poor conditions by the

333
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,500
way big shocker there are no doctors

334
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,839
there's no food and violence is starting

335
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,030
to arise up

336
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,620
[Music]

337
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,480
the worst place of all is the sitting or

338
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,790
tap a hula at the border with Guatemala

339
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,240
over 20,000 and 30,000 asylum pledges

340
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,860
have been registered here and the

341
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,450
Mexican army has been stationed there

342
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,100
stopping people from going any further

343
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,710
north oh and yeah lots of murders are

344
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,450
already happening so in other words

345
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,130
those refugees ended up in the same

346
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,170
situation that they were escaping from

347
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,410
neither America or Mexico wants them and

348
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,730
while those two countries just keep

349
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,530
throwing our potato to one another these

350
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,080
people are dying

351
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,590
[Music]

352
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,200
so the question now goes to you how do

353
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,820
you think this problem can be solved do

354
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,950
you think Mexico could do anything to

355
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,140
accept the refugees or is it really only

356
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,779
America's job could they really reach a

357
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,150
deal to share responsibility well please
