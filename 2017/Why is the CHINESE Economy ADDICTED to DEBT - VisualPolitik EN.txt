00:00:05.65 --> 00:00:10.380
[Music]

3
00:00:07.58 --> 00:00:12.809
we can't hide it here a visual politic

4
00:00:10.38 --> 00:00:15.210
we love Asia and that's partly because

5
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:24.000
we believe that the world center is

6
00:00:15.21 --> 00:00:26.160
already on this continent but in the

7
00:00:24.0 --> 00:00:28.590
last few decades one country has stood

8
00:00:26.16 --> 00:00:34.620
out of that crowd and that country well

9
00:00:28.59 --> 00:00:36.480
it's China for its huge size and the

10
00:00:34.62 --> 00:00:38.640
speed of which this country is growing

11
00:00:36.48 --> 00:00:40.500
China deserves to be given the chief

12
00:00:38.64 --> 00:00:42.809
role in this super production that is

13
00:00:40.5 --> 00:00:44.670
changing our planet but wait just a

14
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.969
second let's not rush into this whole

15
00:00:44.67 --> 00:00:47.579
thing

16
00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
China it's certainly not perfect indeed

17
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.789
the country had some pretty major

18
00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.980
problems on the 23rd of may 2017 Moody's

19
00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.629
one of the three agencies in charge of

20
00:00:55.98 --> 00:00:59.550
rating the solvency and risk of

21
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.699
financial products downgraded the rating

22
00:00:59.55 --> 00:01:04.890
of China's debt and this is the first

23
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.340
reduction Moody's has made on China's

24
00:01:04.89 --> 00:01:10.409
debt in 27 years yeah okay now I know

25
00:01:08.34 --> 00:01:12.840
you're thinking leadings really rating

26
00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.880
agencies in general and they rarely seem

27
00:01:12.84 --> 00:01:16.229
to get it right and yeah while that is

28
00:01:14.88 --> 00:01:18.080
true it is also one of the only things

29
00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.430
that we have to judge this sort of thing

30
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:22.409
confessors still overwhelmingly rely on

31
00:01:20.43 --> 00:01:24.780
Standard and Poor's Moody's and Fitch

32
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.540
when deciding whether to buy bonds the

33
00:01:24.78 --> 00:01:30.210
three issue more than 95% of global bond

34
00:01:27.54 --> 00:01:32.759
ratings the thing is dear viewers China

35
00:01:30.21 --> 00:01:36.090
has faced two major threats in the last

36
00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.180
few years less growth and much much more

37
00:01:36.09 --> 00:01:43.880
debt in fact this has even led to an

38
00:01:39.18 --> 00:01:43.880
important question can China go bankrupt

39
00:01:43.94 --> 00:01:49.090
[Music]

40
00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.679
China's great growth if we had a sign

41
00:01:49.09 --> 00:01:52.929
machine and the opportunities travel

42
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.210
bags mouths China the country we would

43
00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.829
find would be completely different to

44
00:01:55.21 --> 00:01:59.530
the one that we find today there

45
00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.969
wouldn't be any skyscrapers anymore in

46
00:01:59.53 --> 00:02:03.700
fact there really wouldn't be much of

47
00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.789
anything in the nineteen seventies China

48
00:02:03.7 --> 00:02:15.400
was a mainly agricultural country and it

49
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:18.190
was extremely poor but a few years after

50
00:02:15.4 --> 00:02:20.349
Mao had died a man known as dong Jinping

51
00:02:18.19 --> 00:02:22.750
came to power and he realized that

52
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.459
communism well it really hadn't worked

53
00:02:22.75 --> 00:02:26.319
it's all he immediately put into

54
00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.930
practice a set of measures that that

55
00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.370
would change China forever these reforms

56
00:02:28.93 --> 00:02:31.450
and the change that China has gone

57
00:02:30.37 --> 00:02:33.129
through since they're actually going to

58
00:02:31.45 --> 00:02:34.989
be the subject of an upcoming visual

59
00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:42.519
politic videos so please don't forget to

60
00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:43.540
subscribe to this channel right now all

61
00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.129
right done that

62
00:02:43.54 --> 00:02:46.900
well that's carry-on so now it's

63
00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.250
important to remember something done

64
00:02:46.9 --> 00:02:52.420
jumping was a turning point for China

65
00:02:50.25 --> 00:02:54.340
since then China has undergone the

66
00:02:52.42 --> 00:02:56.440
greatest economical revolution in the

67
00:02:54.34 --> 00:02:58.510
history of mankind in the last three

68
00:02:56.44 --> 00:02:59.980
decades China has managed to take five

69
00:02:58.51 --> 00:03:01.690
hundred million people out of poverty

70
00:02:59.98 --> 00:03:04.630
and to become the largest industrial and

71
00:03:01.69 --> 00:03:06.700
trading power on the planet in other

72
00:03:04.63 --> 00:03:08.470
words if we ask any Chinese person

73
00:03:06.7 --> 00:03:10.239
without his or her living standards the

74
00:03:08.47 --> 00:03:14.160
answer will be as it and now is

75
00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.160
infinitely better than it was before

76
00:03:17.14 --> 00:03:21.850
and please don't get me wrong there is

77
00:03:19.84 --> 00:03:24.010
still a lot of poverty in China but

78
00:03:21.85 --> 00:03:24.850
compared to how it was it's a whole lot

79
00:03:24.01 --> 00:03:26.590
better today

80
00:03:24.85 --> 00:03:28.480
but as I was saying earlier it's

81
00:03:26.59 --> 00:03:32.820
certainly not all roses and there are

82
00:03:28.48 --> 00:03:32.820
some serious clouds on there risin a

83
00:03:33.63 --> 00:03:39.460
system addicted to debt are they quick

84
00:03:37.81 --> 00:03:41.770
look at this chart which shows what

85
00:03:39.46 --> 00:03:47.260
happens to Chinese debt in the last few

86
00:03:41.77 --> 00:03:49.209
years as you can see it goes up and up

87
00:03:47.26 --> 00:03:51.670
burns up and I mean well that's a

88
00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.990
seriously speed line on the other hand

89
00:03:51.67 --> 00:03:57.160
the closely of what has happened to

90
00:03:52.99 --> 00:03:58.690
Chinese economic groups as you can see

91
00:03:57.16 --> 00:04:02.410
well this chart it's headed in the

92
00:03:58.69 --> 00:04:04.750
opposite direction so in other words in

93
00:04:02.41 --> 00:04:07.450
China the economy is declining and the

94
00:04:04.75 --> 00:04:10.610
debt won't stop rising

95
00:04:07.45 --> 00:04:10.610
[Music]

96
00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:18.000
look in gross terms the Chinese debt as

97
00:04:13.62 --> 00:04:20.489
multiplying by four since 2007 the

98
00:04:18.0 --> 00:04:22.440
Chinese debt now equals more than 260

99
00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.550
percent of the GDP and many analysts

100
00:04:22.44 --> 00:04:25.380
consider this number to be especially

101
00:04:23.55 --> 00:04:28.260
high for a country that is yet to become

102
00:04:25.38 --> 00:04:29.460
one of the richest in the world well

103
00:04:28.26 --> 00:04:36.780
most of the debt is actually the

104
00:04:29.46 --> 00:04:38.550
responsibility of Chinese companies well

105
00:04:36.78 --> 00:04:40.889
the thing is there is a silver lining

106
00:04:38.55 --> 00:04:42.840
but there is also a significant negative

107
00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.419
side and that is that all this

108
00:04:42.84 --> 00:04:47.700
international expansion needs money and

109
00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.740
swell a great deal of it and while much

110
00:04:47.7 --> 00:04:51.720
of the debt has financed the expansion

111
00:04:49.74 --> 00:04:54.139
of Chinese companies they have also paid

112
00:04:51.72 --> 00:04:56.400
well for this kind of nonsense

113
00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.260
throughout China there are hundreds of

114
00:04:56.4 --> 00:04:59.850
cities that have almost everything one

115
00:04:58.26 --> 00:05:02.130
needs from modern urban lifestyle

116
00:04:59.85 --> 00:05:04.560
high-rise apartment complexes developed

117
00:05:02.13 --> 00:05:07.289
waterfronts skyscrapers and even public

118
00:05:04.56 --> 00:05:09.669
art everything that is except one major

119
00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.919
factor people

120
00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.689
so you get an idea of the size of all

121
00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.849
that has been built in China in the last

122
00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:18.340
few years pay attention to the following

123
00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.349
number in just three years China is used

124
00:05:18.34 --> 00:05:24.249
more concrete than the United States

125
00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.289
used in the entire 20th century and as I

126
00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.860
said everything absolutely everything

127
00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.560
has been paid for with yes so now we

128
00:05:29.86 --> 00:05:34.419
come to a really important what the hell

129
00:05:32.56 --> 00:05:41.080
has happened in this country to cause it

130
00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:46.840
to get into quite so much debt the

131
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:48.279
Chinese government's forward flight the

132
00:05:46.84 --> 00:05:49.990
last few decades if you could say that

133
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.689
Chinese people were good at one thing

134
00:05:49.99 --> 00:05:54.669
well it would be saving money this is

135
00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.129
especially true of the oldest Chinese

136
00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.650
citizens they work and they save and

137
00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:00.879
well that is pretty much all they do so

138
00:05:59.65 --> 00:06:02.889
thanks to all of that effort

139
00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.900
China has high investment rates but

140
00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.029
don't be fooled what has happened in the

141
00:06:04.9 --> 00:06:10.360
last few years having nothing to do with

142
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:12.819
it in order to know what happens we need

143
00:06:10.36 --> 00:06:14.560
to go back to 2008 at that time all

144
00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.449
developed countries were going through a

145
00:06:14.56 --> 00:06:18.250
major financial crisis and you can

146
00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.770
probably imagine how this affected

147
00:06:18.25 --> 00:06:24.849
China's exports which are the engine

148
00:06:20.77 --> 00:06:26.409
that keeps driving China forward the

149
00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.029
traces but at that time the Chinese

150
00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.409
government was terrified that the

151
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.419
country would be affected by the

152
00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.029
international crisis so in order to

153
00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.009
prevent it they came up with an idea the

154
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:38.500
economic system had to be transformed

155
00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.270
and they had to bet on domestic demand

156
00:06:38.5 --> 00:06:42.460
and when it comes to in the mouth of a

157
00:06:40.27 --> 00:06:44.710
politician that domestic demand thing

158
00:06:42.46 --> 00:06:47.319
almost always means they are planning to

159
00:06:44.71 --> 00:06:50.159
start overspending and salome that's

160
00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:52.349
exactly what Beijing did

161
00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.330
in 2008 the Chinese government started a

162
00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.819
colossal program of extra public

163
00:06:54.33 --> 00:06:58.349
spending of four trillion UN about six

164
00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.909
hundred billion dollars meant to be used

165
00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.039
for building all kinds of infrastructure

166
00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:06.389
high-speed trains Underground trains

167
00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:08.099
highways houses offices etc ah they went

168
00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.599
further than that the Chinese

169
00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:11.639
government's thoughts that government

170
00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.439
overspending wasn't enough so they had

171
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.239
to encourage the companies to do the

172
00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:17.129
same so the question was how could they

173
00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:21.689
do that well they decided to use a

174
00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:22.800
traditional remedy in 2008 China also

175
00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.990
started one of the most expansive

176
00:07:22.8 --> 00:07:26.789
monetary policies ever known the

177
00:07:24.99 --> 00:07:29.009
authorities lowered interest rates and

178
00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.360
banks gave money loans to everyone who

179
00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.259
asked for them they practically

180
00:07:30.36 --> 00:07:35.969
established an open bar of cheap loans

181
00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:38.099
in three years the price of housing with

182
00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.740
an average of 2.4 times more expensive

183
00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.419
so an apartment which cost $100,000

184
00:07:40.74 --> 00:07:45.029
three years before would now be worth

185
00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.409
two hundred and forty thousand dollars

186
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:48.509
and so what was the result of all of

187
00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:50.819
this well companies started to make all

188
00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:52.860
kinds of investments they built ghost

189
00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:54.990
towns bought out companies all over the

190
00:07:52.86 --> 00:07:56.939
world and engaged in all kinds of

191
00:07:54.99 --> 00:07:59.069
projects they took on whatever crazy

192
00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:00.839
risky projects they felt like after all

193
00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:03.509
the central bank was pretty much giving

194
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:05.249
money away over production in key

195
00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:07.199
industries are damaging both China's

196
00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:09.990
economic sustainability and foreign

197
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.149
trade relations obviously many of these

198
00:08:09.99 --> 00:08:13.860
projects have never been profitable so

199
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:15.839
the companies can't give the money back

200
00:08:13.86 --> 00:08:17.729
so what do they do then

201
00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:20.309
well they simply ask for new loans to

202
00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:22.619
pay back the old one than the snobol

203
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:24.779
kept rolling and getting bigger and

204
00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:27.569
bigger and this is how the Chinese

205
00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:29.309
economy became addicted to debt and now

206
00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:32.189
I've probably got an idea of what you're

207
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:36.240
thinking stupid private companies right

208
00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:37.979
well not exactly more than half of the

209
00:08:36.24 --> 00:08:39.839
bank debt in China consists of loans

210
00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:42.870
from state-owned banks to state-owned

211
00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:46.820
enterprises and wait just a second

212
00:08:42.87 --> 00:08:48.329
because there is so much more

213
00:08:46.82 --> 00:08:50.579
[Music]

214
00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:52.260
Chinese banks a weapon of mass

215
00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:54.120
destruction

216
00:08:52.26 --> 00:08:56.550
we've already seen how China is

217
00:08:54.12 --> 00:08:58.500
currently going through a debt overdose

218
00:08:56.55 --> 00:09:01.800
but as if this wasn't enough there is

219
00:08:58.5 --> 00:09:05.639
another danger hiding in the bushes back

220
00:09:01.8 --> 00:09:07.440
in the shadows nice face certain

221
00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:09.660
limitations on the amount of money they

222
00:09:07.44 --> 00:09:12.000
can load but Chinese banks have managed

223
00:09:09.66 --> 00:09:13.829
to skip these controls and in way these

224
00:09:12.0 --> 00:09:16.079
banks have just copied what American

225
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:19.320
banks were doing with them mortgages let

226
00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:21.750
me explain instead of just giving loans

227
00:09:19.32 --> 00:09:24.000
they set up off balance companies that

228
00:09:21.75 --> 00:09:25.980
issued the debt of the banks then bought

229
00:09:24.0 --> 00:09:27.389
and lien surprised surprised when you

230
00:09:25.98 --> 00:09:30.120
look at the bank's accounts are not

231
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:32.459
listed as loans that are rather as other

232
00:09:30.12 --> 00:09:34.769
investments it's actually a pretty small

233
00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:36.690
workaround right well it is estimated

234
00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:39.269
the Chinese banks have hidden more than

235
00:09:36.69 --> 00:09:41.130
two trillion dollars and it has a

236
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:43.920
straightforward consequence Chinese

237
00:09:41.13 --> 00:09:45.899
banks can be way less solvent than their

238
00:09:43.92 --> 00:09:48.269
official numbers might indicate and

239
00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:50.850
besides much of this debt is opaque so

240
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:53.670
the actual Chinese debt could be much

241
00:09:50.85 --> 00:09:55.170
much higher the fast spread of

242
00:09:53.67 --> 00:09:56.880
off-balance activities in Bank

243
00:09:55.17 --> 00:09:58.350
investment actually means a risk of

244
00:09:56.88 --> 00:10:00.829
hidden loans which could threaten

245
00:09:58.35 --> 00:10:02.610
China's financial security xiangfu lien

246
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:05.010
ex-president of China's Banking

247
00:10:02.61 --> 00:10:07.360
Regulatory Commission and wait because

248
00:10:05.01 --> 00:10:09.399
there's more

249
00:10:07.36 --> 00:10:11.380
the growing number of non-bank financial

250
00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:13.300
firms also market their own wealth

251
00:10:11.38 --> 00:10:15.070
management products and invest the money

252
00:10:13.3 --> 00:10:17.620
with little disclosure of where the

253
00:10:15.07 --> 00:10:19.720
money goes that's right in the last few

254
00:10:17.62 --> 00:10:21.760
years those companies which get money

255
00:10:19.72 --> 00:10:24.190
from people to make investments that are

256
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:26.769
risky and opaque have become more and

257
00:10:24.19 --> 00:10:28.329
more popular and twelve why is that well

258
00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:30.430
it's obviously because they're going to

259
00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:32.200
get higher rates of return with those

260
00:10:30.43 --> 00:10:34.570
investments the thing is that this

261
00:10:32.2 --> 00:10:36.700
craving for loans has caused quite a bit

262
00:10:34.57 --> 00:10:38.740
of indigestion this is a risk the

263
00:10:36.7 --> 00:10:41.350
government has admitted and it has tried

264
00:10:38.74 --> 00:10:43.750
to limit company loans but since there

265
00:10:41.35 --> 00:10:46.180
are a lot of unsold ghost towns empty

266
00:10:43.75 --> 00:10:47.890
houses and bankrupt real estate agencies

267
00:10:46.18 --> 00:10:50.410
the government has told the banks in the

268
00:10:47.89 --> 00:10:52.480
last few years to give away loans as if

269
00:10:50.41 --> 00:10:56.410
there was no tomorrow because well the

270
00:10:52.48 --> 00:10:58.089
family debt level is still so low that

271
00:10:56.41 --> 00:11:00.250
economists note that China's mortgage

272
00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:02.980
loans increased by thirty five percent

273
00:11:00.25 --> 00:11:04.959
in 2016 and now this view you might be

274
00:11:02.98 --> 00:11:06.760
beginning to see why some analysts are

275
00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:08.980
warning that if they don't stop this

276
00:11:06.76 --> 00:11:11.320
dead vortex China could become a new

277
00:11:08.98 --> 00:11:14.230
Japan a country that has been in crisis

278
00:11:11.32 --> 00:11:16.510
since the 1980s and there is still more

279
00:11:14.23 --> 00:11:19.149
because now we know why she Jinping and

280
00:11:16.51 --> 00:11:21.040
China need globalization quite so much

281
00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:23.260
their accompanying a need for a market

282
00:11:21.04 --> 00:11:27.430
to deal with all of the debt that they

283
00:11:23.26 --> 00:11:29.649
have issued but not everything is all

284
00:11:27.43 --> 00:11:31.750
doom and gloom and the future well it's

285
00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:33.640
still to come in China the savings rates

286
00:11:31.75 --> 00:11:37.120
are still high high enough for foreign

287
00:11:33.64 --> 00:11:40.520
capital to arrive in the country

288
00:11:37.12 --> 00:11:42.980
but there is a risk and Moody's has

289
00:11:40.52 --> 00:11:44.750
given the first warning now it's the

290
00:11:42.98 --> 00:11:47.120
time for the government to start working

291
00:11:44.75 --> 00:11:48.470
to make reforms and now well we'd love

292
00:11:47.12 --> 00:11:50.780
to know your thoughts you can tell us

293

what you think in this survey as well as

294
00:11:50.78 --> 00:11:54.650
in the comments below this video what do

295
00:11:52.4 --> 00:11:56.660
you think will happen in China do you

296
00:11:54.65 --> 00:11:58.310
think that stagnation will turn it into

297
00:11:56.66 --> 00:12:00.470
a new Japan or do you think they'll be

298
00:11:58.31 --> 00:12:02.300
new reforms which will open China even

299
00:12:00.47 --> 00:12:03.770
more to the west well I do really hope

300
