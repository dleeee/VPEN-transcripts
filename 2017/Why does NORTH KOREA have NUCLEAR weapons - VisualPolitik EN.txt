00:00:00.0 --> 00:00:01.980
Oh

00:00:00.11 --> 00:00:08.389
[Applause]

4
00:00:13.21 --> 00:00:17.720
it seems to be that in the Korean

5
00:00:15.62 --> 00:00:25.670
Peninsula zigs runs of war are

6
00:00:17.72 --> 00:00:28.070
constantly rumbling and it's certainly

7
00:00:25.67 --> 00:00:29.869
true that this area is not known for its

8
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:31.670
peacefulness but the kind of tension

9
00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.680
that the area has been recently feeling

10
00:00:31.67 --> 00:00:35.120
have not existed for some time the

11
00:00:33.68 --> 00:00:37.520
United States the country which already

12
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:39.350
had 30,000 soldiers deployed in the area

13
00:00:37.52 --> 00:00:41.600
has also deployed several aircraft

14
00:00:39.35 --> 00:00:43.340
carriers heavy bombers and even an

15
00:00:41.6 --> 00:00:45.800
advanced anti-missile system in South

16
00:00:43.34 --> 00:00:47.899
Korea it is so advanced that China has

17
00:00:45.8 --> 00:00:50.899
even considered it a threat to their own

18
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.140
security China tells us to remove

19
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.079
anti-missile thaa ad system from South

20
00:00:54.14 --> 00:00:58.760
Korea amid spying fears North Korea on

21
00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.739
the other hand keeps carrying out a new

22
00:00:58.76 --> 00:01:02.989
tests with ballistic missile sounds

23
00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.610
progressing with its nuclear program it

24
00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.320
seems that North Korea doesn't really

25
00:01:04.61 --> 00:01:08.420
care about all the international

26
00:01:06.32 --> 00:01:10.700
legislation about non-proliferation and

27
00:01:08.42 --> 00:01:13.700
nuclear testing Japan and South Korea

28
00:01:10.7 --> 00:01:15.470
are feeling understandably tense they

29
00:01:13.7 --> 00:01:17.869
want to know what to do what decisions

30
00:01:15.47 --> 00:01:19.640
to make step by step in order to stop

31
00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.330
the growing threat that is kim

32
00:01:19.64 --> 00:01:23.479
jeong-hoon

33
00:01:20.33 --> 00:01:26.780
but not North Korea's most recent

34
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.849
missile launch is absolutely intolerable

35
00:01:26.78 --> 00:01:30.410
yayan victim attempts we already told

36
00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.899
you in a previous video here a visual

37
00:01:30.41 --> 00:01:34.490
politic about how Japan is seriously

38
00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.770
considering putting an end to the

39
00:01:34.49 --> 00:01:38.209
pacifist nature of their constitution

40
00:01:36.77 --> 00:01:41.000
and it seems that right now even they

41
00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:43.759
Jin has had enough of Pyongyang trying

42
00:01:41.0 --> 00:01:46.310
to reportedly sent 150,000 troops not to

43
00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.990
his border if this story were a movie

44
00:01:46.31 --> 00:01:49.789
you'd probably leave the cinema thinking

45
00:01:47.99 --> 00:01:52.479
that the writer had taken too much

46
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.740
creative Liberty dynamics violence

47
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.140
savage axis

48
00:01:54.74 --> 00:02:01.020
spectacular thrill Godzilla king of the

49
00:01:58.14 --> 00:02:03.479
monsters but what is really happening in

50
00:02:01.02 --> 00:02:05.070
this region what can we actually expect

51
00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.440
well that's what we're going to talk

52
00:02:05.07 --> 00:02:09.420
about in this visual politics video

53
00:02:07.44 --> 00:02:17.040
above before we get into all of that

54
00:02:09.42 --> 00:02:20.170
let's get some perspective where are we

55
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:22.660
and how did we get to this situation

56
00:02:20.17 --> 00:02:24.940
North Korea is some sort of nightmare in

57
00:02:22.66 --> 00:02:27.010
the past it's a country still living in

58
00:02:24.94 --> 00:02:29.080
the Cold War a country with one of the

59
00:02:27.01 --> 00:02:31.330
most totalitarian governments in the

60
00:02:29.08 --> 00:02:34.150
world and along with all of that it's

61
00:02:31.33 --> 00:02:36.520
also one of the poorest countries on the

62
00:02:34.15 --> 00:02:39.070
planet according to the United Nations

63
00:02:36.52 --> 00:02:41.410
two out of five North Koreans suffer

64
00:02:39.07 --> 00:02:43.390
from undernourishment busts Kim jong-un

65
00:02:41.41 --> 00:02:45.610
the guy who controls the country with an

66
00:02:43.39 --> 00:02:48.880
iron fist doesn't seem to give a damn

67
00:02:45.61 --> 00:02:50.890
about any of that so it is estimated

68
00:02:48.88 --> 00:02:53.290
that Pyongyang started to develop its

69
00:02:50.89 --> 00:02:55.420
nuclear program around the 1980s and

70
00:02:53.29 --> 00:02:57.400
since then there have been a few key

71
00:02:55.42 --> 00:02:59.170
situations which has sped up this

72
00:02:57.4 --> 00:03:02.500
progress the first was the fall of the

73
00:02:59.17 --> 00:03:04.900
Soviet Union in 1991 then game george w

74
00:03:02.5 --> 00:03:08.019
bush's incorporation of north korea into

75
00:03:04.9 --> 00:03:09.760
these so-called axis of evil in 2002 and

76
00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.910
then the wrister coming to power of kim

77
00:03:09.76 --> 00:03:15.160
jeong-hoon in 2011 we could say that

78
00:03:12.91 --> 00:03:17.830
every time the regime felt threatened

79
00:03:15.16 --> 00:03:19.720
they decided to accelerate the process

80
00:03:17.83 --> 00:03:23.080
barson we're going to discuss that later

81
00:03:19.72 --> 00:03:24.880
in the video the issue is today

82
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:27.190
it is estimated that North Korea holds

83
00:03:24.88 --> 00:03:29.530
from 10 to 20 nuclear weapons and

84
00:03:27.19 --> 00:03:31.030
according to the RAND Corporation if it

85
00:03:29.53 --> 00:03:32.829
doesn't stop producing them the North

86
00:03:31.03 --> 00:03:35.340
Korean program could accumulate around a

87
00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.630
hundred nuclear bombs by the year 2020

88
00:03:35.34 --> 00:03:40.000
let's do wait for just a second because

89
00:03:37.63 --> 00:03:42.130
this isn't the end of the story but now

90
00:03:40.0 --> 00:03:44.920
the technology used in this country is

91
00:03:42.13 --> 00:03:46.600
well it's pretty basic it's based on old

92
00:03:44.92 --> 00:03:48.130
designs from the Soviet Union

93
00:03:46.6 --> 00:03:50.670
so the bombs they have developed up

94
00:03:48.13 --> 00:03:53.950
until now they don't work brilliantly

95
00:03:50.67 --> 00:03:56.350
VFL physical cycle are you guys exactly

96
00:03:53.95 --> 00:03:58.840
and that is why Pyongyang is now

97
00:03:56.35 --> 00:04:01.090
obsessed with two things on the one hand

98
00:03:58.84 --> 00:04:05.019
attempting to militarize the bomb so

99
00:04:01.09 --> 00:04:06.220
they can be placed in missiles on the

100
00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.650
other hands developing ballistic

101
00:04:06.22 --> 00:04:11.140
missiles capable of attacking targets

102
00:04:08.65 --> 00:04:12.430
that are thousands of miles away ante

103
00:04:11.14 --> 00:04:14.290
the last tests they've conducted

104
00:04:12.43 --> 00:04:17.139
indicate that they are probably making

105
00:04:14.29 --> 00:04:19.909
some important advances

106
00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.620
many analysts including the intelligence

107
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.689
services of South Korea and the United

108
00:04:21.62 --> 00:04:26.150
States have considered that North Korea

109
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.710
is already capable of weaponizing short

110
00:04:26.15 --> 00:04:29.870
and mid-range missiles with nuclear

111
00:04:27.71 --> 00:04:33.620
warheads which could allow them to reach

112
00:04:29.87 --> 00:04:35.509
South Korea and Japan and so that's not

113
00:04:33.62 --> 00:04:37.909
all it seems clear that if the program

114
00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.159
doesn't stop in a few years North Korea

115
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.900
will be capable of attacking the United

116
00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.240
States of America with ballistic

117
00:04:41.9 --> 00:04:46.699
missiles this would be a significant

118
00:04:44.24 --> 00:04:49.159
strategic leap for North Korea and that

119
00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:53.860
dear friends is a redline which is

120
00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.860
causing the Pentagon many many headaches

121
00:04:57.68 --> 00:05:01.830
so now you might be wondering well that

122
00:05:00.06 --> 00:05:04.140
in the u.s. done anything to stop this

123
00:05:01.83 --> 00:05:10.590
country and well the truth is that they

124
00:05:04.14 --> 00:05:14.460
have tried almost everything the US

125
00:05:10.59 --> 00:05:15.870
strategy per year the United States and

126
00:05:14.46 --> 00:05:17.970
South Korea have trying to persuade

127
00:05:15.87 --> 00:05:20.580
Pyongyang to abandon their plan of

128
00:05:17.97 --> 00:05:22.200
developing nuclear weapons and well they

129
00:05:20.58 --> 00:05:25.500
didn't have any problem taking out the

130
00:05:22.2 --> 00:05:28.110
checkbook in order to do this in the

131
00:05:25.5 --> 00:05:30.150
early 90s 1994 to be specific Bill

132
00:05:28.11 --> 00:05:32.610
Clinton signed the agreement framework

133
00:05:30.15 --> 00:05:34.470
by which North Korea committed to cancel

134
00:05:32.61 --> 00:05:36.450
its military plans in exchange for

135
00:05:34.47 --> 00:05:38.370
generous fuel help from the United

136
00:05:36.45 --> 00:05:40.640
States as well as assistance to build

137
00:05:38.37 --> 00:05:43.410
two nuclear reactors for civilian use

138
00:05:40.64 --> 00:05:45.600
with this agreement North Korea obtains

139
00:05:43.41 --> 00:05:47.880
the energy they needed to develop the

140
00:05:45.6 --> 00:05:50.190
economy as for South Korea besides

141
00:05:47.88 --> 00:05:52.680
giving a huge amount of humanitarian aid

142
00:05:50.19 --> 00:05:54.540
they also committed to boost and finance

143
00:05:52.68 --> 00:05:56.790
North Korea's economic development

144
00:05:54.54 --> 00:05:59.100
programs it all seemed to be going well

145
00:05:56.79 --> 00:06:01.890
for a while however it all those pieces

146
00:05:59.1 --> 00:06:04.230
in 2002 when george w bush found out

147
00:06:01.89 --> 00:06:06.450
that Pyongyang had been fooling them in

148
00:06:04.23 --> 00:06:08.640
secret North Korea had kept developing

149
00:06:06.45 --> 00:06:10.860
its nuclear programs for military

150
00:06:08.64 --> 00:06:12.810
purposes after more negotiations they

151
00:06:10.86 --> 00:06:14.700
reached a new agreement and Bush's

152
00:06:12.81 --> 00:06:16.680
administration restarted their aid

153
00:06:14.7 --> 00:06:19.380
program and lifted sanctions

154
00:06:16.68 --> 00:06:19.890
thus a year later Pyongyang reneged on

155
00:06:19.38 --> 00:06:22.710
the deal

156
00:06:19.89 --> 00:06:25.610
despite all of this Barack Obama decided

157
00:06:22.71 --> 00:06:27.680
to try yet again

158
00:06:25.61 --> 00:06:29.300
in February 2012 they reach a new

159
00:06:27.68 --> 00:06:30.800
agreement North Korea canceled the

160
00:06:29.3 --> 00:06:33.080
nuclear program and the United States

161
00:06:30.8 --> 00:06:35.060
restarted once again the economic game

162
00:06:33.08 --> 00:06:39.139
this time Pyongyang broke the agreement

163
00:06:35.06 --> 00:06:40.580
only six weeks later all right so now

164
00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.500
you're beginning to get the picture so

165
00:06:40.58 --> 00:06:44.719
now you might be wondering well why are

166
00:06:42.5 --> 00:06:53.569
North Korea so insistent on having

167
00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:57.080
nuclear weapons at all what are each

168
00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:59.539
looking for the regime of Kim jong-un is

169
00:06:57.08 --> 00:07:01.610
pretty set on developing more advanced

170
00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:03.740
nuclear weapons and the international

171
00:07:01.61 --> 00:07:05.719
community is going to have to get used

172
00:07:03.74 --> 00:07:08.060
to the idea that this is not something

173
00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:10.430
they are going to abandon but that still

174
00:07:08.06 --> 00:07:12.110
leaves us with the question of why well

175
00:07:10.43 --> 00:07:14.180
first of all because they think nuclear

176
00:07:12.11 --> 00:07:15.800
weapons are essential for their survival

177
00:07:14.18 --> 00:07:17.569
young-young knows that we have nuclear

178
00:07:15.8 --> 00:07:19.940
weapons around no foreign power

179
00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:23.840
especially the United States would dare

180
00:07:19.94 --> 00:07:26.270
to intervene in the country when the

181
00:07:23.84 --> 00:07:28.009
United States invaded Iraq North Korean

182
00:07:26.27 --> 00:07:29.900
leaders they were paying attention but

183
00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.360
then the first mistake Saddam Hussein

184
00:07:29.9 --> 00:07:34.490
made was not having nuclear weapons and

185
00:07:32.36 --> 00:07:36.800
other WMDs they thought the same thing

186
00:07:34.49 --> 00:07:38.719
when Gaddafi's regime self Libya had

187
00:07:36.8 --> 00:07:41.210
voluntarily cancelled its program for

188
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:45.110
development of WMDs a few years earlier

189
00:07:41.21 --> 00:07:47.060
so the North Korean leadership thinks

190
00:07:45.11 --> 00:07:48.979
sounds honestly they're probably right

191
00:07:47.06 --> 00:07:51.289
the nuclear weapons are the best

192
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:53.389
guarantee to staying in power further

193
00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.460
the sales of nuclear weapons technology

194
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.900
is one of the main sources of foreign

195
00:07:55.46 --> 00:07:59.300
currency coming into the country

196
00:07:56.9 --> 00:08:01.250
currency that needed so the elite can

197
00:07:59.3 --> 00:08:03.259
maintain their standards of living since

198
00:08:01.25 --> 00:08:05.779
the fall of the Soviet Union North Korea

199
00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:07.610
has become one of the main exporters of

200
00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.500
missile equipment technology and

201
00:08:07.61 --> 00:08:11.870
components

202
00:08:09.5 --> 00:08:14.270
u.s. ceases North Korean ship taking

203
00:08:11.87 --> 00:08:15.800
missiles to Yemen also indications are

204
00:08:14.27 --> 00:08:18.350
that North Korea has sold you clear

205
00:08:15.8 --> 00:08:20.420
technology to Iran and advised Syria in

206
00:08:18.35 --> 00:08:24.410
the construction of a nuclear reactor

207
00:08:20.42 --> 00:08:26.480
that Israel bombarded in 2007 Israeli

208
00:08:24.41 --> 00:08:29.060
strikes targeted Syrian nuclear reactor

209
00:08:26.48 --> 00:08:31.040
the Telegraph it is precisely this risk

210
00:08:29.06 --> 00:08:33.560
of proliferation which is why the United

211
00:08:31.04 --> 00:08:35.479
States is trying so hard to stop North

212
00:08:33.56 --> 00:08:36.830
Korea the other reasons is of course do

213
00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.870
you try to prevent this country from

214
00:08:36.83 --> 00:08:41.450
being capable of threatening the United

215
00:08:38.87 --> 00:08:43.550
States with a nuclear attack and so well

216
00:08:41.45 --> 00:08:50.510
now we come to China and what China

217
00:08:43.55 --> 00:08:51.950
thinks of all of this China one thing is

218
00:08:50.51 --> 00:08:53.960
certain if it weren't for trying to

219
00:08:51.95 --> 00:08:55.880
support North Korea would have never

220
00:08:53.96 --> 00:08:57.740
developed its nuclear program and it

221
00:08:55.88 --> 00:08:59.270
isn't just the technological part that

222
00:08:57.74 --> 00:09:01.250
we're talking about here all these

223
00:08:59.27 --> 00:09:04.250
support to avoid international penalties

224
00:09:01.25 --> 00:09:06.260
it's also the money China accounts for

225
00:09:04.25 --> 00:09:08.750
more than 90 percent of North Korea's

226
00:09:06.26 --> 00:09:10.550
total trade deal enk in other words

227
00:09:08.75 --> 00:09:12.980
without the support of Beijing this

228
00:09:10.55 --> 00:09:14.810
country would have collapsed a long time

229
00:09:12.98 --> 00:09:16.610
ago however there are some signs which

230
00:09:14.81 --> 00:09:18.860
tell us China well they're a bit tired

231
00:09:16.61 --> 00:09:20.300
of so much provocation then they're not

232
00:09:18.86 --> 00:09:22.040
happy about those nuclear missiles

233
00:09:20.3 --> 00:09:24.589
either it could be said that for Beijing

234
00:09:22.04 --> 00:09:26.360
young yang is now a burden that China

235
00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:27.770
has to deal with as it attempts to gain

236
00:09:26.36 --> 00:09:31.070
influence and leadership in

237
00:09:27.77 --> 00:09:33.410
international politics China takes the

238
00:09:31.07 --> 00:09:35.240
driver's seat on free trade some

239
00:09:33.41 --> 00:09:36.589
analysts have even suggested the Beijing

240
00:09:35.24 --> 00:09:38.480
might be losing control over the

241
00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:40.700
government of Pyongyang which is now

242
00:09:38.48 --> 00:09:42.770
self absorbed by their new nuclear

243
00:09:40.7 --> 00:09:45.680
capability importantly for the first

244
00:09:42.77 --> 00:09:47.510
time in November of 2006 China agreed to

245
00:09:45.68 --> 00:09:49.190
completely stick with the international

246
00:09:47.51 --> 00:09:50.900
sanctions being leveled against North

247
00:09:49.19 --> 00:09:53.360
Korea besides in the last few months

248
00:09:50.9 --> 00:09:55.460
China is forbidden North Korean : ports

249
00:09:53.36 --> 00:09:57.230
and gas exports and well the

250
00:09:55.46 --> 00:09:59.839
international community is holding its

251
00:09:57.23 --> 00:10:02.420
breath that is a significant punishment

252
00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:04.160
for Kim jong-un regime and well there's

253
00:10:02.42 --> 00:10:06.350
more international relations between

254
00:10:04.16 --> 00:10:08.660
these two countries is not at its best

255
00:10:06.35 --> 00:10:09.230
points in fact since Kim jong-un came to

256
00:10:08.66 --> 00:10:11.570
power

257
00:10:09.23 --> 00:10:13.400
no top-level bilateral meetings have

258
00:10:11.57 --> 00:10:15.860
taken place and there are less and less

259
00:10:13.4 --> 00:10:18.110
official visits between the countries so

260
00:10:15.86 --> 00:10:20.000
the question is is Beijing really

261
00:10:18.11 --> 00:10:29.120
changing its relationship with Pyongyang

262
00:10:20.0 --> 00:10:31.220
a road to solution well it is still too

263
00:10:29.12 --> 00:10:33.500
soon tonight but don't be fooled for the

264
00:10:31.22 --> 00:10:35.990
time being China is not going to let

265
00:10:33.5 --> 00:10:38.030
North Korea fall which is still an ally

266
00:10:35.99 --> 00:10:39.980
for them in the region oddly it's not

267
00:10:38.03 --> 00:10:41.570
until they have serious reasons to do so

268
00:10:39.98 --> 00:10:43.640
and well that is a key point to

269
00:10:41.57 --> 00:10:46.040
understand if we want to find a solution

270
00:10:43.64 --> 00:10:47.990
to this crisis China needs to be

271
00:10:46.04 --> 00:10:49.880
persuaded to try and make Pyongyang put

272
00:10:47.99 --> 00:10:52.550
an end to this cancel their nuclear

273
00:10:49.88 --> 00:10:54.470
program and carry out real reforms but

274
00:10:52.55 --> 00:10:56.390
that won't happen under the current set

275
00:10:54.47 --> 00:10:58.220
up that is why many experts think it is

276
00:10:56.39 --> 00:11:00.740
time for the United States to withdraw

277
00:10:58.22 --> 00:11:02.810
from Korea and consider dismantling the

278
00:11:00.74 --> 00:11:05.360
anti-missile system and perhaps consider

279
00:11:02.81 --> 00:11:07.280
some economic compensation as well it is

280
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:09.200
also important that China understands

281
00:11:07.28 --> 00:11:11.450
that the current situation might need

282
00:11:09.2 --> 00:11:13.040
South Korea in Japan to pursue an arms

283
00:11:11.45 --> 00:11:15.980
race as well as the option of developing

284
00:11:13.04 --> 00:11:17.690
their own nuclear weapons so now we've

285
00:11:15.98 --> 00:11:19.310
told you our opinion here at visual

286
00:11:17.69 --> 00:11:21.110
politics and what we'd love to know what

287
00:11:19.31 --> 00:11:23.120
you think click here if you want to

leave your opinion in a quick survey so

289
00:11:23.12 --> 00:11:26.390
what do you think trump administration

290
00:11:24.8 --> 00:11:28.070
should do do you think North Korea

291
00:11:26.39 --> 00:11:30.050
should put an end to its nuclear plans

292
00:11:28.07 --> 00:11:32.180
should they even possibly be threatened

293
00:11:30.05 --> 00:11:34.040
with war well I really hope you enjoyed
