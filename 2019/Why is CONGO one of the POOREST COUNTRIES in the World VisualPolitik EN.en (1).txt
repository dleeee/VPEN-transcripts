1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
look at your mobile phone for a second

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,950
if you opened it up you would see

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,150
something similar to this

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,250
lots of microchips small semiconductors

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,620
and circuits to manufacture all of this

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,080
you need a very special element tantalum

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,970
so where does this tantalum come from

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,270
well it mainly comes from one country

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,630
the Democratic Republic of Congo this is

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,369
one of the world's poorest countries

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,380
it's impossible to estimate how many

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,269
people have died in order to manufacture

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,090
the phone that you have in your hands

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,149
right now tantalum is one of the most

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,890
highly demanded materials on the planet

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,860
and Congo has the largest reserves it

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,379
could be an enormous source of wealth to

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,879
them Congo is actually a country that

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:48,989
has a lot of Natural Resources

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,270
nonetheless it remains one of the

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,610
poorest and most violent countries on

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,890
earth and believe me the history is much

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,600
more complex than those clickbait

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,070
articles you've found on your Twitter

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,760
feed so why is Congo so poor well in

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,409
this video we're going to tell you that

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:05,150
story

28
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,700
[Applause]

29
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,149
[Music]

30
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,710
Kongo is featured in the movie gorillas

31
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,420
in the mist it's funny because we don't

32
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,369
really know anything about this country

33
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,860
despite how often pop-culture references

34
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,380
it

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,880
[Music]

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,830
we're talking about one of the biggest

37
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,720
countries on the planet it has more than

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
80 million inhabitants living within a

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,729
territory the size of Western Europe and

40
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,979
believe me they have a fortune under

41
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,610
their feet

42
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,549
cobalt gold and of course coltan coltan

43
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:42,159
is in fact the ore that tantalum is

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,799
taken from so we all have products that

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,810
are technically imported from Congo in

46
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:51,090
our home

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,430
now many of you might say wow wow that's

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,530
really lucky I mean having so many

49
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,210
natural resources that's got to be great

50
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,759
right the reality is the opposite is

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,070
true all of this gold cobalt and

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,979
especially coltan is actually a curse

53
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,000
for Congo

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,069
yes dear viewers Congo is one of the

55
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,020
poorest countries on the planet and

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,520
we're talking about what's called the

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
absolute poverty line most of the

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,630
population lives on less than one dollar

59
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,620
a day

60
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,230
starvation is fairly common and guerilla

61
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,050
warfare is so common in the country that

62
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,180
it's no longer newsworthy but you

63
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,879
already know this the question is why

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,099
and the answer is a combination of all

65
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,290
of the bad things we usually mention

66
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,599
here on visual politic Wars bad

67
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,720
governance corruption and of course

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,980
colonialism imagine all of this on a

69
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,390
massive scale and you have a good

70
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,730
high-level picture of the Congo okay so

71
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,870
maybe that's where we could end today's

72
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,310
video and I could thank you all for

73
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,010
watching and ask you to subscribe I mean

74
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,549
that's why Congo is so poor right and a

75
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,049
story but you probably looked at that

76
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:57,760
little red bar below this video and

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
realize they were not done quite yet

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,810
because the case of the Congo is unique

79
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,579
in history we can't even compare it with

80
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,730
other African nation

81
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,400
so if you are a regular viewer of this

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,480
channel you know they're going to cover

83
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,129
all of the details about this country

84
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,530
including the results of their latest

85
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,900
elections so the question now is well

86
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,629
why is Congo so poor why do we say that

87
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,580
the natural resources are in fact a

88
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,340
curse and the most important question of

89
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,130
all can their brand-new president left

90
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,170
this curse well today we're going to

91
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,269
answer all of these questions but before

92
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,890
we do let's take a look back at the

93
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:40,069
history how to privatize a country in

94
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,560
the year 1877 king leopold ii of belgium

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,620
bought the congo and yes you heard that

96
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,880
right usually when we talk about

97
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,890
colonization we mean a country

98
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,079
conquering another one and this is where

99
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,760
there's the first unique thing about our

100
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,739
story today what we know today as the

101
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,810
Congo was a land with many tribes and

102
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,450
the lands with a huge potential to grow

103
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,400
rubber at this time in history rubber

104
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,780
was in high demand

105
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,760
King Leopold ii he looked at this

106
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,560
opportunity with dollar signs in his

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,380
eyes and said why conquer a country when

108
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:16,010
you can bias you see this was a

109
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,959
different time and back then European

110
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,489
powers thought they could do pretty much

111
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,380
anything they wanted in Africa on the

112
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,880
one hand it was a source of wealth to be

113
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,610
exploited and on the other they thought

114
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,900
colonization was kind of a matter of

115
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,150
charity they wanted to export European

116
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,840
values and civilization to a land of

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,300
barbarity this is why leopold ii created

118
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,250
the International African Association an

119
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,860
organization led by him that allowed him

120
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,690
to go to Congo and create his own

121
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,170
factories and plantations

122
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,310
since the Congolese people had no

123
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,620
private property label ii could take

124
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,180
over the land without any kind of

125
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,590
contract of course in order to

126
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,810
legitimize this looting Leopold the

127
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,700
seconds the king of a respectable

128
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,950
country like Belgium claims he would

129
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,320
turn this free state of Congo into a

130
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,530
civilized place the Congo Free State is

131
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,780
unique in its kind it has nothing to

132
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,180
hide and no secrets and is not beholden

133
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,090
to anyone except its founder Leopold the

134
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,580
second king of Belgium reality though

135
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,400
was way different leopold ii wanted to

136
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,710
get as much rubber as possible so he

137
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,020
enslaved the population and forced them

138
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,030
to reach production quotas if they

139
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,740
didn't he would chop off one of their

140
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,110
hands this is how one of the worst

141
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,140
genocides in all of history started it's

142
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,780
comparable in relative terms - mouths

143
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,120
Cultural Revolution the massacre was so

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,580
terrible even other colonial powers such

145
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,650
as the United Kingdom denounced Leopold

146
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,719
for his atrocities

147
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,519
and if you want to know more about this

148
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,139
I've got a video about King Leopold the

149
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,909
seconds on my other channel by a

150
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,379
graphics I'm going to link to that below

151
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,779
but let's move on with today's story

152
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,089
after leopold ii died he passed his

153
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,799
property over to the state of belgium

154
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,529
this is how congo became a colony in its

155
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,119
own right Belgium's government was

156
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,159
little more compassionate than the king

157
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,899
but still the Congolese they were kept

158
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,789
in slave-like conditions you see

159
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,319
colonialism is one of the most

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,779
despicable practices in history but if

161
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,909
there is one colonial power that was big

162
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,939
on brutality it would be Belgium and if

163
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,649
you want to be even more angry let me

164
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,329
tell you that to this day there are

165
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,669
monuments buildings and streets in

166
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:37,739
Brussels dedicated to leopold ii but the

167
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:40,169
truth is in 1960 congo it got its

168
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:41,939
independence this doesn't mean things

169
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,349
got better for them though their first

170
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,899
president patrice lumumba was no big fan

171
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,610
of his former colonizers this is why

172
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,379
both france and belgium helped other

173
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,749
groups to overthrow and execute him

174
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,729
which is how mabu tous esses echoes

175
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,619
dictatorship started and the country

176
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,360
changed its name to Zaire

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,919
Mobutu is known as being one of the

178
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,349
bloodiest dictators in history but as we

179
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,629
often said visual politic Mobutu may

180
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,689
have been a son of a bitch at least he

181
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:12,020
was our son of a bitch

182
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,210
you know it was the Cold War and Congo

183
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,070
was an ally of the West so there was

184
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,260
always money to finance his army but

185
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,600
things that changed in the 1990s without

186
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,640
a USSR to be afraid of America stopped

187
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,470
supporting Mobutu and all of those

188
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,970
groups that he was oppressing they

189
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,020
rebelled against him

190
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,430
this is how the first Congolese civil

191
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,710
war started and the country got back its

192
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,720
current name this was a civil war that

193
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,700
led to a second civil war for a better

194
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,020
understanding of just how devastating

195
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,570
this conflict was the second Congolese

196
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,220
civil war is considered to be the

197
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,530
deadliest conflict after world war ii

198
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,900
with over 5 million deaths and countless

199
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,660
acts of torture mutilation and other

200
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,820
atrocities

201
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,980
but here's the worst thing the violence

202
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,890
it hasn't stopped in 2003 the war ended

203
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,960
since then Joseph Kabila has tried to be

204
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,670
a dictator who rules over the country

205
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,950
with an iron fist but let's be honest as

206
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,140
authoritarian and corrupt as he is he

207
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,460
can't control the country there are

208
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,260
guerrillas and looting from neighboring

209
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,190
countries all the time

210
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,420
so now you might be wondering what why

211
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,490
is there so much guerilla warfare

212
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,890
how can one country have so many armed

213
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,510
groups I mean how do I pay for the guns

214
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,650
well let's have a look shall we

215
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,070
coltan rush you know the Nokia 6110 this

216
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,360
was a phone that was launched at the end

217
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,890
of the 90s and it was one of the first

218
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,080
cell phones to reach a massive audience

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,840
it's the smallest Nokia phone ever made

220
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,580
weighing just 137 grams it's the perfect

221
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,890
size for your hand and your pocket

222
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,840
suddenly everybody had a mobile phone

223
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,430
and this meant more and more tantalum

224
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,350
was required to produce these phones

225
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,450
until that moment the main tantalum

226
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,520
producer had been Australia the problem

227
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,380
well getting that material was more

228
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,670
expensive than you might imagine

229
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,470
you see it's almost impossible to find

230
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,420
pure chemical elements in nature

231
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,240
in this case Australia had mines where

232
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,280
you could find some ore and after a

233
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,830
complex chemical process you'd get a bit

234
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,940
of tantalum out of it

235
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,920
but there is an easier way to obtain it

236
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,650
and I'm talking about coltan coltan is a

237
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,600
rock that contains a lot of tantalum and

238
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,970
it's very cheap to refine guess where

239
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,100
you can find the biggest coltan reserves

240
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,020
on the planet only yep they are in the

241
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,180
Congo basically Congo is the Saudi

242
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:33,140
Arabia of coltan it's plenty of it's

243
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,090
it's easy to extract and it's even

244
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,040
easier to refine in fact you don't even

245
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,870
need technology to get coltan you just

246
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,630
pick up a shovel and there you go this

247
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,030
is why thousands of Congolese joins the

248
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,130
coltan hunt and despite the high demand

249
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,290
tantalum became cheaper and cheaper but

250
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,510
wait just a second because this is just

251
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,890
the beginning remember the financial

252
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,260
crisis of 2008 well it also had some

253
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,580
consequences in Australia

254
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,970
[Music]

255
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,879
EAM closes what ghena tantalum mine this

256
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,889
mine was the world's main tantalum

257
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,869
producer its closure and the tantalum

258
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:10,329
prices skyrocketed it's hard to estimate

259
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,649
the market price for this material

260
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,509
because unlike oil there and no public

261
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,249
indexes but according to some

262
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,439
consultancy firms tantalum prices almost

263
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,839
doubled from one year to the next and

264
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,730
what was the consequence for the Congo

265
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,519
well yeah there was the coltan rush all

266
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,050
of a sudden everybody was willing to

267
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,420
sacrifice their lives for a fistful of

268
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,970
rocks and this is where warlords entered

269
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,360
the picture

270
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
most of the gorillas were financed by

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,139
selling coltan and the more they sold

272
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,369
the more violence

273
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,019
they became we're talking about such a

274
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,569
huge massacre that even America had to

275
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,840
pass a law for it

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,220
dodd-frank act becomes law basically the

278
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,449
dodd-frank law was meant to protect

279
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,339
consumers one of its sections referred

280
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,440
to so-called conflict minerals

281
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,630
one of these was tantalum according to

282
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,430
this law companies buying tans alone

283
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,810
should know where it comes from the

284
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,430
problem in a country like Congo it's

285
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,810
almost impossible to control the

286
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,880
traceability of a mineral especially

287
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,889
given that there are almost no mining

288
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,509
companies yeah we heard that right it's

289
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,819
mostly just common people going to the

290
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,980
countryside to extract rocks and sell

291
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,509
them to a man who will sell them to

292
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,550
another man and finally it ends up

293
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,620
inside of your mobile phone in many

294
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,420
cases random miners cross the border

295
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,459
exploit the mines and go back to Rwanda

296
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,529
to process it as you know Rwanda is a

297
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,630
country that's growing really fast and

298
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,000
offers much more security in legal

299
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,399
political and physical terms compared to

300
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,779
Congo and if you didn't already know

301
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,370
this here's another video we made a long

302
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,399
time ago telling that story in facts if

303
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,750
you want to know more about these kinds

304
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,339
of things you really should subscribe to

305
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:44,779
this channel in skeino hit that Bell

306
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,430
button so you don't miss any posts but

307
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,199
let's go back to our story many of you

308
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:50,389
might wonder since it's so profitable

309
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:52,970
why aren't any big companies mining it I

310
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,620
mean surely there must be incentives do

311
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,240
create companies that can mass-produce

312
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,850
coltan and the answer that is of all

313
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,120
their arms so why well there's an

314
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
example

315
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,180
because Congo coltan miner resumes

316
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,639
buying after output halt in this case

317
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,589
the Sun zu is one of the few Congolese

318
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:13,329
mining companies it was founded by a

319
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,680
Congolese senator that wanted to

320
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
industrialize mining instead of risking

321
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,970
lives to get coltan the sanzu wants to

322
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,709
use machines that way they can offer

323
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,089
better security for the workers and

324
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,309
extract a lot more minerals so well

325
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:25,959
what's the problem that first of all

326
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,170
this machinery is expensive and money is

327
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,019
seldom abundant in the Congo secondly

328
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,699
nobody's going to invest in a place

329
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:35,110
where corrupt politicians are going to

330
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,089
make your life impossible and if

331
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,980
politicians don't do it then some

332
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,110
gorillas will

333
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,930
[Music]

334
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,629
so well what happens then well David

335
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,790
invests in this industry and those who

336
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,930
do like bassoon Zoo

337
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,610
have to stop their production all the

338
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,860
time because of smugglers and warlords

339
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,230
and this is how we can understand the

340
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,959
vicious cycle of coltan the more demands

341
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,699
there is the more incentives there are

342
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:01,800
for warlords to exploit it and the more

343
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,050
warlords we have exploiting coltan the

344
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,179
less incentives there are to create an

345
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:08,069
industry that would provide quality jobs

346
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:09,490
and create real wealth

[Music]

348
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,769
this is why despite the fact that half

349
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,170
of the tantalum on the planet comes from

350
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,870
this area Congo doesn't grow any faster

351
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,399
so now you might be wondering well is

352
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,940
anyone gonna challenge this well maybe

353
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,750
maybe not

354
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,470
you're gonna understand that in a second

355
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,019
the big fraud ramela Joseph Kabila the

356
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,450
Congolese dictator well in the year 2018

357
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,890
he had to resign and call for elections

358
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,750
in fact according to the Congolese

359
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,130
constitution he should have done it

360
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,290
before but you know dictators gonna

361
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,899
dictate as you might imagine 2018 could

362
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,170
not have been more rigged if it tried

363
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,420
Kabila's opponents only had one or two

364
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,240
electoral cabins citizens also had to

365
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,950
vote with tablets that nobody knew how

366
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,230
to use and as you might imagine no

367
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,089
international observer accepted this

368
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,579
process Congo - II you mind your own

369
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,980
business an election that's been delayed

370
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,380
for two years is about to be held and

371
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,600
the country has booted out the EU

372
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,459
ambassador alright so in this election

373
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,440
we had three main candidates rama's Oney

374
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,630
who is Kabila's successor feiyu Lu his

375
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,760
biggest opponents and cheeks ad the one

376
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
with the lowest chance of winning so

377
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,380
guess who won no it wasn't Rama Zoni the

378
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,020
winner was totally too scaly and here's

379
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,149
where the debate starts according to all

380
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:33,649
the organizations observing this process

381
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,450
including the Catholic Church the

382
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,670
process couldn't have been dirtier

383
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,550
[Music]

384
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,860
many analysts say the kabila knew nobody

385
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,050
would accept his successor so he let a

386
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,060
moderate enemy win somebody who at the

387
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,070
least would let capella keep his fortune

388
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,930
because make no mistake despite Congress

389
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,330
poverty kabila is a millionaire then

390
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,250
again Donald Trump has supported seasick

391
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,500
ad even if it's Sony to guarantee some

392
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,210
kind of stable government for the Congo

393
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,100
so now the question is can this brand

394
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,870
new president actually changed things

395
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,150
while the truth is that he does have

396
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,240
opportunities lithium and tantalum new

397
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,340
Australian production from Pilbara

398
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,230
basically the Australians have found a

399
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,360
new way to extract tantalum more cheaply

400
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,520
so they've reopens their mine so what

401
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,100
does this mean well less of a coltan

402
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,050
Rush less money for the Warlord's and

403
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,390
more incentives to create an ethical and

404
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,040
sustainable industry on the other hand

405
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,900
Rwanda Kongos neighboring country has

406
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,340
been developing its own coltan

407
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,770
processing industry in 2018 they created

408
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,600
a big factory to produce tantalum and

409
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,070
they've even begun experimenting with

410
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,810
blockchain technology to guarantee the

411
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,070
traceability of the tantalum this means

412
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,080
it will now be easier to know where our

413
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,880
tantalum comes from so now this new

414
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,440
Congolese government can partner with

415
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,780
Rwanda to create a coltan industry that

416
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,520
generates jobs and growth but here's a

417
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,200
question for you do you think of the

418
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,090
Congolese government will be willing to

419
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,220
do so is this brand new president is

420
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,500
going to end the rampant corruption in

421
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,240
order to help his country escape poverty

422
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,520
or or will we continue to see Congo as

423
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,290
poor as always despite its enormous

424
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,120
natural wealth well please leave your
