15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,450
with an initial exchange rate of 1.1

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,370
seven eight nine dollars the euro was

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:52,489
born on the 1st of January 1999

18
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,040
it again to operate as an electronic

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,960
currency used in financial markets and

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,160
for cashless payments

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,900
however it wouldn't be until three years

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,390
later that is at the beginning of 2002

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,640
when the euro coins and notes that we

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,770
know today began to circulate it all

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,810
started a decade earlier on January the

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,390
1st 1991 when 11 member countries of the

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,220
European Union decided to integrate

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,140
their local currencies currencies such

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,020
as the mark franc lira or pasetta under

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,940
the supervising umbrella of the European

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,280
Central Bank and with that the euro era

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,900
began

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,090

de la moneda literally and it's so in

38
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,720
style expectations were absolutely huge

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,670
perhaps no one showed more confidence in

40
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,350
this new currency than the European

41
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,540
Commissioner for Monetary Affairs Eve to

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:05,080
both the euro was suppressed monetary

43
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,700
instability reduced the cost of

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,230
companies and guarantee low and stable

45
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,790
interest rates today nobody would

46
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,380
imagine the United States with 50

47
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,970
currencies the dollar has made this

48
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,620
country strong the euro will make

49
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,390
Europe's voice heard louder all over the

50
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,620
world which will allow it to better

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,420
defend its interests which go far beyond

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,730
purely monetary ones if de veau European

[Music]

55
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,100
since then 20 years have passed a time

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,840
in which the new European currency has

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,000
gone through both good and bad times

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,280
which means on many occasions the euro

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,890
has been a big topic of public debate

60
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,600
because folks we can't deny the news is

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,690
notoriously pessimistic catastrophes and

62
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,850
bad news draw more attention than

63
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,810
positive events it's easy to believe

64
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,420
that the latest news supersedes any slow

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,700
and steady trend so in recent years

66
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,590
we've all been hearing all kinds of

67
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,300
theories about what the euro is meant

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,280
and forecasts about the currencies

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,900
future surely you must have heard at

70
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,850
some point that the euro is doomed or

71
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,470
that its arrival led to winning and

72
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,240
losing countries within the eurozone

73
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,880
well what's the truth what assessment

74
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,650
can we make of the 20 years that the

75
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,870
euro has been part of most Europeans

76
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,570
daily lives and what challenges does it

77
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,980
face

78
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,790
[Music]

79
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,810
well thanks to these supportin

80
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,700
sponsorship of the European Central Bank

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,320
some of visual politics team members we

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,660
travel to Frankfurt to seek answers to

83
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,460
those questions and celebrate the 20th

84
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,480
anniversary of the European currency

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:50,720
[Music]

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,030
the European Central Bank is therefore

87
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,970
to have Europeans to be able to spend

88
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,490
their money to invest it to borrow money

89
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,620
with confidence we want to make sure

90
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,440
that money is stable and that the banks

91
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,800
or people that the money in are safe

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,030
[Music]

93
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,190
in this video we're gonna try and find

94
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,140
out what the euro has meant into what

95
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,029
challenges it faces so let's get into it

96
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:24,660
[Music]

97
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,840
unity is strength

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,419
I think the first question we need to

99
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,150
ask ourselves is quite clear how and why

100
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,340
did the euro emerge to answer this

101
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,900
question we need to go back to the

102
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,639
nineteen eighties a decade that wasn't

103
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,020
particularly good for Europeans at that

104
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,240
time Europe's economy was not having a

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,889
great time these were years of

106
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,350
stagnation and bad statistics for

107
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,940
example unemployment in the European

108
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,650
communities countries that practically

109
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,260
doubles going from 5.8 percent in 1980

110
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,490
to over 11 percent just five years later

111
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,039
potential growth have decreased by 3

112
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,990
points public deficits at the guns who

113
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,180
emerge with levels above 3% and to make

114
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,039
matters worse the United States one of

115
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,660
the main destinations for European

116
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,550
exports was heavily increasing its

117
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,319
restrictions on imports

118
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,599
well it was in this context that the

119
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,629
idea of building a true common market

120
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,129
emerged something that would allow

121
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,379
European nations to boost trade and

122
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,300
subsequently strengthen their economic

123
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,729
growth the idea was to create a market

124
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,800
without barriers without customs without

125
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,110
tariffs without restrictions for all

126
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,119
goods to do so all administrative

127
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,860
obstacles would have to be eliminated

128
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,449
and the disparity between rules and

129
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,680
regulations had to be ended if a product

130
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,599
could be sold in one country of the

131
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:48,159
Union it could be sold in any of them

132
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,689
but not only that a genuine common

133
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,069
market had to work with the same

134
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,229
currency and with the same monetary

135
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,909
policy among other things this would

136
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,499
prevent countries competing with each

137
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,659
other by devaluing their respective

138
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,639
currencies over and over again and that

139
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,289
was quite common in those times for

140
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,529
example between 1979 and 1992 alone

141
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,139
Italy devalued the lira seven times yep

142
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,689
that's right in 13 years they had seven

143
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:14,260
devaluations

144
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:28,290
[Applause]

145
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,510
the idea was to create a single market

146
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,550
that would be as large and as

147
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,870
competitive as that of the United States

148
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,710
and to help rebuild Europe after the war

149
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,360
now that went well

150
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,180
things were moved moved ahead but then

151
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,820
you realize that each country having

152
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,340
their own currency is in fact a barrier

153
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,700
to their deeper integration and

154
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,810
Europeans have been trying all sorts of

155
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,000
things to make sure that competitive

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,940
devaluations where one country makes a

157
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,090
big effort to be competitive and so on

158
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,580
gets undone by a valued devaluation of

159
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,320
another country and they've tried that

160
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,140
through various means the European

161
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,700
monetary system and so on so forth and

162
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,560
in comes the idea of monetary union

163
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,340
again a gigantic revolutionary idea

164
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,080
thinking completely outside the box

165
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
Europeans said that's not fixed exchange

166
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,050
rates let's do away with exchange rate

167
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,150
altogether let's have one currency a

168
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:33,980
single currency

169
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,780
and what's more setting a common

170
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,460
currency which make trade between

171
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,320
European countries a lot easier

172
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,090
companies that no longer have to look at

173
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,340
exchange rates monetary policy decisions

174
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,320
from different governments or currency

175
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,180
risk hedges among many other issues

176
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,830
[Music]

177
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,409
and you know what the creation of the

178
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,330
single market has been a clear example

179
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,000
of success it simply has fulfilled its

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,370
objective inter-community exports have

181
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,800
moved from representing 13% of the

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,620
European Union's GDP in 1992 to more

183
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,840
than 20% today and the volume of intra

184
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,310
community investments is also

185
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,530
skyrocketed

186
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:25,870
[Music]

187
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,580
and in all honesty throughout this

188
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,949
entire process the euro has played a key

189
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,080
role the euro has now been with us for

190
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,419
20 years so what conclusions can we draw

191
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,520
well has it been good or bad for

192
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,830

00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,019
folks Europe has changed a lot in the

200
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,390
last 20 years in some cases for good

201
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,420
ends in some cases for well not so good

202
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,890
but at this point let me ask you a

203
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,990
question what do you think do you think

204
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,880
the euro has been good or bad for Europe

205
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,190
well folks with data in hands I think we

206
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,350
can say that in general its influence

207
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,760
has been positive we've talked about

208
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
this a lot it previously on visual

209
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,180
politic but the question it really has

210
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,930
to be how positive has the change bin

211
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:31,490
[Music]

212
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,220
money has always been a language drinks

213
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,250
to to express value how much do you

214
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,850
value something these days there's 340

215
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,890
million Europeans who only have one

216
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,500
common language to express how much is

217
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,630
the thing is worth to them and that's in

218
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,060
Europe even if we speak different

219
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,550
languages our language of expressing

220
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,279
value is the euro and that kind of

221
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,160
brings us together and and that's a true

222
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,950
a true benefit a further benefit will be

223
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,650
if you go abroad if you go I don't know

224
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,050
to Bangkok and you give your rickshaw

225
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,600

226
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,700
that's an interesting thing I will take

227
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,180
that these days if you go to Bangkok or

228
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,850
you go to Istanbul and you hand out the

229
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,100
five euro note people will gladly take

230
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,810

231
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,940
international currency that wouldn't

232
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,130
have happened with the peseta I would

233
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,470
assume in the old days we have created a

234
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,990
currency that is stable where inflation

235
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,970
is low and where there's a an

236
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,420
environment of of stability and

237
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,690

opinion of the currency can think that

282
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,970
it's generally been positive and let's

283
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,040
not kid ourselves it isn't strange for

284
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480

difficult the global financial crisis

297
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,209
caused a list of problems in most

such as Greece Italy Ireland Spain or

301
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,670
Portugal clearly that's when the idea of

302
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,770
to Europe's emerged on the one hand were

303
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,240
these central and northern European

304
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,040

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,200
high productivity indexes competitive

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,330
industries and relatively responsible

307
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,750
leadership and on the other hand we had

308
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,250
countries that historically attempted to

309
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,230
compete by devaluing their currencies

310
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,180
when this option was ruled out due to

311
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,630
the euro

312
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,279
they had boosted domestic demands

313
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,260
through strong imbalances in their

314
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,060
payments balance in other words they

315
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,860
financed most of their spending via

316
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,959
consumption and investments with funding

317
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,180
from abroad basically from northern and

318
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,590
central European countries

319
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,140
and this money was largely concentrated

320
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,030
in the real estate sector we're talking

321
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,410
about countries where the local

322
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,760
governments didn't implement any

323
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,710
structural reforms that would allow them

324
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,420
to be more competitive and whose banks

325
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,160
were overloaded with loans linked to the

326
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,050
real estate bubble loans that of course

327
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,730
lost a lot of their value when this

328
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,770
bubble burst which obviously put the

329
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:26,000
banks against the wall Greece Portugal

330
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,220
Spain and Ireland's or their islands

331
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,590
cases a bit different required some form

332
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,720
of financial assistance at that time the

333
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,910
distrust and problems were so huge that

334
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,020
because he might have heard there was

335
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,240
speculation about the possible rupture

336
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,100
of the Euro among other things because

337
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,810
many European states have to pay such

338
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,790
high premiums that their situation was

339
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,920
made completely unstable they simply

340
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,830
could not finance themselves in the end

341
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,330
the member countries of the eurozone

342
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,130
decided to do everything they could to

343
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,440
avoid that scenario and it was then that

344
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,240
the European Central Bank President

345
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,340
Mario Draghi pronounced these famous

346
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,270
words on July the 26th 2012 within our

347
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,730
mandate the ECB is ready to do whatever

348
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,590
it takes to preserve the euro and

349
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,020
believe me it will be enough

350
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,330
Mario Draghi this meant that the

351
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,740
European Central Bank would adopt

352
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,930
extraordinary measures to stabilize the

353
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,610
euro had started to give a longer term

354
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,770
loans to banks to buy a range of assets

355
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,630
from banks including government bonds

356
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,460
and corporate bonds so that businesses

357
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,380
and people were able to borrow more and

358
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,230
spend less to repay their debts this has

359
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,400
led to more economic growth and

360
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:53,910
inflation

361
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,009
I think the harvest time for the euro

362
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,730
was when the crisis which was initially

363
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,699
an economic crisis a financial crisis a

364
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,240
banking crisis turned into a crisis of

365
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,209
trust at crisis of confidence from

366
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:13,199
people lost confidence that the euro as

367
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,449
a project is a good thing the euro will

368
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:19,440
survive that countries will do the right

369
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,040
thing

370
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,649
to stay in the euro when people started

371
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,649
doubting that that was I think the

372
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,139
hardest moment because to lose trust and

373
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,569
confidence is very quick to rebuild it

374
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:36,589
is very hard

375
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,629
if you go out and ask people in the

376
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,339
financial markets there were certainly

377
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,110
some people who thought the euro would

378
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,629
disappear some might even be looking

379
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,610
forward to it because an opportunity to

380
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,149
make money often forgetting what

381
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,059
catastrophic responses consequences than

382
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:55,910
would have had and maybe also if you ask

383
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,579
people in the streets feeding being fed

384
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,850
some of the of the media commentary had

385
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,100
had had doubts about it if you read a

386
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,059
headline the euros got 10 days to live

387
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,760
that you had in some some papers then it

388
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,709
is natural the people start to wonder

389
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,230
whether this is really solid but was

390
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,429
most important in this is that exposed

391
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,610
people have seen that yes if push comes

392
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,829
to shove the Europeans get their act

393
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,900
together and they will do what is

394
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,840
necessary or in the words represent

395
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,559
whatever it takes to make sure the euro

396
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,360
will survive

397
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
I think there is an understanding that

398
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,230
we haven't done all the jobs that we

399
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,029
need to do that we've done the good

400
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,159
progress you make good progress but

401
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,960
there's more to do the completion of

402
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,019
banking union is one thing the the

403
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,090
working on what we call a capital

404
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,399
markets union is a very important point

405
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:02,450
and there are the other elements

406
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,679
economic union and all the way to a

407
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,559
deeper political union and say how do we

408
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,700
make sure that's the benefits of the

409
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,529
single currency which are there or

410
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,350
shared equally and that everyone even

411
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,509
those in countries that have suffered

412
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:21,359
from the crisis fear yes this is a good

413
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,200
project that also helps me personally

414
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,879
[Music]

415
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,289
but folks at this point the question we

416
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:36,419
need to ask ourselves is this is the

417
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,850
eurozone really prepared to face a new

418
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,230
crisis what could happen in the future

419
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,809
if one of the euro member countries has

420
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,609
some problems well folks over the last

421
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:46,259
few years a lot of different mechanisms

422
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,539
have emerged and have been implemented

423
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,220
in order to strengthen the euros

424
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,230
resistance and I can tell you right now

425
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,359
that a lot of these things are a bit of

426
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,429
a mouthful for example we have the MIP

427
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:59,279
macro economic imbalance procedure and

428
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,950
the es RB the European systemic risk

429
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,989
board this is also the ESM the European

430
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,609
Stability Mechanism which has been

431
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,230
established among other things to

432
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,820
provide financial assistance to the

433
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,259
member countries if they need it

434
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,019
it can mobilize up to 500 billion euros

435
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:14,909
and has already been used to assist

436
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,340
greece and spain with their famous bank

437
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,850
bailouts

438
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,960
I think we've made good progress in

439
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,149
completing banking union that has three

440
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,460
pillars a single way of supervising

441
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,620
banks a single mechanism to make sure

442
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,679
banks on trouble and their failing that

443
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,659
we can resolve them what we're missing

444
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,700
is a third pillar is a common deposit

445
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,039
insurance can seem so that wherever you

446
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,769
put your money into the bank your

447
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:43,990
deposit is safe throughout regardless

448
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,509
which country in which bank that is to

449
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:48,190
make sure kind of a euro is a euro

450
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,380
wherever it is in which bank account it

451
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,350
is across the entire eurozone

452
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,660
[Music]

453
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,970
and that's not all existing institutions

454
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,620
such as the stability and growth pact

455
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,780
have also been reinforced it requires a

456
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,690
3% limit on public deficit and 60% on

457
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,730
public debt remember countries and also

458
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,650
by virtue of the fiscal stability treaty

459
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,900
almost all European Union countries have

460
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,280
included the requirements of having

461
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,500
balanced budgets throughout the cycle in

462
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,180
their national legislation

463
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,980
let's hope they respect their

464
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,600
legislation the European Central Bank

465
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,310
has also increased its capabilities to

466
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:34,309
deal with emergencies

467
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,710
in short as you see a lot of changes

468
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,789
have taken place with the aim of

469
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:40,129
reducing the risk of crisis and if

470
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,960
necessary limiting its impact the

471
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,759
question is are these measures is enough

472
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,830
or should we continue to move forward

473
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,019
for example with a fiscal Union and

474
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,700
right there folks is one of the great

475
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,669
debates that exists right now in Europe

476
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,350
hold on a second because crises aren't

477
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,360
the only challenges facing the European

478
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,250
Central Bank and the euro the arrival of

479
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,960
cryptocurrency and blockchain have also

480
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,059
raised questions these are will new

481
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,889
financial technologies be able to change

482
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:10,019
the way that money works do they pose a

483
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,610
threat to traditional currencies

484
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,559
blockchain is what we see as an

485
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,960
infrastructure so you can see it as a

486
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,539
road and and and a Bitcoin or other

487
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,909
crypto assets these are for us the cars

488
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,130
on the on the infrastructure in a very

489
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,809
simplified way we think that the

490
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,750
technology is promising and it's not yet

491
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,000
maybe ready for prime time for us but

492
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,639
it's not a threat it's more opportunity

493
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,649
so that's it on the infrastructure side

494
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:40,049
but then you have the the assets of

495
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,460
Bitcoin and so on I think a lot has been

496
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,470
said by by many central bankers around

497
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,799
the world of course crypto assets the

498
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,320
high volatility and they are not a

499
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,080
currency they are not money and our

500
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,820
president also recently said the euro

501
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,009
today is a euro tomorrow and with

502
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:57,659
Bitcoin maybe it's different because

503
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,879
there's no identifiable issuer there's

504
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:02,850
no one responsible behind the currency

505
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,180
making sure that it's that it's stable

506
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,580
[Music]

507
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,200
[Applause]

508
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,330
and well this brings us to another very

509
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,009
important question and that's what what

510
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:13,929
about cybersecurity especially in a

511
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:15,609
world where the storage of financial

512
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,350
records is digital and the only way to

513
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,269
access the information or perform a

514
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:24,299
transaction requires a digital device

515
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,859
it's a new form of warfare in many ways

516
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,409
so you also have threat actors you know

517
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:32,169
nations dayz hacktivist groups you know

518
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,269
script kiddies all of them that have

519
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,419
become more professional and more

520
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,190
persistent and better resourced to be

521
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,220
able to target the financial system why

522
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,080
does this matter to the European Central

523
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,440
Bank

524
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,960
well we ultimately have a mandate which

525
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,450
is around financial stability ensuring

526
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,840
confidence in the euro itself so if

527
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,269
there is a disruption to the financial

528
00:22:55,269 --> 00:22:58,330
system if the integrity of data is

529
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,149
compromised in the financial system then

530
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:03,549
it has a possible contagion effect right

531
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,820
across the financial system

532
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:14,000
[Music]

533
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,830
folks Europe is facing a lot of

534
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,510
challenges some of which we've already

535
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,740
talked about on this channel challenges

536
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,300
such as aging populations growing

537
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,610
international competition imbalances in

538
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,930
the public accounts of many of the

539
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,700
member countries or even defining

540
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,670
exactly what European model we all want

541
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,230
to follow

542
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,669
[Music]

543
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:39,739
the European Parliament elections will

544
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:41,929
take place from May the 23rd to May the

545
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,389
26th that depends on the country in

546
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,369
which you live in one way or another

547
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:48,529
this is the moment in which all European

548
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,599
citizens will have the chance to speak

549
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,999
out and decide what future we want for

550
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:55,669
Europe as what kind of Union we want so

551
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,889
