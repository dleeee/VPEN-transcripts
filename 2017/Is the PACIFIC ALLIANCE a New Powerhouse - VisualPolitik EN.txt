3
00:00:06.83 --> 00:00:11.010
every time a latin-american government

4
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.480
tries to discuss foreign policy and

5
00:00:11.01 --> 00:00:15.330
development they end up discussing

6
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:17.340
regional integration that is why we

7
00:00:15.33 --> 00:00:19.350
should understand the three main common

8
00:00:17.34 --> 00:00:21.810
features of all art in America football

9
00:00:19.35 --> 00:00:25.289
that soccer few Americans revolutions

10
00:00:21.81 --> 00:00:26.849
and the regional organizations seriously

11
00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.830
we're really not kidding here in the

12
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.199
last few decades there have been so many

13
00:00:28.83 --> 00:00:33.660
regional organizations that it is almost

14
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.790
impossible to know what goals each of

15
00:00:33.66 --> 00:00:37.230
them have besides obviously being an

16
00:00:35.79 --> 00:00:39.960
excuse for spending money on public

17
00:00:37.23 --> 00:00:42.180
workers headquarters and traveling

18
00:00:39.96 --> 00:00:44.910
these are UNICEF Mercosur al-baqarah

19
00:00:42.18 --> 00:00:46.800
COMSOL AK Aldi the MDM community seeker

20
00:00:44.91 --> 00:00:49.739
seller the Rio group and of course the

21
00:00:46.8 --> 00:00:51.210
Organization of American States and to

22
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.730
be honest I'm probably not even

23
00:00:51.21 --> 00:00:54.660
mentioning all of them there anyway once

24
00:00:53.73 --> 00:00:56.579
you hear about all of these

25
00:00:54.66 --> 00:00:58.559
organizations you might be thinking the

26
00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.570
Latin America is the place where people

27
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.340
get on with each other the best a place

28
00:01:00.57 --> 00:01:04.199
where it's really easy to do business

29
00:01:02.34 --> 00:01:05.909
among the different countries and where

30
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.580
governments work together for the common

31
00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.010
good in some sort of wonderful paradise

32
00:01:08.58 --> 00:01:12.710
right where all the bad news is if you

33
00:01:11.01 --> 00:01:15.000
didn't guess that none of that is true

34
00:01:12.71 --> 00:01:16.770
all of these organizations they were

35
00:01:15.0 --> 00:01:18.960
born with these really wonderful high

36
00:01:16.77 --> 00:01:21.000
ideas but we could say they all really

37
00:01:18.96 --> 00:01:24.570
did nothing for development and economic

38
00:01:21.0 --> 00:01:26.970
and political integration in Latin

39
00:01:24.57 --> 00:01:28.290
America new institutions are created but

40
00:01:26.97 --> 00:01:30.420
it isn't clear what to do with the

41
00:01:28.29 --> 00:01:32.460
previous ones it is an endless fight

42
00:01:30.42 --> 00:01:34.079
forward carlos Malamud

43
00:01:32.46 --> 00:01:36.990
look despite all the different processes

44
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.880
of integration trade is strangely low

45
00:01:36.99 --> 00:01:42.250
among these different countries

46
00:01:39.88 --> 00:01:44.229
the numbers are important here the share

47
00:01:42.25 --> 00:01:46.570
of exports inside the region it hasn't

48
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.400
changed much and it has been around 20%

49
00:01:46.57 --> 00:01:50.320
which is much lower than in other parts

50
00:01:48.4 --> 00:01:52.270
of the world this is pretty strong

51
00:01:50.32 --> 00:01:56.060
evidence about how artificial and

52
00:01:52.27 --> 00:01:59.200
unproductive these organizations are

53
00:01:56.06 --> 00:01:59.200
[Music]

54
00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.859
we will see the details of this case

55
00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.719
though the word disappointment or

56
00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.909
failure would probably better describe

57
00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.500
Mercosur but I can already tell you that

58
00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.509
it is very possible that this lack of

59
00:02:08.5 --> 00:02:12.489
real integration is the origin of some

60
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.500
of the most important problems that the

61
00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:21.790
region is facing the eternal promise

62
00:02:19.5 --> 00:02:24.250
Latin America is do viewers it's a

63
00:02:21.79 --> 00:02:25.989
fantastic region it's got great natural

64
00:02:24.25 --> 00:02:28.599
resources it has significant

65
00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.069
biodiversity and its climate is varied

66
00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.810
and impressive many people would say

67
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.769
that the region is one of the most

68
00:02:31.81 --> 00:02:34.769
beautiful on earth

69
00:02:38.34 --> 00:02:42.870
however economically speaking things are

70
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:44.880
not looking so great despite all of

71
00:02:42.87 --> 00:02:47.280
these magnificent resources and its

72
00:02:44.88 --> 00:02:49.440
great potential the region has been left

73
00:02:47.28 --> 00:02:51.720
behind in terms of economic growth let's

74
00:02:49.44 --> 00:02:53.760
compare for example the current richest

75
00:02:51.72 --> 00:02:56.160
country in Latin America and that would

76
00:02:53.76 --> 00:02:57.480
be Chile so I think most people would

77
00:02:56.16 --> 00:02:59.130
agree here that Chile's done a pretty

78
00:02:57.48 --> 00:03:01.620
good job in the last few decades right

79
00:02:59.13 --> 00:03:03.520
well despite that apparent progress just

80
00:03:01.62 --> 00:03:11.000
have a look at this chart

81
00:03:03.52 --> 00:03:13.530
[Music]

82
00:03:11.0 --> 00:03:14.940
now here we have taken the richest

83
00:03:13.53 --> 00:03:17.250
country in Latin America and they've

84
00:03:14.94 --> 00:03:18.990
compared it to South Korea which is not

85
00:03:17.25 --> 00:03:21.480
even the richest country in eastern Asia

86
00:03:18.99 --> 00:03:24.209
bands well the difference is pretty

87
00:03:21.48 --> 00:03:26.340
obvious in the 60s Chile was a poor

88
00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.850
country but was far richer than South

89
00:03:26.34 --> 00:03:37.410
Korea they well things they're rather

90
00:03:29.85 --> 00:03:39.060
different we can also look at Argentina

91
00:03:37.41 --> 00:03:41.190
which was once the richest country in

92
00:03:39.06 --> 00:03:43.290
Latin America with the exception of Cuba

93
00:03:41.19 --> 00:03:52.200
but now take a look at its evolution

94
00:03:43.29 --> 00:03:53.640
when compared to Spain well one of the

95
00:03:52.2 --> 00:03:55.769
causes for this lower growth might

96
00:03:53.64 --> 00:03:57.600
precisely be the low trade integration

97
00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.820
and the excess protectionism and

98
00:03:57.6 --> 00:04:01.890
bureaucracy that the region has always

99
00:03:59.82 --> 00:04:03.480
suffered from I mean there are loads of

100
00:04:01.89 --> 00:04:05.070
agreements there are tons of committees

101
00:04:03.48 --> 00:04:06.090
and forums and all of that stuff but

102
00:04:05.07 --> 00:04:09.300
when the rubber hits the road

103
00:04:06.09 --> 00:04:11.220
there's really nothing there but do hold

104
00:04:09.3 --> 00:04:13.709
on for just one second because a few

105
00:04:11.22 --> 00:04:15.510
years ago a new integration project it

106
00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.209
was put into place and this one is

107
00:04:15.51 --> 00:04:20.310
actually completely different to the

108
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.440
rest not only is it the first project

109
00:04:20.31 --> 00:04:24.870
with real success in the region but it

110
00:04:22.44 --> 00:04:27.390
might also change the destiny of Latin

111
00:04:24.87 --> 00:04:31.080
America forever and here we're talking

112
00:04:27.39 --> 00:04:34.720
about the Pacific Alliance

113
00:04:31.08 --> 00:04:38.910
[Music]

114
00:04:34.72 --> 00:04:41.550
the Pacific Alliance

115
00:04:38.91 --> 00:04:43.830
in April of 2011 our friends Chile

116
00:04:41.55 --> 00:04:45.930
Colombia Mexico and Peru formed the so

117
00:04:43.83 --> 00:04:48.000
called Pacific Alliance its mission is

118
00:04:45.93 --> 00:04:50.550
to finally achieve an integration so the

119
00:04:48.0 --> 00:04:51.900
goods capital and people can move freely

120
00:04:50.55 --> 00:04:53.610
around the region

121
00:04:51.9 --> 00:04:54.980
all of this was put in place with the

122
00:04:53.61 --> 00:04:57.510
idea that it would stimulate growth

123
00:04:54.98 --> 00:05:02.040
development and competitiveness in these

124
00:04:57.51 --> 00:05:04.590
economies our countries account for 55%

125
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:06.510
of Latin American exports this is not a

126
00:05:04.59 --> 00:05:07.890
romantic integration of poetic

127
00:05:06.51 --> 00:05:10.080
integration it is a realistic

128
00:05:07.89 --> 00:05:12.960
integration before the world and to the

129
00:05:10.08 --> 00:05:13.350
world Alan Garcia former president of

130
00:05:12.96 --> 00:05:15.990
Peru

131
00:05:13.35 --> 00:05:17.970
man so they did even though there's

132
00:05:15.99 --> 00:05:19.590
still a lot of work to be done since

133
00:05:17.97 --> 00:05:26.910
then developments it's been really

134
00:05:19.59 --> 00:05:29.400
significant in only six years these four

135
00:05:26.91 --> 00:05:30.660
countries have removed 92 percent of

136
00:05:29.4 --> 00:05:32.550
custom tariffs and they've set a

137
00:05:30.66 --> 00:05:34.140
deadline to remove all of the rest as

138
00:05:32.55 --> 00:05:35.910
well along with this they've simplified

139
00:05:34.14 --> 00:05:37.830
the bureaucracy of customs and

140
00:05:35.91 --> 00:05:40.530
administration especially when it comes

141
00:05:37.83 --> 00:05:42.930
to rules about the origin of goods this

142
00:05:40.53 --> 00:05:47.160
was previously a significant burden on

143
00:05:42.93 --> 00:05:49.350
the region all right so up until now if

144
00:05:47.16 --> 00:05:51.360
a Colombian producer used Peruvian

145
00:05:49.35 --> 00:05:52.830
supplies he couldn't take advantage of

146
00:05:51.36 --> 00:05:55.380
the free trade agreements between

147
00:05:52.83 --> 00:06:00.300
Colombia and Mexico when selling his

148
00:05:55.38 --> 00:06:01.590
goods to Mexico which is just crazy but

149
00:06:00.3 --> 00:06:02.760
that's not the end of it visa

150
00:06:01.59 --> 00:06:05.010
requirements they've also been

151
00:06:02.76 --> 00:06:07.740
eliminated so the movements of visitors

152
00:06:05.01 --> 00:06:09.320
has actually doubled and then and this

153
00:06:07.74 --> 00:06:11.760
is very important there have been

154
00:06:09.32 --> 00:06:13.830
significant advances in financial

155
00:06:11.76 --> 00:06:16.770
integration these four countries have

156
00:06:13.83 --> 00:06:18.870
created the mi la the American

157
00:06:16.77 --> 00:06:21.150
integrated market which is meant to be

158
00:06:18.87 --> 00:06:23.320
the largest stock market in Latin

159
00:06:21.15 --> 00:06:24.690

[Music]

161
00:06:24.69 --> 00:06:27.960
and all there's more among other

162
00:06:26.61 --> 00:06:29.820
initiatives the countries in the

163
00:06:27.96 --> 00:06:31.890
Alliance are working together in order

164
00:06:29.82 --> 00:06:33.420
to be known in international markets

165
00:06:31.89 --> 00:06:35.220
they have also started to share

166
00:06:33.42 --> 00:06:37.230
embassies in African and Asian countries

167
00:06:35.22 --> 00:06:39.600
and they have decided to negotiate all

168
00:06:37.23 --> 00:06:40.680
together for their free trade agreements

169
00:06:39.6 --> 00:06:42.270
for example they've actually already

170
00:06:40.68 --> 00:06:45.900
started to do this with New Zealand

171
00:06:42.27 --> 00:06:48.060
Australia Canada and Singapore Australia

172
00:06:45.9 --> 00:06:49.950
and New Zealand start trade talks with

173
00:06:48.06 --> 00:06:52.260
Pacific Alliance in other words these

174
00:06:49.95 --> 00:06:54.720
four countries are building step-by-step

175
00:06:52.26 --> 00:06:56.730
a unique market which will be rather

176
00:06:54.72 --> 00:06:58.710
significance we're talking about two

177
00:06:56.73 --> 00:07:00.840
hundred and fourteen million consumers

178
00:06:58.71 --> 00:07:03.330
here with a combined GDP which makes

179
00:07:00.84 --> 00:07:04.950
this alliance one of the eight largest

180
00:07:03.33 --> 00:07:07.960
economies in the world

181
00:07:04.95 --> 00:07:10.569
[Music]

182
00:07:07.96 --> 00:07:13.360
this is an economy that represents 50%

183
00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:16.180
of all exports and more than 40% of all

184
00:07:13.36 --> 00:07:17.979
foreign investment in Latin America we

185
00:07:16.18 --> 00:07:20.139
could say that if the Pacific Alliance

186
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.030
keeps it up in a very short time we

187
00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.160
might have to consider it the biggest

188
00:07:22.03 --> 00:07:26.319
power in Latin America but in order to

189
00:07:24.16 --> 00:07:28.120
understand a bit better the achievements

190
00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.889
that they've had in only six years we

191
00:07:28.12 --> 00:07:33.630
should look at the other large group in

192
00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:38.889
the region and that would be Marcus or

193
00:07:33.63 --> 00:07:41.400
the downfall of Mercosur Marcus or it

194
00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:44.110
was created in 1991 by Brazil Argentina

195
00:07:41.4 --> 00:07:47.050
Uruguay and Paraguay with the intention

196
00:07:44.11 --> 00:07:49.330
of creating one large integrated market

197
00:07:47.05 --> 00:07:51.940
well these were ambitious goals that the

198
00:07:49.33 --> 00:07:53.919
advances have been pretty damn modest

199
00:07:51.94 --> 00:07:55.900
and how about some evidence of this well

200
00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:57.789
just have a look at this the trade among

201
00:07:55.9 --> 00:08:00.520
Mercosur our members represents today

202
00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:03.370
less than 13% of the total trade of its

203
00:08:00.52 --> 00:08:07.870
members in 1995 that was almost 20

204
00:08:03.37 --> 00:08:09.580
percent so rather than encouraging trade

205
00:08:07.87 --> 00:08:12.039
between its members we could say that

206
00:08:09.58 --> 00:08:14.320
Marcos or has actually weakened them in

207
00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:16.930
the last few years Marcos orb has become

208
00:08:14.32 --> 00:08:18.310
some sort of protectionist shield rather

209
00:08:16.93 --> 00:08:20.650
than something which is working to

210
00:08:18.31 --> 00:08:22.120
integrate these countries further not

211
00:08:20.65 --> 00:08:25.509
exactly what they wanted in the first

212
00:08:22.12 --> 00:08:28.120
place the group has become little more

213
00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:29.409
than an anti gringo talking shop but why

214
00:08:28.12 --> 00:08:31.300
isn't this working

215
00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:33.190
well that's mainly because the countries

216
00:08:31.3 --> 00:08:35.500
they're not really very committed in

217
00:08:33.19 --> 00:08:37.510
theory Marcos or is a process of

218
00:08:35.5 --> 00:08:39.969
economic integration but there are so

219
00:08:37.51 --> 00:08:41.620
many exceptions and restrictions that in

220
00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:44.229
the end there's no free movement of

221
00:08:41.62 --> 00:08:46.149
goods or services America saw has become

222
00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:48.610
something which is totally ineffective

223
00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:50.980
look a good example can be found on the

224
00:08:48.61 --> 00:08:52.959
border of Argentina and Uruguay in

225
00:08:50.98 --> 00:08:55.089
theory the goods should be able to move

226
00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:57.339
freely between both countries however

227
00:08:55.089 --> 00:08:58.959
the reality is totally different when

228
00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:00.970
adding customs inspections and

229
00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:03.370
bureaucracy a truck from Uruguay to

230
00:09:00.97 --> 00:09:06.070
Argentina could be delayed for more than

231
00:09:03.37 --> 00:09:09.240
24 hours which is totally crazy when

232
00:09:06.07 --> 00:09:12.310
it's supposed to not be delayed at all

233
00:09:09.24 --> 00:09:14.649
all of this has led to Uruguay formally

234
00:09:12.31 --> 00:09:16.810
asking to become a member of the Pacific

235
00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:18.850
Alliance and there is more to this story

236
00:09:16.81 --> 00:09:20.980
still the political change in Argentina

237
00:09:18.85 --> 00:09:23.200
and Brazil has led to both of their

238
00:09:20.98 --> 00:09:25.180
governments accepting that burkas or at

239
00:09:23.2 --> 00:09:29.320
least as it is understood today is

240
00:09:25.18 --> 00:09:31.300
almost completely worthless will never

241
00:09:29.32 --> 00:09:33.160
reach the common market the custom union

242
00:09:31.3 --> 00:09:34.839
is completely destroyed and the free

243
00:09:33.16 --> 00:09:37.930
trade area is not working either

244
00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:40.180
Mercosur is in a dying State Danny Louis

245
00:09:37.93 --> 00:09:42.640
story Minister of Economy in Uruguay

246
00:09:40.18 --> 00:09:44.890
this is why Macri has decided to become

247
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:46.690
closer to the Pacific Alliance and look

248
00:09:44.89 --> 00:09:48.490
for ties between both processes of

249
00:09:46.69 --> 00:09:50.649
integration the real question becomes

250
00:09:48.49 --> 00:09:52.839
now will the Pacific Alliance create a

251
00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.579
change in Marcos or if it does then that

252
00:09:52.839 --> 00:10:02.550
would be great news for the entire

253
00:09:54.579 --> 00:10:02.550
region the Pacific boomers

254
00:10:03.62 --> 00:10:08.220
and now of course the question that we

255
00:10:06.39 --> 00:10:10.020
have to ask is well why is the Pacific

256
00:10:08.22 --> 00:10:12.450
Alliance unlike any of those other

257
00:10:10.02 --> 00:10:14.580
organizations the only one that seems to

258
00:10:12.45 --> 00:10:16.500
be working well maybe this has to do

259
00:10:14.58 --> 00:10:19.500
with the so-called Pacific coomer's

260
00:10:16.5 --> 00:10:21.210
Chile Peru Colombia and Mexico these

261
00:10:19.5 --> 00:10:23.790
countries have been the most dynamic

262
00:10:21.21 --> 00:10:25.710
economies in Latin America and they

263
00:10:23.79 --> 00:10:27.180
share the same vision they all agree

264
00:10:25.71 --> 00:10:29.310
that in order to grow and develop they

265
00:10:27.18 --> 00:10:31.050
have to produce and do business with the

266
00:10:29.31 --> 00:10:33.510
rest of the world and this is why

267
00:10:31.05 --> 00:10:35.430
according to the World Bank these humans

268
00:10:33.51 --> 00:10:37.110
are the country where it is easiest to

269
00:10:35.43 --> 00:10:38.850
do business or where more trade

270
00:10:37.11 --> 00:10:39.190
agreements assigned with the rest of the

271
00:10:38.85 --> 00:10:47.960
world

272
00:10:39.19 --> 00:10:50.300
[Music]

273
00:10:47.96 --> 00:10:52.100
anyway the Pacific Alliance represents

274
00:10:50.3 --> 00:10:54.020
one of the best opportunities for Latin

275
00:10:52.1 --> 00:10:56.300
American to be in a position to become

276
00:10:54.02 --> 00:10:57.920
the talk of the town it wouldn't even be

277
00:10:56.3 --> 00:10:59.660
too much of a stretch to say that we

278
00:10:57.92 --> 00:11:01.880
could be witnessing the birth of a great

279
00:10:59.66 --> 00:11:03.890
economic power but now it's your turn

280
00:11:01.88 --> 00:11:05.780
do you think Latin America has to bet on

281
00:11:03.89 --> 00:11:07.310
these processes of integration well
