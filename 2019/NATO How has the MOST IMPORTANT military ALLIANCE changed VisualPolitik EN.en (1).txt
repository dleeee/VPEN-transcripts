one of the most politically and

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,369
diplomatically significant crises that

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,110

traveled to Romania to learn more about

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,220
how this organization works it spoke to

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,930
some of the people in charge and to

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,360
witness native maneuvers live so don't

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,860
tell me that it's not a fitting way to

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,250

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,690
three videos in which we're going to get

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,190
to know this institution a little bit

27
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,810
better today we're going to see how it

28
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,250
works how it's changed over the years

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,930
and the challenges that it faces for the

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,479
years ahead so without further ado let's

31
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,340
crack on shall we on April the 4th 1949

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,920
the Treaty of the North Atlantic was

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,710
signed which led to NATO most important

34
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,180
military alliance of all time has

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,040
already sent throughout these 70 years

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,869
the organization has changed a lot but

37
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,240
most significantly it's grown you see it

38
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,610
was originally an agreement between just

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,920
12 countries and today it's got no less

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,899
than 29 members the United States Canada

41
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,780
Turkey and 26 other European states

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,520
including several former members of the

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,470
Warsaw Pact which was the former

44
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,270
military alliance formed between the

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,369
Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc

46
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,100
countries

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,110
[Music]

48
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,160
very soon the Republic of North

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,590
Macedonia will become the 30th member of

50
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,750
the organization folks we're talking

51
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,700
about an alliance that represents almost

52
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,010
1 billion people half of the world's

53
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,230
economic power and most of the world's

54
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,200
military spending

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,210
it's an organization with joint command

56
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,770
structures and troops that train

57
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,720
together to be able to respond to a

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,600
crisis in a coordinated manner

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,580
[Music]

60
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,800
this global defense alliance wields an

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,590
unprecedented amount of power so the 29

62
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,360
countries that currently constitute NATO

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,250
they have accumulated an annual military

64
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,190
spending of more than one trillion US

65
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,280
dollars that is almost 60% of all the

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,140
military spending that occurs in all

67
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,950
countries everywhere in the world but

68
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,600
hold on for just a moment despite having

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,040
most of the world's military spending

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,200
power and being bigger and more powerful

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,090
than ever before NATO isn't exactly

72
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,610
enjoying its golden era this is

73
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,260
something that we've already talked

74
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,540
about in several videos here on visual

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
politic well in this and two upcoming

76
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,050
videos we're going to explain what's

77
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,820
happening in town NATO has evolved over

78
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,590
the years and the threats that it faces

79
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,380
in its future let us start with a bit of

80
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,020
history shall we

81
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,180
[Applause]

82
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,900
the threat of the Red Army

83
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,599
the 1940s are about to ends the Second

84
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,970
World War ended just four years prior

85
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,190
[Music]

86
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,260
the greatest conflict of all time has

87
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,110
left tens of millions of victims of war

88
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,270
not only direct war deaths but countless

89
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,160
additional lives cut short due to

90
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,320
disease and the political brutality of

91
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,660
totalitarian ideologies the end of the

92
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,440
Second World War

93
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,940
and then the end of Nazism but at the

94
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,860
same time it also led to the emergence

95
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,270
of a new split that would not only

96
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,160
divide Europe but it would divide the

97
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,720
world and it would do it for decades yep

98
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,630
that's right the Cold War had begun at

99
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,400
that time the European continent it was

100
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,650
devastated it was economically shattered

101
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,240
and its armies were tattered and

102
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,030
demobilized however there was an

103
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,500
important difference between eastern and

104
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,720
western Europe on the one hand Eastern

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,310
Europe was under the Soviet Union's

106
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,230
control which maintained more than 5

107
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,030
million soldiers in the region camilli

108
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,830
years on the other hands the presence of

109
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,750
the US and UK troops on the continent

110
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,020
shrunk very quickly between 1945 and

111
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,550
1946 the contingents from these two

112
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,500
countries deployed in continental Europe

113
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,630
dropped from a 4.5 million soldiers in

114
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,880
less than 900,000 that is to say by the

115
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,560
end of the 40s the difference in favor

116
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,140
of the Soviet troops was 5 to 1 which

117
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,660
you know it's a pretty big difference

118
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,010
and not only that but at the time coin

119
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,350
ISM was an expanding political force it

120
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,180
was spreading to countries all around

121
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,880
the globe and of course Moscow was very

122
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,070
very certain that it was not going to

123
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,050
lose its grip on Europe on an example

124
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,100
well check this out

[Music]

126
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,500
in 1947 the Czech Republic accepted the

127
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,479
Marshall Plan but soon after it was

128
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,370
forced to renounce due to pressure from

129
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,009
Moscow only a year later in 1948 there

130
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,270
was a coup that placed the country

131
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,219
firmly under communist control in that

132
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:36,930
same year the Soviet Union carried out

133
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,830
the Berlin Blockade

134
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,810
meaning West Berlin had to be supplied

135
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,719
by a staggering airlift of 900 daily

136
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:48,210
flights for months on end anyway folks

137
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,889
these were the circumstances that

138
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,349
created real fear in Western Europe that

139
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:54,419
the Soviet troops they would advance and

140
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,430
occupy new countries such as the Federal

141
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,439
Republic of Germany or even the entire

142
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,800
continent it was for precisely this

143
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
reason that France the UK Belgium the

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,430
Netherlands and Luxembourg swiftly

145
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,529
agreed on a mutual defense clause in the

146
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:10,610
Brussels treaty this was done in 1948

147
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,990
the fearing that this wasn't enough

148
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,490
these countries quickly turned to the

149
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,439
United States the defense of Europe's

150
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,240
free countries it really had to be

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,680
ensured and that's how finally on April

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,960
the 4th 1949 12 countries France

153

of the Austrian economic center it was

165
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,139
precisely in this founding treaty that

166
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,169
the famous article 5 was established the

167
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,789
parties agreed that an armed attack

168
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,460
against one or more of them in Europe or

169
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,259
North America shall be considered an

170
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,689
attack against them all in other words a

171
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,310
very clear agreements all for one and

172
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,699
one for all we hope to create a shield

173
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:10,439
against aggression and the fear of

174
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,539
aggression a bulwark which will permit

175
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,550
us to get on with the real business of

176
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,740

182
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,009
but it didn't stop there in 1952 Turkey

183
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,719
and Greece joined the alliance and three

184
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,059
years later in 1955 the German Federal

185
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,680
Republic joined as well and it was soon

186
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,509
after that that the Soviet Union the

187
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,979
Eastern Bloc countries except the

188
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,110
Yugoslavia created their own alliance

189
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,999
the Warsaw Pact this was an alliance

190
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,919
that unified the power of all of

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,610
Europe's socialist countries we're

192
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,169
talking about more than six million

193
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,229
soldiers 65,000 tanks 15,000 combat

194
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,389
aircraft 2,000 warships and nuclear

195
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,099
missiles that were distributed among the

196
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,789
Member States Europe it was divided to

197
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,249
great military alliances confronted each

198
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:07,189
other across a lion sketched on a map

199
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,779
okay so at this point you might be

200
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,300
wondering well what does NATO really

201
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,860
done how many missions how many

202
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,749
interventions have they led how has the

203
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,460
alliance changed well let's get into

204
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,320
that

205
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,479
[Music]

206
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,870
a decisive year

207
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,060
[Music]

208
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,860
after the fall of the Berlin Wall and

209
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,050
the collapse of the Soviet Union NATO an

210
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,180
organization created to face the Soviet

211
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,280
threat did not decrease its activity on

212
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,990
the contrary it slowly began to have a

213
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,300
much more active role both inside and

214
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,420
outside Europe throughout this process

215
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,920
1999 was a key year

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,840
[Music]

217
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,630
in that year three new countries join

218
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,370
the Alliance Poland Hungary and the

219
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,500
Czech Republic remember that these three

220
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,790
countries had once belonged to the

221
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,800
Warsaw Pact and has therefore been seen

222
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,710
by native decades as enemy countries

223
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,620
they do not become from the world of

224
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,860
diplomacy in my previous incarnation it

225
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,770
was the professor of theoretical physics

226
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,730
and I know very well that motion is a

227
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,360
relative concept you move in relation to

228
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,540
something in that which is true for

229
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,779
Natural Sciences it's also true for

230
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,529
history in an organization has to move

231
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,350
according to the time it has to move

232
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,400
faster to the backdrop and let's suppose

233
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,490
that backdrop is history when history

234
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,070
moves very fast as it's taking place in

235
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,950
these years nobody says that we want to

236
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,470
be relevant they have to move faster

237
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,190
than history faster this backdrop if

238
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,510
they want to be relevant for the future

239
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,320
I like to say that all of you have made

240
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,140
this organization to adapt its rhythm

241
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,510
that probably none of the organization

242
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,040
that were born after the secondary world

243
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,470
ham stands

244
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,810
it was the beginning of a process that

245
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,460
over the years led NATO to include a

246
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,690
large number of Eastern Bloc countries

247
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,640
that had been under Soviet control

248
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,800
Latvia Lithuania Estonia Bulgaria

249
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,710
Romania even Albania this huge expansion

250
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,140
of NATO infuriated the Russian political

251
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,090
elites but gave the organization much

252
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,100
more strength while also aiding these

253
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,660
newly independent countries to

254
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,210
accelerate and consolidate their reforms

255
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,160
without fear of reprisals from Russia

256
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,740
but that folks it's still Nepal 1999 was

257
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,990
also the year when NATO carried out its

258
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,330
first major offensive it intervened in

259
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,160
former Yugoslavia to stop the ethnic

260
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,630
cleansing that the Serbian leader

261
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,580
Slobodan Milosevic's was carrying out

262
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,100
against the Kosovo Albania nation to

263
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,780
stop the Serbian government NATO carry

264
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,700
out heavy attacks against political and

265
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,860
military targets and everybody has to

266
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,350
look forward and to try not only to

267
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,800
reconstruct physically the country that

268
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,150
more on to the consulate

269
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,179
[Music]

270
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,279
folks NATO spirit had changed there was

271
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,870
no longer just a defensive organization

272
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:28,090
[Music]

273
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,740
as any given moment that was even

274
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,660
speculation of a possible terrestrial

275
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,060
invasion of Serbia with NATO troops and

276
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,860
you know what it's rumored that the then

277
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,420
Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was so

278
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,400
humiliated and enraged because NATO had

279
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,810
dared to include Eastern European

280
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,820
countries in his alliance but he even

281
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,620
threatened a third world war

282
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,450
if NATO's troops tried to occupy Serbia

283
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,480
Russia would respond I have warned NATO

284
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,820
the Americans and the Germans not to

285
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,740
push us into military action otherwise

286
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,900
there will certainly be a European war

287
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,480
and maybe a world war Boris Yeltsin

288
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,960
President of Russia in a way years later

289
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,910
in 2008 Moscow his threats became a

290
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,480
reality

291
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,950
George's approach by Mikhail Saakashvili

292
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,260
to the European Union and above all to

293
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,790
NATO led the Russian government's you

294
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,950
unleash a war against this country the

295
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,480
point folks is that in the last few

296
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,520
years we've seen NATO take a much more

297
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,900
active role in addition to their

298
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,580
continued expansion and the intervention

299
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,440
in Serbia NATO is also intervened in

300
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,620
Afghanistan Iraq and Libya

301
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,270
and this has led to a huge controversy

302
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,830
the current debate it goes something

303
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,340
like this

304
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,350
should NATO become an institution that

305
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,330
acts where needed to protect its member

306
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,250
states even if they aren't under direct

307
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,410
attack should it step in if human rights

308
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,300
are being seriously violated anywhere in

309
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,800
the world or should have been limited to

310
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,750
being exclusively a defensive alliance

311
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,480
that is limit itself to act only if a

312
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,860
member country is militarily attacked

313
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,899
in short does NATO make sense today as

314
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,450
it was originally intended

315
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,959
[Applause]

316
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,610
and be careful because the implications

317
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,170
of this debate are huge

318
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,819
after all we're talking about the future

319
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:15,680
of the world and the role of the most

320
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,499
important military alliance of all time

321
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,029
we're talking about a debate that is at

322
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,709
the forefront and that in recent times

323
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,209
has had the president of the United

324
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,160
States Donald Trump as its undisputed

325
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,559
protagonist he claims that NATO no

326
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,059
longer works that it doesn't make sense

327
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,569
that it obsolete

328
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:37,339
absolutely and number two the people

329
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:39,259
aren't paying their way it's obsolete

330
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,410
and we pay too much fun NATO we're gonna

331
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,730
have the people that aren't paying

332
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,920
they're gonna start paying it's absolute

333
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,839
they were getting ripped in NATO they

334
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,309
don't pay their bills they are

335
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,329
delinquent and this gives rise to

336
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:55,759
another question so far NATO has always

337
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,259
worked under the leadership of the

338
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,029
United States but could it still work

339
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:00,860
and have a future if the United States

340
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,779
steps down from its leadership position

341
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,970
even if the u.s. remained a member could

342
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,220
NATO be compatible with a new military

343
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,500
leadership structure

344
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
[Music]

345
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,460
this is a topic that we've already

346
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,200
talked about here on visual politic on

347
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
several occasions but we'll take a more

348
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,970
detailed look in a future video

349
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,550
[Music]

350
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,770
for now we can say that despite their

351
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,810
problems and their mistakes NATO has

352
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:28,670
certainly been a huge success

353
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,320
I mean Europe today enjoys an

354
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,880
environment of peace safety and

355
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,560
cooperation between countries I mean

356
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,540
it's kind of like a good gang of friends

357
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,640
and don't think that this was always the

358
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,890
case nothing could be further from the

359
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,340
truth

360
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,020
for centuries conflicts and Wars between

361
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,120
European nations were routine events and

362
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,440
even after the Second World War the

363
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,880
tension between the west and the East

364
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,860
had only flourished in many senses NATO

365
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,900
fulfilled its purpose perfectly even

366
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,220
though its member countries haven't

367
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,050
always gotten along and have had their

368
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,880
good and bad times like when France

369
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,320
withdrew from the joint military

370
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,110
structure not the Alliance in 1966

371
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,340
anyway folks that is the story of how

372
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,710
NATO was born grew and changed in a

373
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,210
future video we're going to examine what

374
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,980
