1
00:00:00.0 --> 00:00:03.179
new zealand's is a remarkable country

2
00:00:01.74 --> 00:00:05.250
with little more than four and a half

3
00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.859
million inhabitants in a service area of

4
00:00:05.25 --> 00:00:12.290
268 thousand square kilometers it is a

5
00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.290
little bit smaller than Japan or Italy

6
00:00:14.48 --> 00:00:19.470
it is located in the South Pacific and

7
00:00:17.34 --> 00:00:22.590
we could say it New Zealand is far from

8
00:00:19.47 --> 00:00:24.480
well literally everything because even

9
00:00:22.59 --> 00:00:26.430
though it feels like it's right near

10
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:28.670
Australia by looking at the map these

11
00:00:26.43 --> 00:00:32.070
two countries are separated by more than

12
00:00:28.67 --> 00:00:33.930
1,600 kilometers at their closest this

13
00:00:32.07 --> 00:00:36.239
is why we can find their endemic species

14
00:00:33.93 --> 00:00:41.280
such as the Kiwi and non-flying

15
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.050
nocturnal bird despite being such an

16
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:44.670
isolated country New Zealand has managed

17
00:00:43.05 --> 00:00:47.010
to become not following a rather unique

18
00:00:44.67 --> 00:00:49.500
model one of the countries in the world

19
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:51.210
that enjoys one of the highest standards

20
00:00:49.5 --> 00:00:52.559
of living in this first video we're

21
00:00:51.21 --> 00:00:55.630
going to tell you about some of the most

22
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.840
striking keys to New Zealand success

23
00:00:55.63 --> 00:00:58.840
[Applause]

24
00:01:01.17 --> 00:01:05.530
[Music]

25
00:01:03.0 --> 00:01:07.000
there is an austere peated comments or

26
00:01:05.53 --> 00:01:09.430
feeling if you wish which takes place

27
00:01:07.0 --> 00:01:11.200
over and over again every time someone

28
00:01:09.43 --> 00:01:13.360
is asked about new zealand's after eight

29
00:01:11.2 --> 00:01:15.430
visits they all say it as a country of

30
00:01:13.36 --> 00:01:17.710
congeniality and quality of life a

31
00:01:15.43 --> 00:01:19.930
country that everyone seems to want to

32
00:01:17.71 --> 00:01:21.850
go back to I'm happy to say

33
00:01:19.93 --> 00:01:24.070
categorically that I have found no other

34
00:01:21.85 --> 00:01:26.710
country that aligned more with my view

35
00:01:24.07 --> 00:01:29.380
of the future than New Zealand Peter

36
00:01:26.71 --> 00:01:31.240
teal so if something is for sure it is

37
00:01:29.38 --> 00:01:33.700
that New Zealand is above all a

38
00:01:31.24 --> 00:01:35.350
welcoming integrating country so how

39
00:01:33.7 --> 00:01:38.110
about we look at a piece of evidence for

40
00:01:35.35 --> 00:01:39.970
that well do consider this one out of

41
00:01:38.11 --> 00:01:42.190
four of New Zealand's inhabitants has

42
00:01:39.97 --> 00:01:44.800
been abroad and here sign language is

43
00:01:42.19 --> 00:01:46.510
considered an official language less it

44
00:01:44.8 --> 00:01:48.850
isn't certain we have plenty of reasons

45
00:01:46.51 --> 00:01:50.740
to be happy and more than satisfied

46
00:01:48.85 --> 00:01:52.600
further New Zealand is one of the top

47
00:01:50.74 --> 00:01:54.400
five safest countries in the world its

48
00:01:52.6 --> 00:01:55.240
economy is the third freest on the

49
00:01:54.4 --> 00:01:56.890
entire planet

50
00:01:55.24 --> 00:01:59.050
and according to the doing business

51
00:01:56.89 --> 00:02:00.820
ranking it is the number one country in

52
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:01.869
the world when it comes to the ease of

53
00:02:00.82 --> 00:02:04.990
doing business

54
00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.030
yep you heard that right New Zealand

55
00:02:04.99 --> 00:02:09.520
dethrone Singapore as easiest place to

56
00:02:07.03 --> 00:02:11.650
do business but this it's not the end of

57
00:02:09.52 --> 00:02:13.750
our story today not even close

58
00:02:11.65 --> 00:02:15.550
New Zealand is also considered the least

59
00:02:13.75 --> 00:02:17.710
corrupt country in the world along with

60
00:02:15.55 --> 00:02:19.900
Denmark employment rates here are higher

61
00:02:17.71 --> 00:02:22.060
than the average in the OECD and it has

62
00:02:19.9 --> 00:02:24.340
excellent educational sanitary and

63
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:26.710
cultural systems in other words New

64
00:02:24.34 --> 00:02:29.140
Zealand is both an economic and social

65
00:02:26.71 --> 00:02:30.910
success story but leaving all of that

66
00:02:29.14 --> 00:02:33.819
aside in this video we're going to focus

67
00:02:30.91 --> 00:02:38.340
on one of the most distinctive keys to

68
00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.270
its success and that's the countryside

69
00:02:38.34 --> 00:02:44.010
New Zealand a land of farmers

70
00:02:42.27 --> 00:02:45.840
New Zealand is the only developed

71
00:02:44.01 --> 00:02:47.790
country where the primary sector has

72
00:02:45.84 --> 00:02:49.620
become more relevant in the last three

73
00:02:47.79 --> 00:02:52.050
decades this sector represents today

74
00:02:49.62 --> 00:02:57.540
almost seven percent of the country's

75
00:02:52.05 --> 00:02:59.040
economy to highlight just quite how much

76
00:02:57.54 --> 00:03:01.890
this is consider the fact that the

77
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:04.170
primary sector is just 1.6 percent of

78
00:03:01.89 --> 00:03:06.750
the economy of the European Union four

79
00:03:04.17 --> 00:03:08.640
times less than New Zealand even Spain

80
00:03:06.75 --> 00:03:10.530
whose primary sector represents a little

81
00:03:08.64 --> 00:03:12.270
more than 2% of its economy and is

82
00:03:10.53 --> 00:03:14.280
considered the orchard of Europe looks

83
00:03:12.27 --> 00:03:16.020
pretty ridiculous when compared to the

84
00:03:14.28 --> 00:03:18.480
countries that we're discussing today

85
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:19.830
there is simply no equivalent in the

86
00:03:18.48 --> 00:03:21.930
entire world

87
00:03:19.83 --> 00:03:24.180
for example milk and dairy here are the

88
00:03:21.93 --> 00:03:26.370
largest exports from New Zealand in fact

89
00:03:24.18 --> 00:03:28.170
if we add both the primary sectors of

90
00:03:26.37 --> 00:03:31.290
the agri-food industry these two

91
00:03:28.17 --> 00:03:32.410
represent 60% of the nation's trade

92
00:03:31.29 --> 00:03:38.390
exports

93
00:03:32.41 --> 00:03:40.770

[Music]

98
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:49.019
did you have really thought this could

99
00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.299
be possible that the countryside could

100
00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.129
be the main economic engine in the

101
00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.080
country with one of the best welfare

102
00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.540
systems and standards of living on the

103
00:03:55.08 --> 00:03:59.760
entire planet it is quite simply rather

104
00:03:57.54 --> 00:04:01.530
amazing the agricultural competition

105
00:03:59.76 --> 00:04:03.329
here is so high that they even managed

106
00:04:01.53 --> 00:04:05.849
to achieve this without having to rely

107
00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.239
on governmental subsidies consider the

108
00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.069
difference yeah every year the European

109
00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.230
Union grants agriculture and livestock

110
00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.340
subsidies worth around twenty one

111
00:04:13.23 --> 00:04:19.470
percent total production in Spain alone

112
00:04:17.34 --> 00:04:22.289
the European Union has foreseen that

113
00:04:19.47 --> 00:04:24.360
they will have to give 55 billion US

114
00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:29.370
dollars in farming support between the

115
00:04:24.36 --> 00:04:30.510
years 2014 and 2020 and I'd be thinking

116
00:04:29.37 --> 00:04:32.669
that the American system is any

117
00:04:30.51 --> 00:04:34.380
different all right so in North America

118
00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.930
subsidies are a bit lower than they are

119
00:04:34.38 --> 00:04:40.020
in the EU but they are still around 8%

120
00:04:36.93 --> 00:04:42.270
of all agricultural production and well

121
00:04:40.02 --> 00:04:44.010
that's a loss now new zealand downs

122
00:04:42.27 --> 00:04:47.490
handsome government subsidies but they

123
00:04:44.01 --> 00:04:49.530
are just 0.9% of production which is 23

124
00:04:47.49 --> 00:04:51.750
times less than the european union and

125
00:04:49.53 --> 00:04:54.510
almost 10 times less than the united

126
00:04:51.75 --> 00:04:56.610
states not bad right besides if this

127
00:04:54.51 --> 00:04:58.560
wasn't enough using them spending is

128
00:04:56.61 --> 00:05:01.010
mostly bound for investments and

129
00:04:58.56 --> 00:05:05.520
innovation

130
00:05:01.01 --> 00:05:08.710
[Applause]

131
00:05:05.52 --> 00:05:11.640
as you can see they save a great deal

132
00:05:08.71 --> 00:05:13.800
this 12 it hasn't always been the case

133
00:05:11.64 --> 00:05:16.390
[Music]

134
00:05:13.8 --> 00:05:19.050
Audra Nam --ax and the New Zealand their

135
00:05:16.39 --> 00:05:19.050
farming revolution

136
00:05:19.78 --> 00:05:25.120
in the early 1980s almost 40% of farming

137
00:05:22.9 --> 00:05:26.830
income came from government subsidies at

138
00:05:25.12 --> 00:05:29.020
the time the national economy was the

139
00:05:26.83 --> 00:05:31.360
archetype of protectionism and the

140
00:05:29.02 --> 00:05:32.740
system whelming didn't exactly work the

141
00:05:31.36 --> 00:05:38.170
economy over the country was going

142
00:05:32.74 --> 00:05:40.420
through a tough crisis the public

143
00:05:38.17 --> 00:05:42.310
deficit was enormous almost 10% of the

144
00:05:40.42 --> 00:05:43.870
national GDP there was double digit

145
00:05:42.31 --> 00:05:45.970
inflation the external debt and

146
00:05:43.87 --> 00:05:50.320
unemployment kept rising and the economy

147
00:05:45.97 --> 00:05:52.210
was in a state of stagnation now in 1984

148
00:05:50.32 --> 00:05:53.860
the economics minister of the recently

149
00:05:52.21 --> 00:05:55.840
elected Labour government rancher

150
00:05:53.86 --> 00:05:57.970
Douglas started an ambitious reform

151
00:05:55.84 --> 00:05:59.680
program known as Raja na mcc's

152
00:05:57.97 --> 00:06:01.300
in this program in many areas of the

153
00:05:59.68 --> 00:06:03.220
economy were liberalized and this

154
00:06:01.3 --> 00:06:05.290
included the primary sector and these

155
00:06:03.22 --> 00:06:07.570
changes they took place almost overnight

156
00:06:05.29 --> 00:06:11.100
price controls were eliminated and most

157
00:06:07.57 --> 00:06:13.330
farming subsidies were removed

158
00:06:11.1 --> 00:06:15.250
furthermore in order to fight inflation

159
00:06:13.33 --> 00:06:17.470
the government decided to raise interest

160
00:06:15.25 --> 00:06:19.090
rates this was really unpopular and

161
00:06:17.47 --> 00:06:21.130
farmers were angry since they had gone

162
00:06:19.09 --> 00:06:23.320
into debt in previous years it was the

163
00:06:21.13 --> 00:06:25.390
perfect storm in some holes debt

164
00:06:23.32 --> 00:06:27.970
interest spending increases and there

165
00:06:25.39 --> 00:06:30.460
was a fall in the price of lands as you

166
00:06:27.97 --> 00:06:32.560
can imagine this change wasn't easy and

167
00:06:30.46 --> 00:06:35.200
it all seemed to indicate a future

168
00:06:32.56 --> 00:06:36.910
disaster however the country soon felt

169
00:06:35.2 --> 00:06:39.400
the benefits of putting an end to

170
00:06:36.91 --> 00:06:41.410
subsidization the income fool encouraged

171
00:06:39.4 --> 00:06:43.300
farmers to looks at innovations capable

172
00:06:41.41 --> 00:06:45.160
of raising the levels of production they

173
00:06:43.3 --> 00:06:47.200
introduced new crops improve the quality

174
00:06:45.16 --> 00:06:49.600
of their current crops and used more

175
00:06:47.2 --> 00:06:51.520
ecological farming methods they simply

176
00:06:49.6 --> 00:06:53.350
have to find a way to stand out from the

177
00:06:51.52 --> 00:06:55.870
crowd on the other hand they began to be

178
00:06:53.35 --> 00:06:57.340
very careful about cost and this it

179
00:06:55.87 --> 00:06:59.169
wasn't just about maximizing the

180
00:06:57.34 --> 00:07:01.690
production of subsidized products they

181
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.060
had to improve the value chain adapt to

182
00:07:01.69 --> 00:07:05.770
consumers and reduce costs let's

183
00:07:04.06 --> 00:07:07.930
consider an example subsidizing

184
00:07:05.77 --> 00:07:09.460
fertilisers had resulted in the careless

185
00:07:07.93 --> 00:07:11.530
use of them when there were no more

186
00:07:09.46 --> 00:07:13.750
subsidies for these fertilisers the use

187
00:07:11.53 --> 00:07:15.760
of fertilisers fell without affecting

188
00:07:13.75 --> 00:07:17.680
production farmers learned to only use

189
00:07:15.76 --> 00:07:19.330
them whenever necessary which helped

190
00:07:17.68 --> 00:07:21.520
with the cost of production that also

191
00:07:19.33 --> 00:07:23.169
helps the environment the same happens

192
00:07:21.52 --> 00:07:24.810
with other things and this created a

193
00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:27.190
more efficient and sustainable

194
00:07:24.81 --> 00:07:28.780
agricultural system when we consider the

195
00:07:27.19 --> 00:07:31.000
new crops and products that new zealand

196
00:07:28.78 --> 00:07:32.890
started producing there is probably no

197
00:07:31.0 --> 00:07:33.590
better example than that of the wine

198
00:07:32.89 --> 00:07:35.240
industry

199
00:07:33.59 --> 00:07:37.100
the safes dedicated to Vineyards has

200
00:07:35.24 --> 00:07:39.410
almost tripled in the last decade and

201
00:07:37.1 --> 00:07:40.040
New Zealand wine has become known around

202
00:07:39.41 --> 00:07:41.840
the world

203
00:07:40.04 --> 00:07:44.030
moreover with the goal of finding new

204
00:07:41.84 --> 00:07:46.190
revenue sources the rural population

205
00:07:44.03 --> 00:07:48.110
started to develop additional businesses

206
00:07:46.19 --> 00:07:50.630
like rural tourism or elaborate

207
00:07:48.11 --> 00:07:52.820
agri-food products like closely relying

208
00:07:50.63 --> 00:07:55.140
on environmental preservation and highly

209
00:07:52.82 --> 00:08:01.940
valued brands

210
00:07:55.14 --> 00:08:03.890
[Music]

211
00:08:01.94 --> 00:08:05.120
this meant that farmers started to

212
00:08:03.89 --> 00:08:05.840
commit to the protection of the

213
00:08:05.12 --> 00:08:07.310
environment

214
00:08:05.84 --> 00:08:10.280
now farmers realized that preservation

215
00:08:07.31 --> 00:08:12.560
of the ecosystem was also profitable in

216
00:08:10.28 --> 00:08:15.770
economic terms the result of this well

217
00:08:12.56 --> 00:08:19.310
it was an incredible revolution in the

218
00:08:15.77 --> 00:08:21.290
end only 800 interests 1% of all of them

219
00:08:19.31 --> 00:08:23.810
had to close down and in the next 20

220
00:08:21.29 --> 00:08:28.640
years after 1986 the production in this

221
00:08:23.81 --> 00:08:30.320
sector grew by 40% and pay close

222
00:08:28.64 --> 00:08:32.419
attention to that figure since the

223
00:08:30.32 --> 00:08:34.580
removal of subsidies the primary sector

224
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:38.120
has grown more than the rest of the

225
00:08:34.58 --> 00:08:40.010
economy between 1986 and 2006 the

226
00:08:38.12 --> 00:08:43.530
primary sector had sustained growth of

227
00:08:40.01 --> 00:08:46.710
5.9 percent per year

228
00:08:43.53 --> 00:08:46.710
[Music]

229
00:08:50.03 --> 00:08:54.920
so New Zealand really has thrived after

230
00:08:52.85 --> 00:08:57.500
the removal of subsidies along with this

231
00:08:54.92 --> 00:08:58.910
progress internalization was also key it

232
00:08:57.5 --> 00:09:00.950
led the New Zealand countryside

233
00:08:58.91 --> 00:09:02.600
competitively exports more than 90

234
00:09:00.95 --> 00:09:03.980
percent of its production and in

235
00:09:02.6 --> 00:09:06.380
addition to all of that it's all

236
00:09:03.98 --> 00:09:08.120
incredibly environmentally friendly so I

237
00:09:06.38 --> 00:09:10.160
think what else could we possibly ask

238
00:09:08.12 --> 00:09:12.620
for New Zealand dear viewer it's the

239
00:09:10.16 --> 00:09:14.900
perfect example of how bad policies and

240
00:09:12.62 --> 00:09:17.390
subsidization can damage innovation

241
00:09:14.9 --> 00:09:19.610
diversification and productivity while

242
00:09:17.39 --> 00:09:21.980
at the same time creating a burden for

243
00:09:19.61 --> 00:09:23.930
the public economy this is exactly what

244
00:09:21.98 --> 00:09:25.940
is happening with the capt european

245
00:09:23.93 --> 00:09:28.570
protectionist agricultural policy which

246
00:09:25.94 --> 00:09:30.890
costs around fifty billion euros every

247
00:09:28.57 --> 00:09:32.840
single year on the contrary

248
00:09:30.89 --> 00:09:34.820
new zealand shows that by doing things

249
00:09:32.84 --> 00:09:36.740
right it is not only possible to save a

250
00:09:34.82 --> 00:09:38.780
lot of money but at the same time it's

251
00:09:36.74 --> 00:09:41.480
possible for rural areas to improve

252
00:09:38.78 --> 00:09:43.970
substantially new zealand has absolutely

253
00:09:41.48 --> 00:09:46.340
proven that farming can prosper without

254
00:09:43.97 --> 00:09:48.290
public aid and while new zealand is

255
00:09:46.34 --> 00:09:50.420
trying to double their farming exports

256
00:09:48.29 --> 00:09:52.010
by 2025 the rest of the countries are

257
00:09:50.42 --> 00:09:54.290
still involved in the debate around

258
00:09:52.01 --> 00:09:56.089
subsidization but that's our opinion

259
00:09:54.29 --> 00:09:57.650
here at fish apology and we'd now love

260
00:09:56.089 --> 00:09:59.839
to know what you think do you think the

261
00:09:57.65 --> 00:10:01.610
countryside will die without public aid

262
00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:03.680
could New Zealand's success could be

263
00:10:01.61 --> 00:10:05.420
replicated somewhere else well we'd love

264
00:10:03.68 --> 00:10:06.860
to know what you think please let us
