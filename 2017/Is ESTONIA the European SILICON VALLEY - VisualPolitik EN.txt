3
00:00:07.16 --> 00:00:11.190
it's only unlikely a country that you've

4
00:00:09.51 --> 00:00:14.009
only heard about on the Eurovision Song

5
00:00:11.19 --> 00:00:16.260
Contest if you watch the Eurovision Song

6
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.140
Contest but the reality is that Estonia

7
00:00:16.26 --> 00:00:21.240
is a pioneering country in many field

8
00:00:19.14 --> 00:00:23.519
some might even call it the Silicon

9
00:00:21.24 --> 00:00:26.220
Valley of Europe companies like Skype

10
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.869
and transferwise were created in Estonia

11
00:00:26.22 --> 00:00:30.240
this is particularly surprising given

12
00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
that just thirty years ago Estonia was a

13
00:00:30.24 --> 00:00:35.190
part of the Soviet Union in fact

14
00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.739
geographically Estonia situation is far

15
00:00:35.19 --> 00:00:39.809
from being ideal their weather is pretty

16
00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.180
terrible and in the winter they have as

17
00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.079
little as three hours of daylight every

18
00:00:42.18 --> 00:00:48.059
day plus they also have an ongoing

19
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.160
demographic crisis that they are really

20
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.110
struggling to solve further unlike most

21
00:00:50.16 --> 00:00:54.239
countries the female population of

22
00:00:52.11 --> 00:00:56.430
Estonia is markedly higher than the male

23
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
population this means that people find

24
00:00:56.43 --> 00:01:00.960
it harder to find the partner and have

25
00:00:58.41 --> 00:01:03.270
children this is why every year Estonia

26
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:05.339
maintains a course of population

27
00:01:03.27 --> 00:01:07.350
reduction and yet despite all of this

28
00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.170
Estonia is the most technologically

29
00:01:07.35 --> 00:01:11.850
advanced nation in all of Europe in fact

30
00:01:10.17 --> 00:01:14.040
it is the only country in Europe where

31
00:01:11.85 --> 00:01:16.020
access to the Internet is recognized in

32
00:01:14.04 --> 00:01:17.670
the Constitution but what really makes

33
00:01:16.02 --> 00:01:20.140
Estonia getting through our country's

34
00:01:17.67 --> 00:01:22.420
Hall of Fame is its king of residency

35
00:01:20.14 --> 00:01:25.280
[Music]

36
00:01:22.42 --> 00:01:26.990
this means vert a person no matter where

37
00:01:25.28 --> 00:01:29.899
they are from can simply fill out a form

38
00:01:26.99 --> 00:01:31.220
and become a virtual citizen of Estonia

39
00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.869
but the question you might have in your

40
00:01:31.22 --> 00:01:34.130
mind right now is but what does that

41
00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.810
really mean

42
00:01:34.13 --> 00:01:38.090
today we are going to explain this to

43
00:01:35.81 --> 00:01:41.200
you in this video but first let's have a

44
00:01:38.09 --> 00:01:44.750
quick look at the history of Estonia the

45
00:01:41.2 --> 00:01:47.420
first victims of Vladimir poutine in

46
00:01:44.75 --> 00:01:49.490
1991 Estonia got its independence from

47
00:01:47.42 --> 00:01:51.530
the Soviet Union yes other countries

48
00:01:49.49 --> 00:01:54.880
like Belarus and Ukraine got their

49
00:01:51.53 --> 00:01:57.319
independence at around the same time but

50
00:01:54.88 --> 00:01:59.479
in those countries the new political

51
00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.970
establishments have a lot of influence

52
00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.729
from the old communists early Estonia

53
00:02:01.97 --> 00:02:07.220
won different their first Democratic

54
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.009
prime minister mark la formed a cabinet

55
00:02:07.22 --> 00:02:12.080
with an average age of just 30 years old

56
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.660
these were young people with new ideas

57
00:02:12.08 --> 00:02:16.730
who had no debt to the old Soviet Guard

58
00:02:14.66 --> 00:02:18.380
and this is how it's turning out opened

59
00:02:16.73 --> 00:02:20.510
their markets to the International

60
00:02:18.38 --> 00:02:22.549
economy they assaulted a capitalist

61
00:02:20.51 --> 00:02:24.950
system and a fairly unique political

62
00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.320
system that would become well known for

63
00:02:24.95 --> 00:02:29.630
its minimalism in fact it is this word

64
00:02:27.32 --> 00:02:32.090
minimalism that really describes Estonia

65
00:02:29.63 --> 00:02:33.410
better than any other even their flag is

66
00:02:32.09 --> 00:02:35.269
minimalist and is simply a

67
00:02:33.41 --> 00:02:35.940
representation of their traditional

68
00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.049
landscape

69
00:02:35.94 --> 00:02:40.670
[Music]

70
00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.920
even their taxation is minimalist and

71
00:02:40.67 --> 00:02:45.049
they have a flat rate tax system this

72
00:02:42.92 --> 00:02:47.329
means that everyone in the country pays

73
00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.879
the same percentage of tax no matter how

74
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.459
much they earn in this case in Estonia

75
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.079
the income tax is just 20 percent with

76
00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.969
these policies it's easy to see why is

77
00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.500
there near attractive foreign investment

78
00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.139
particularly from the Scandinavian

79
00:02:57.5 --> 00:03:02.389
countries nonetheless this was still not

80
00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.040
enough for them to grow at the rate that

81
00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.840
they wanted at the beginning of the

82
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:08.629
1990s less than half of the population

83
00:03:05.84 --> 00:03:10.040
had a phone in their home further the

84
00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.659
infrastructure which was built during

85
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:13.280
the Soviet era with spar for an

86
00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.109
acceptable answer you can imagine this

87
00:03:13.28 --> 00:03:16.970
is not a great setup for a country that

88
00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.639
is looking for economic development

89
00:03:16.97 --> 00:03:21.439
since the country had no money to invest

90
00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.760
in physical roads they instead decided

91
00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.750
to invest in virtual roads the country's

92
00:03:24.76 --> 00:03:29.480
telecommunications infrastructure and

93
00:03:26.75 --> 00:03:31.790
just 15 years later Estonia was the

94
00:03:29.48 --> 00:03:34.340
first country in the world to have an

95
00:03:31.79 --> 00:03:35.540
electronic voting system but hold on for

96
00:03:34.34 --> 00:03:38.030
just a second because all of these

97
00:03:35.54 --> 00:03:40.010
reforms didn't exactly come for free

98
00:03:38.03 --> 00:03:42.169
during these 50 years of forward

99
00:03:40.01 --> 00:03:43.819
progress the Russian minority which used

100
00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.389
to rule the country became increasingly

101
00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.879
politically isolated this is why in 2007

102
00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:52.150
the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin decided

103
00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.150
to act

104
00:03:52.26 --> 00:03:57.030
and this is how the first cyberattack in

105
00:03:55.11 --> 00:03:59.099
history was organized and yes a

106
00:03:57.03 --> 00:04:00.959
cyberattack on a country that relied

107
00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.540
heavily on its digital infrastructure

108
00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.670
was a big problem during the attack

109
00:04:03.54 --> 00:04:08.280
Estonia lost its administration which

110
00:04:05.67 --> 00:04:10.049
was so dramatic that even hospitals were

111
00:04:08.28 --> 00:04:11.879
not able to function this is why since

112
00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.069
that day NATO has added cyber security

113
00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.440
headquarters in Tallinn the Estonian

114
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.660
capital but this was not the end of

115
00:04:16.44 --> 00:04:24.479
Estonia's problem the financial crisis

116
00:04:21.66 --> 00:04:27.600
two years later in 2009 the financial

117
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.520
crisis struck Estonia hard the country

118
00:04:27.6 --> 00:04:31.620
was particularly exposed because of all

119
00:04:29.52 --> 00:04:34.050
its foreign investment all of a sudden

120
00:04:31.62 --> 00:04:35.130
the country had no money Plus this was

121
00:04:34.05 --> 00:04:38.160
the time when they were supposed to

122
00:04:35.13 --> 00:04:39.810
adopt the euro as their currency so even

123
00:04:38.16 --> 00:04:41.729
if they wanted to make the switch to the

124
00:04:39.81 --> 00:04:43.889
euro they didn't have the funds to make

125
00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.330
that happen so the government had two

126
00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.220
options they could either cut their

127
00:04:45.33 --> 00:04:49.220
spending or they could raise taxes

128
00:04:52.6 --> 00:04:57.380
unlike other countries like Spain

129
00:04:54.86 --> 00:04:58.880
Estonia took the first option in a

130
00:04:57.38 --> 00:05:01.759
matter of months the government fired

131
00:04:58.88 --> 00:05:04.610
over 10,000 workers this was about a

132
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.289
third of their entire staff politicians

133
00:05:04.61 --> 00:05:08.060
lowered their salaries and froze all

134
00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.430
state investments which included many

135
00:05:08.06 --> 00:05:14.000
construction projects all of these cuts

136
00:05:10.43 --> 00:05:15.919
caused the Estonian GDP to fall by a 14

137
00:05:14.0 --> 00:05:17.870
percent in fact year to make a

138
00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.819
comparison in their worst year during

139
00:05:17.87 --> 00:05:22.280
the financial crisis the u.s. saw their

140
00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.710
GDP fall by 8 percent nonetheless after

141
00:05:22.28 --> 00:05:26.360
going through a terrible 2009 Estonia

142
00:05:24.71 --> 00:05:32.720
sorest economy it begins to improve

143
00:05:26.36 --> 00:05:34.400
almost immediately since they didn't

144
00:05:32.72 --> 00:05:36.620
raise their taxes and business policies

145
00:05:34.4 --> 00:05:38.479
remained very flexible many of those who

146
00:05:36.62 --> 00:05:40.789
lost their jobs decided to start

147
00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.159
companies so now let's have a look at

148
00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:46.070
their unemployment chart between 2008

149
00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.349
and 2009 Estonia went from a 4 percent

150
00:05:46.07 --> 00:05:50.419
unemployment rate to a 19 percent

151
00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.250
unemployment rate at the time that this

152
00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.380
was the highest unemployment rate in all

153
00:05:52.25 --> 00:05:54.800
of Europe even higher than Greece and

154
00:05:54.38 --> 00:05:57.500
Spain

155
00:05:54.8 --> 00:05:59.750
however in just two years they cut this

156
00:05:57.5 --> 00:06:01.970
figure in half and now they have an

157
00:05:59.75 --> 00:06:04.430
admirable 6 percent unemployment rate

158
00:06:01.97 --> 00:06:06.770
and the same goes to their salary today

159
00:06:04.43 --> 00:06:08.840
a person working in Tallinn is likely to

160
00:06:06.77 --> 00:06:11.750
be making more money than most people in

161
00:06:08.84 --> 00:06:13.460
southern Europe in summary Estonia is a

162
00:06:11.75 --> 00:06:14.900
model for other countries to follow and

163
00:06:13.46 --> 00:06:16.699
now we can have a look at the key

164
00:06:14.9 --> 00:06:20.349
aspects of this country which didn't

165
00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.349
make it quite so successful

166
00:06:20.87 --> 00:06:25.889
till administration it's only a

167
00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:28.169
pioneered the idea of creating a digital

168
00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.000
ID card now many other countries have

169
00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.229
been copying this models but it's not

170
00:06:30.0 --> 00:06:33.240
something that has ever been as

171
00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.830
successful as it was in Estonia the

172
00:06:33.24 --> 00:06:36.930
reason that it is so successful in

173
00:06:34.83 --> 00:06:39.539
Estonia is because this ID card is

174
00:06:36.93 --> 00:06:41.849
actually useful for instance during the

175
00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.160
elections any Estonian citizen can take

176
00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:46.710
this LED card go to any computer and

177
00:06:44.16 --> 00:06:49.050
vote electronically from wherever they

178
00:06:46.71 --> 00:06:50.910
are there is no need for any sort of

179
00:06:49.05 --> 00:06:52.979
registration and this is incredibly

180
00:06:50.91 --> 00:06:54.870
useful if you are on holiday during an

181
00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:59.610
election or if you are someone who lives

182
00:06:54.87 --> 00:07:01.770
abroad every expat knows the hassle of

183
00:06:59.61 --> 00:07:03.630
voting while abroad having to go to the

184
00:07:01.77 --> 00:07:05.699
embassy and cast the ballot it's all a

185
00:07:03.63 --> 00:07:07.080
big headache further in addition to all

186
00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.090
of this hassle there have been cases

187
00:07:07.08 --> 00:07:11.550
where votes from abroad have simply been

188
00:07:09.09 --> 00:07:13.229
lost so that in Estonia you can use this

189
00:07:11.55 --> 00:07:15.659
ID card to do any sort of government

190
00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:17.909
business and that includes paying your

191
00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.740
taxes and forget about all of those long

192
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.860
forms that are the tax authorities make

193
00:07:19.74 --> 00:07:21.860
it

194
00:07:22.95 --> 00:07:27.810
in Estonia you can do everything from

195
00:07:25.05 --> 00:07:30.180
your mobile phone in a matter of minutes

196
00:07:27.81 --> 00:07:32.040
in fact the government has access to the

197
00:07:30.18 --> 00:07:33.600
banks so they can simply find your

198
00:07:32.04 --> 00:07:36.120
income this happens in every other

199
00:07:33.6 --> 00:07:37.980
country including the US the only

200
00:07:36.12 --> 00:07:39.870
difference is that in Estonia they think

201
00:07:37.98 --> 00:07:42.120
it's stupid to ask the same question

202
00:07:39.87 --> 00:07:43.740
twice so you simply go over you're

203
00:07:42.12 --> 00:07:45.960
citizen profile concern with

204
00:07:43.74 --> 00:07:51.030
everything's correct and pay your taxes

205
00:07:45.96 --> 00:07:53.790
just like that but hold on for one

206
00:07:51.03 --> 00:07:55.230
minute because the best is yet to come

207
00:07:53.79 --> 00:07:57.660
imagine that an unscrupulous government

208
00:07:55.23 --> 00:07:59.610
employee wants to spy on your personal

209
00:07:57.66 --> 00:08:01.350
data well then when that happens you

210
00:07:59.61 --> 00:08:03.360
will get a notification on your

211
00:08:01.35 --> 00:08:05.490
government profile you can even see

212
00:08:03.36 --> 00:08:07.950
exactly who that government employee is

213
00:08:05.49 --> 00:08:09.420
who is looking at your data and then if

214
00:08:07.95 --> 00:08:12.080
you want you can ask them why they

215
00:08:09.42 --> 00:08:12.080
aren't doing it

216
00:08:12.65 --> 00:08:17.940
this means that Estonia in this regard

217
00:08:15.54 --> 00:08:19.890
has way more transparency than any other

218
00:08:17.94 --> 00:08:21.780
democracy but if you still think this is

219
00:08:19.89 --> 00:08:27.620
not enough here's the part that really

220
00:08:21.78 --> 00:08:29.700
puts Estonia over the pan if Sounion II

221
00:08:27.62 --> 00:08:30.990
we've all heard about those big

222
00:08:29.7 --> 00:08:33.210
companies that place their fiscal

223
00:08:30.99 --> 00:08:35.370
headquarters in places like Panama or

224
00:08:33.21 --> 00:08:37.200
Luxembourg however this kind of tax

225
00:08:35.37 --> 00:08:39.180
structure is almost impossible for a

226
00:08:37.2 --> 00:08:40.500
freelancer or an SME but if in

227
00:08:39.18 --> 00:08:42.030
Luxembourg and if you want to start a

228
00:08:40.5 --> 00:08:43.920
company in Luxembourg you have to go you

229
00:08:42.03 --> 00:08:45.870
have to start by going to the notary and

230
00:08:43.92 --> 00:08:48.150
to go to the notary it's a two-three

231
00:08:45.87 --> 00:08:49.410
weeks to get an appointment and then you

232
00:08:48.15 --> 00:08:50.700
have to pay a lot of money and there's

233
00:08:49.41 --> 00:08:52.350
an awful lot of bureaucracy and

234
00:08:50.7 --> 00:08:54.150
everything like that well in Estonia

235
00:08:52.35 --> 00:08:56.430
they realized that they needed you

236
00:08:54.15 --> 00:08:58.440
citizen as I said the country faces a

237
00:08:56.43 --> 00:09:01.260
demographic crisis and well their

238
00:08:58.44 --> 00:09:02.820
weather suck that is why in 2014 they

239
00:09:01.26 --> 00:09:04.830
decided to offer their cutting-edge

240
00:09:02.82 --> 00:09:06.600
infrastructure to the whole world no

241
00:09:04.83 --> 00:09:08.700
matter where you come from and so you

242
00:09:06.6 --> 00:09:11.060
might now wonder why is this quite so

243
00:09:08.7 --> 00:09:11.060
useful

244
00:09:12.22 --> 00:09:16.510
now of course this is not the same as an

245
00:09:14.26 --> 00:09:18.970
actual citizenship and you can't use the

246
00:09:16.51 --> 00:09:21.610
residency as a passport but it is a

247
00:09:18.97 --> 00:09:23.620
digital identity issued by a European

248
00:09:21.61 --> 00:09:24.540
government and this certainly helps if

249
00:09:23.62 --> 00:09:26.830
you want to make international

250
00:09:24.54 --> 00:09:28.480
transactions or open a bank account in

251
00:09:26.83 --> 00:09:30.160
Estonia this might be particularly

252
00:09:28.48 --> 00:09:32.260
useful if you are watching this video

253
00:09:30.16 --> 00:09:34.360
from places like the Ukraine Orwell

254
00:09:32.26 --> 00:09:35.920
Venezuela the virtual card also makes it

255
00:09:34.36 --> 00:09:37.810
very easy for you to establish a company

256
00:09:35.92 --> 00:09:39.610
in Estonia and you can do that without

257
00:09:37.81 --> 00:09:44.980
having to move there or do a lot of

258
00:09:39.61 --> 00:09:45.820
complicated paperwork okay well now I

259
00:09:44.98 --> 00:09:47.950
hear you saying

260
00:09:45.82 --> 00:09:51.310
estonia's got to be a fiscal haven right

261
00:09:47.95 --> 00:09:53.290
well actually no corporate tax is 20

262
00:09:51.31 --> 00:09:55.660
percent which is the same as Finland for

263
00:09:53.29 --> 00:09:59.050
example what Estonia really offers is

264
00:09:55.66 --> 00:10:00.760
two main things simplicity and rule of

265
00:09:59.05 --> 00:10:02.620
law now mainly you think that is too

266
00:10:00.76 --> 00:10:04.930
little to offer but the reality is over

267
00:10:02.62 --> 00:10:07.240
10,000 people have already signed up for

268
00:10:04.93 --> 00:10:08.620
this virtual residency one of them is

269
00:10:07.24 --> 00:10:11.940
actually the japanese prime minister

270
00:10:08.62 --> 00:10:11.940
shinzo are they

271
00:10:13.3 --> 00:10:18.940
in other words Estonia has invented a

272
00:10:15.61 --> 00:10:23.320
brand new concept the concept of liquid

273
00:10:18.94 --> 00:10:25.210
citizenship and now here is our big

274
00:10:23.32 --> 00:10:27.430
question for you do you think other

275
00:10:25.21 --> 00:10:28.930
countries will follow the Estonian model

276
00:10:27.43 --> 00:10:30.640
do you think there is a time when

277
00:10:28.93 --> 00:10:32.590
everyone will want to embrace this

278
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:34.420
Sounion citizenship you can leave your

279
00:10:32.59 --> 00:10:36.010
answer in the comment section below and

280
00:10:34.42 --> 00:10:38.110
do not forget that we put our brand new

281
00:10:36.01 --> 00:10:39.490
