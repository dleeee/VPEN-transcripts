[Music]

3
00:00:07.73 --> 00:00:12.570
humans keep developing more and more

4
00:00:10.53 --> 00:00:14.460
powerful weapons iron weapons meet the

5
00:00:12.57 --> 00:00:16.560
ones later John's and then artillery

6
00:00:14.46 --> 00:00:18.690
came along and quite literally blew

7
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:20.279
everything else out of the water and now

8
00:00:18.69 --> 00:00:22.380
today with airplanes satellites

9
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
submarines and missiles we have a game

10
00:00:22.38 --> 00:00:25.550
that completely changed the way we make

11
00:00:24.39 --> 00:00:29.670
war

12
00:00:25.55 --> 00:00:29.670
[Music]

13
00:00:30.71 --> 00:00:34.850
in fact military innovation has produced

14
00:00:32.84 --> 00:00:37.040
many important technological advances

15
00:00:34.85 --> 00:00:38.660
but it all does have a limit the

16
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:41.570
destructive effects of weapons of mass

17
00:00:38.66 --> 00:00:43.489
destruction or WMD has forced rules to

18
00:00:41.57 --> 00:00:45.829
limit their use their production and

19
00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.809
their storage and well this is

20
00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.460
completely necessary if we don't want

21
00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.780
the planet to be well completely

22
00:00:49.46 --> 00:00:59.140
destroyed the fight against nuclear

23
00:00:56.78 --> 00:00:59.140
proliferation

24
00:01:00.47 --> 00:01:06.210
wmds can be biological chemical

25
00:01:03.0 --> 00:01:08.280
radiological and nuclear but the biggest

26
00:01:06.21 --> 00:01:10.320
problem we face are these nuclear

27
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:12.630
weapons this is due to their sheer

28
00:01:10.32 --> 00:01:14.580
destructive power and because thousands

29
00:01:12.63 --> 00:01:16.830
and thousands of them were accumulated

30
00:01:14.58 --> 00:01:19.110
during their arms race in the Cold War

31
00:01:16.83 --> 00:01:21.330
we will develop a larger and more

32
00:01:19.11 --> 00:01:23.970
accurate sea-based ballistic missile

33
00:01:21.33 --> 00:01:26.460
we will also deploy nuclear cruise

34
00:01:23.97 --> 00:01:29.130
missiles in some existing submarines in

35
00:01:26.46 --> 00:01:30.840
the 1960s 70s and 80s art music and

36
00:01:29.13 --> 00:01:32.310
civil movements took action against

37
00:01:30.84 --> 00:01:34.380
nuclear weapons maybe you remember

38
00:01:32.31 --> 00:01:38.820
flower power or at least you've probably

39
00:01:34.38 --> 00:01:40.590
heard of it soon as the songs which best

40
00:01:38.82 --> 00:01:41.759
represent the story of these years and

41
00:01:40.59 --> 00:01:43.500
that you recommend that you go and

42
00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.450
listen to them if you haven't our Enola

43
00:01:43.5 --> 00:01:49.259
Gay by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the dark

44
00:01:45.45 --> 00:01:51.119
and 99 red balloons by Nina subs the

45
00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.070
real challenge today is keeping North

46
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.649
Korea or Iran from continuing their

47
00:01:53.07 --> 00:01:57.450
programs to develop WMDs and further to

48
00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.890
keep such weapons out of the hands of

49
00:01:57.45 --> 00:02:00.890
terrorist organizations

50
00:02:02.81 --> 00:02:07.220
a nuclear crisis in Korea would be a

51
00:02:05.81 --> 00:02:09.259
tragedy and it would certainly affect

52
00:02:07.22 --> 00:02:11.540
globalization trade and are very

53
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.099
lifestyles now the problem here is quite

54
00:02:11.54 --> 00:02:14.989
indexed and we should really analyze it

55
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.400
from a global perspective as we said

56
00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.780
there are international rules which

57
00:02:16.4 --> 00:02:20.000
limits the acquisition of nuclear

58
00:02:17.78 --> 00:02:22.459
weapons these rules are classified into

59
00:02:20.0 --> 00:02:23.959
two different categories horizontal

60
00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.700
non-proliferation this is meant to

61
00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.650
prevent countries which don't have these

62
00:02:25.7 --> 00:02:30.050
weapons from obtaining them and then

63
00:02:27.65 --> 00:02:31.610
there is vertical non-proliferation and

64
00:02:30.05 --> 00:02:33.560
this is meant to stop States already in

65
00:02:31.61 --> 00:02:35.569
possession of nuclear weapons especially

66
00:02:33.56 --> 00:02:37.340
the US and Russia from increasing the

67
00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.140
number of nuclear weapons they have and

68
00:02:37.34 --> 00:02:40.120
even encouraging reducing these

69
00:02:39.14 --> 00:02:44.890
stockpiles

70
00:02:40.12 --> 00:02:49.540
[Music]

71
00:02:44.89 --> 00:02:51.890
horizontal non-proliferation the NPT

72
00:02:49.54 --> 00:02:53.840
horizontal non-proliferation tries to

73
00:02:51.89 --> 00:02:55.640
prevent new countries from joining the

74
00:02:53.84 --> 00:02:57.320
nuclear Club and obviously it

75
00:02:55.64 --> 00:02:59.270
specifically aims to prevent countries

76
00:02:57.32 --> 00:03:01.430
like Iran North Korea as well as

77
00:02:59.27 --> 00:03:03.950
terrorist organizations from getting

78
00:03:01.43 --> 00:03:05.480
these weapons yes you might remember now

79
00:03:03.95 --> 00:03:06.920
that we did another video on this where

80
00:03:05.48 --> 00:03:08.780
we talked about how the rules aren't

81
00:03:06.92 --> 00:03:11.120
really working so well in the case of

82
00:03:08.78 --> 00:03:14.180
North Korea well this is what the NPT

83
00:03:11.12 --> 00:03:16.730
has achieved since 1968 in the early 60s

84
00:03:14.18 --> 00:03:19.160
it was estimated by the year 2000 around

85
00:03:16.73 --> 00:03:21.110
20 countries would hold nuclear weapons

86
00:03:19.16 --> 00:03:23.810
many countries like Algeria Argentina

87
00:03:21.11 --> 00:03:26.180
Brazil Spain and Sweden had the ability

88
00:03:23.81 --> 00:03:28.160
to develop these weapons however thanks

89
00:03:26.18 --> 00:03:30.290
to the NPT and international leverage

90
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:30.920
very few states are in possession of

91
00:03:30.29 --> 00:03:34.100
these weapons

92
00:03:30.92 --> 00:03:36.800
today the nuclear non-proliferation

93
00:03:34.1 --> 00:03:38.660
treaty established at the five permanent

94
00:03:36.8 --> 00:03:40.850
members of the Security Council which at

95
00:03:38.66 --> 00:03:44.000
first were the United States the Soviet

96
00:03:40.85 --> 00:03:47.090
Union China France and United Kingdom

97
00:03:44.0 --> 00:03:48.950
were the only nuclear powers and it

98
00:03:47.09 --> 00:03:53.240
forbade other states from acquiring

99
00:03:48.95 --> 00:03:54.860
nuclear weapons it exchanged the members

100
00:03:53.24 --> 00:03:57.170
of the nuclear Club the five nuclear

101
00:03:54.86 --> 00:03:59.120
powers would commit to help the rest of

102
00:03:57.17 --> 00:04:01.840
the countries develop nuclear energy for

103
00:03:59.12 --> 00:04:01.840
civil purposes

104
00:04:02.69 --> 00:04:05.700
however with time and despite all of

105
00:04:05.4 --> 00:04:07.470
this

106
00:04:05.7 --> 00:04:09.120
some countries have succeeded in

107
00:04:07.47 --> 00:04:10.860
becoming nuclear powers today besides

108
00:04:09.12 --> 00:04:12.540
the five powers previously mentioned

109
00:04:10.86 --> 00:04:14.970
four more countries have developed

110
00:04:12.54 --> 00:04:17.940
nuclear weapons that's Israel India

111
00:04:14.97 --> 00:04:19.920
Pakistan and North Korea and then was

112
00:04:17.94 --> 00:04:21.299
Iran which also tries you'll probably

113
00:04:19.92 --> 00:04:23.430
know that during the Ahmadinejad

114
00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.990
administration Iran tried to develop one

115
00:04:23.43 --> 00:04:26.760
of these bombs and this would have meant

116
00:04:24.99 --> 00:04:28.440
there would be a significant threat to

117
00:04:26.76 --> 00:04:30.180
both Israel as well as the Middle

118
00:04:28.44 --> 00:04:31.950
Eastern region but fortunately the

119
00:04:30.18 --> 00:04:33.540
international community took action to

120
00:04:31.95 --> 00:04:35.910
fight that possibility and the sanctions

121
00:04:33.54 --> 00:04:38.790
levels by the Security Council damaged

122
00:04:35.91 --> 00:04:40.380
Iran's oil and gas exports badly and all

123
00:04:38.79 --> 00:04:42.030
of that international pressure has an

124
00:04:40.38 --> 00:04:43.650
impact because in the next elections

125
00:04:42.03 --> 00:04:45.870
rouhani became the president of the

126
00:04:43.65 --> 00:04:48.630
country he was a more moderate candidate

127
00:04:45.87 --> 00:04:50.100
after very harsh negotiations in 2015

128
00:04:48.63 --> 00:04:52.170
they reached an agreement in which Iran

129
00:04:50.1 --> 00:04:53.850
stopped its nuclear agenda and in

130
00:04:52.17 --> 00:04:56.250
exchange the rest of the countries would

131
00:04:53.85 --> 00:04:57.900
lift sanctions on exports which was good

132
00:04:56.25 --> 00:05:00.210
news in the country like Iran where a

133
00:04:57.9 --> 00:05:02.340
lack of exports was causing significant

134
00:05:00.21 --> 00:05:04.710
damage to its economy well now we come

135
00:05:02.34 --> 00:05:07.290
to North Korea and maybe we should let

136
00:05:04.71 --> 00:05:09.270
it leader speak for himself Reedy and

137
00:05:07.29 --> 00:05:11.610
Kim Jong Jong turkey comes from one

138
00:05:09.27 --> 00:05:13.620
young you are today young lowered some

139
00:05:11.61 --> 00:05:15.480
glasses we don't exactly know what

140
00:05:13.62 --> 00:05:17.070
weapons North Korea possesses although

141
00:05:15.48 --> 00:05:19.320
some estimates say as we mentioned in a

142
00:05:17.07 --> 00:05:21.180
previous video that it's from 10 to 20

143
00:05:19.32 --> 00:05:23.250
bombs these are unsophisticated but

144
00:05:21.18 --> 00:05:25.620
still powerful enough to trigger a

145
00:05:23.25 --> 00:05:27.150
significant crisis for this reason the

146
00:05:25.62 --> 00:05:28.710
United Nations Security Council has

147
00:05:27.15 --> 00:05:30.600
strengthened the penalty system for

148
00:05:28.71 --> 00:05:33.950
North Korea after the last underground

149
00:05:30.6 --> 00:05:36.360
detonation in September of 2016

150
00:05:33.95 --> 00:05:37.620
the press has even dared to speculate

151
00:05:36.36 --> 00:05:39.780
that there might be preventative

152
00:05:37.62 --> 00:05:41.250
military action against North Korea by

153
00:05:39.78 --> 00:05:43.050
the Trump administration however

154
00:05:41.25 --> 00:05:45.060
American experts are warning this

155
00:05:43.05 --> 00:05:47.310
military action could trigger a military

156
00:05:45.06 --> 00:05:48.960
response with WMDs as well as

157
00:05:47.31 --> 00:05:50.790
conventional weaponry a war in the

158
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:52.200
Korean Peninsula would mean a human

159
00:05:50.79 --> 00:05:54.300
catastrophe and it would negatively

160
00:05:52.2 --> 00:05:56.460
affect the world's economy but it would

161
00:05:54.3 --> 00:05:58.710
most of all affect its neighbors China

162
00:05:56.46 --> 00:06:00.419
South Korea and Japan and the mere

163
00:05:58.71 --> 00:06:02.220
existence of this threat of war could

164
00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.690
lead to a terrifying arms race in the

165
00:06:02.22 --> 00:06:05.669
region and they could even make Japan

166
00:06:03.69 --> 00:06:06.750
take exceptional measures this is

167
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.970
something we've talked about in a

168
00:06:06.75 --> 00:06:10.800
previous video that you can see here

169
00:06:08.97 --> 00:06:12.110
that is why it's important for China to

170
00:06:10.8 --> 00:06:14.210
end its friendly

171
00:06:12.11 --> 00:06:16.010
ship with North Korea it's not going to

172
00:06:14.21 --> 00:06:22.820
end well for China or the world in

173
00:06:16.01 --> 00:06:24.800
general vertical non-proliferation well

174
00:06:22.82 --> 00:06:26.210
as the vertical non-proliferation during

175
00:06:24.8 --> 00:06:28.760
the Cold War the US and the Soviet

176
00:06:26.21 --> 00:06:31.130
Union's developed more and more powerful

177
00:06:28.76 --> 00:06:33.650
nuclear weapons in greater and greater

178
00:06:31.13 --> 00:06:35.360
numbers each country needed to have more

179
00:06:33.65 --> 00:06:37.550
and better weapons than the other so

180
00:06:35.36 --> 00:06:39.320
they store thousands and thousands of

181
00:06:37.55 --> 00:06:41.510
nuclear warheads they also increased

182
00:06:39.32 --> 00:06:43.370
their means of delivery aircraft missile

183
00:06:41.51 --> 00:06:48.200
submarines all to an extent that have

184
00:06:43.37 --> 00:06:51.080
previously not even been imagined during

185
00:06:48.2 --> 00:06:54.980
the Cold War arms race the global

186
00:06:51.08 --> 00:06:58.310
nuclear stockpile peaked in 1986 at

187
00:06:54.98 --> 00:06:59.810
about 70,000 nuclear warheads according

188
00:06:58.31 --> 00:07:02.060
to the Federation of American scientists

189
00:06:59.81 --> 00:07:06.230
enough to destroy the earth several

190
00:07:02.06 --> 00:07:08.090
times over in those years there are many

191
00:07:06.23 --> 00:07:10.460
tests with nuclear weapons conducted in

192
00:07:08.09 --> 00:07:12.830
the atmosphere in the sea in space and

193
00:07:10.46 --> 00:07:14.720
sometimes whether intentionally or not

194
00:07:12.83 --> 00:07:16.730
they use people as guinea pigs to

195
00:07:14.72 --> 00:07:19.340
analyze the effects of radioactivity in

196
00:07:16.73 --> 00:07:21.410
humans it was all a pretty terrible time

197
00:07:19.34 --> 00:07:23.060
the Japanese artist Hashimoto has

198
00:07:21.41 --> 00:07:29.960
prepared a video where you can see the

199
00:07:23.06 --> 00:07:31.810
different nuclear tests since 1945 it

200
00:07:29.96 --> 00:07:33.590
looks like a video game but it's not

201
00:07:31.81 --> 00:07:35.540
fortunately with the end of the Cold War

202
00:07:33.59 --> 00:07:37.730
the United States and Russia agreed to

203
00:07:35.54 --> 00:07:39.110
reduce their nuclear arsenals as well as

204
00:07:37.73 --> 00:07:41.660
their means of delivery are the

205
00:07:39.11 --> 00:07:43.940
President Obama in April 2010 the START

206
00:07:41.66 --> 00:07:46.220
treaty was signed in Prague this treaty

207
00:07:43.94 --> 00:07:49.250
aims to limit strategic weapons so each

208
00:07:46.22 --> 00:07:51.740
country would only hold 1500 nuclear

209
00:07:49.25 --> 00:07:54.140
bombers by the year 2018 but still that

210
00:07:51.74 --> 00:07:56.150
is way too many bombs there are also

211
00:07:54.14 --> 00:07:57.860
other rules to limit missiles and means

212
00:07:56.15 --> 00:07:59.960
of delivery and of course no more

213
00:07:57.86 --> 00:08:01.730
nuclear testing is permitted the ctvt is

214
00:07:59.96 --> 00:08:03.770
a treaty which completely forbids any

215
00:08:01.73 --> 00:08:05.990
nuclear tests and no more tests have

216
00:08:03.77 --> 00:08:07.910
been carried out since 1998 with the

217
00:08:05.99 --> 00:08:10.130
exception of course being North Korea

218
00:08:07.91 --> 00:08:12.320
anyway the conclusion of all of this is

219
00:08:10.13 --> 00:08:13.970
that yes we must definitely stop the

220
00:08:12.32 --> 00:08:16.340
proliferation of nuclear weapons in Iran

221
00:08:13.97 --> 00:08:18.080
or North Korea and we certainly have to

222
00:08:16.34 --> 00:08:20.540
prevent terrorist groups from laying

223
00:08:18.08 --> 00:08:22.550
their hands on these WMDs but the

224
00:08:20.54 --> 00:08:23.760
nuclear arsenals that still exists in

225
00:08:22.55 --> 00:08:25.800
the US and Russia

226
00:08:23.76 --> 00:08:27.660
also keep reducing because among other

227
00:08:25.8 --> 00:08:29.880
things the risk of misuse and lack of

228
00:08:27.66 --> 00:08:31.740
control of these weapons is always

229
00:08:29.88 --> 00:08:34.230
present in the world we inhabit today

230
00:08:31.74 --> 00:08:35.940
interdependence and globalized wars they

231
00:08:34.23 --> 00:08:38.010
don't make any sense but not really the

232
00:08:35.94 --> 00:08:41.700
North American strategist already said

233
00:08:38.01 --> 00:08:42.990
this after World War two thus far the

234
00:08:41.7 --> 00:08:45.030
chief purpose of our military

235
00:08:42.99 --> 00:08:48.060
establishment has been to win wars from

236
00:08:45.03 --> 00:08:51.270
now on its chief purpose must be to

237
00:08:48.06 --> 00:08:53.280
avert them in the u.s. President John F

238
00:08:51.27 --> 00:08:59.220
Kennedy was a pioneer in the search of

239
00:08:53.28 --> 00:09:01.080
peace and nuclear disarmament too many

240
00:08:59.22 --> 00:09:04.980
of us think it is impossible

241
00:09:01.08 --> 00:09:09.180
too many think it is unreal but that is

242
00:09:04.98 --> 00:09:12.200
a dangerous defeatist belief it leads to

243
00:09:09.18 --> 00:09:16.500
the conclusion that war is inevitable

244
00:09:12.2 --> 00:09:19.430
that mankind is doomed that we are

245
00:09:16.5 --> 00:09:23.010
gripped by forces we cannot control

246
00:09:19.43 --> 00:09:26.340
we need not accept that view our

247
00:09:23.01 --> 00:09:28.950
problems are man-made therefore they can

248
00:09:26.34 --> 00:09:34.090
be solved by man

249
00:09:28.95 --> 00:09:35.920

250
00:09:34.09 --> 00:09:38.080
in a world dominated by nuclear weapons

251
00:09:35.92 --> 00:09:39.550
Kennedy refused to conduct any nuclear

252
00:09:38.08 --> 00:09:41.290
tests in the atmosphere and he was

253
00:09:39.55 --> 00:09:43.240
criticized for that in his own country

254
00:09:41.29 --> 00:09:45.190
however we could have avoided so much

255
00:09:43.24 --> 00:09:47.020
suffering and saved a huge amount of

256
00:09:45.19 --> 00:09:49.720
money if the world had just listened to

257
00:09:47.02 --> 00:09:51.250
Kennedy's ideas on nuclear weapons so I

258
