3
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.719
in 2017 it'll be 70 years since India

4
00:00:10.95 --> 00:00:14.790
broke off from the British Empire and

5
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.190
became an independent country which is

6
00:00:14.79 --> 00:00:19.650
today actually the largest democracy in

7
00:00:17.19 --> 00:00:21.420
the world in these 70 years India has

8
00:00:19.65 --> 00:00:24.449
managed to implement a political system

9
00:00:21.42 --> 00:00:26.340
with more than 1,000 parties and - male

10
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.369
participation that is totally

11
00:00:26.34 --> 00:00:34.320
unprecedented in such a poor country of

12
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
course we should probably wait before we

13
00:00:34.32 --> 00:00:37.860
pop the champagne because we can't

14
00:00:35.79 --> 00:00:40.020
exactly say that these 70 years of

15
00:00:37.86 --> 00:00:42.329
Independence have gone brilliantly in

16
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:46.079
this gigantic country of more than 1.2

17
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.660
billion people poverty equality a

18
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.579
terrible caste system and many many

19
00:00:48.66 --> 00:00:53.370
problems with women's rights have

20
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.590
continued to shake this nation that and

21
00:00:53.37 --> 00:00:59.930
four wars with Pakistan which has become

22
00:00:55.59 --> 00:00:59.930
something of a arch enemy of India

23
00:01:00.51 --> 00:01:04.690
but if you really want to know why we

24
00:01:03.01 --> 00:01:07.270
might claim that India can't be proud of

25
00:01:04.69 --> 00:01:09.400
the last 70 years well we only need to

26
00:01:07.27 --> 00:01:12.100
compare this country's evolution with

27
00:01:09.4 --> 00:01:14.020
that of China see wen dong sharping

28
00:01:12.1 --> 00:01:15.970
launched his policy to open up China to

29
00:01:14.02 --> 00:01:18.280
the world and changed its economic model

30
00:01:15.97 --> 00:01:21.040
back in the 1980s the sizes of these two

31
00:01:18.28 --> 00:01:24.250
economic giants China and India they

32
00:01:21.04 --> 00:01:26.770
were similar in 2016 however China's GDP

33
00:01:24.25 --> 00:01:27.680
it was five times higher I mean just

34
00:01:26.77 --> 00:01:32.630
check out this graph

35
00:01:27.68 --> 00:01:34.670
[Music]

36
00:01:32.63 --> 00:01:37.189
and not only that these differences

37
00:01:34.67 --> 00:01:39.290
repeat in practically every statistic

38
00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.970
social and economic and how about

39
00:01:39.29 --> 00:01:42.799
another example well while China's

40
00:01:40.97 --> 00:01:44.390
illiteracy rate affects less than four

41
00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.399
percent of the population in China

42
00:01:44.39 --> 00:01:53.330
almost one out of every three people

43
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.470
can't read or write so considering all

44
00:01:53.33 --> 00:01:56.299
this we should almost reach the

45
00:01:54.47 --> 00:01:58.220
conclusion that the only good thing that

46
00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.470
this country is achieved has been its

47
00:01:58.22 --> 00:02:02.479
democracy right well just a second

48
00:02:00.47 --> 00:02:09.890
because it seems that this poverty and

49
00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.810
injustice is beginning to shift more and

50
00:02:09.89 --> 00:02:14.780
more experts are betting that the 21st

51
00:02:11.81 --> 00:02:16.489
century will be above all India century

52
00:02:14.78 --> 00:02:18.319
that is to say that in the next few

53
00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.120
decades we'll witness how this country

54
00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.640
emerges from the developing world to

55
00:02:20.12 --> 00:02:24.319
become an economic superpower many

56
00:02:22.64 --> 00:02:26.330
companies such as Amazon and Apple are

57
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.340
already betting on this transformation

58
00:02:26.33 --> 00:02:31.100
and to paying close attention to this

59
00:02:28.34 --> 00:02:33.440
huge market they understand that if

60
00:02:31.1 --> 00:02:35.299
expectations are met in the next few

61
00:02:33.44 --> 00:02:39.370
years we could see one of the biggest

62
00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.370
business opportunities in history

63
00:02:39.84 --> 00:02:43.860
and it's not just companies the Delhi

64
00:02:42.12 --> 00:02:45.660
government's own expectations are so

65
00:02:43.86 --> 00:02:47.459
high that they expect this country's

66
00:02:45.66 --> 00:02:49.290
transformation to be at least as

67
00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.610
impressive as that of China in the

68
00:02:49.29 --> 00:02:54.450
coming decades for this reason they want

69
00:02:53.61 --> 00:02:56.040
to be prepared

70
00:02:54.45 --> 00:02:58.590
they are contemplating for example

71
00:02:56.04 --> 00:03:00.540
building 250 airports six new macro

72
00:02:58.59 --> 00:03:02.910
reports and creating more than a hundred

73
00:03:00.54 --> 00:03:07.010
and fifty million new and accessible

74
00:03:02.91 --> 00:03:09.690
homes in the next ten years alone in

75
00:03:07.01 --> 00:03:12.180
other words everything indicates that we

76
00:03:09.69 --> 00:03:14.250
may see India's takeoff which well

77
00:03:12.18 --> 00:03:15.510
that's got to be a good thing right well

78
00:03:14.25 --> 00:03:17.459
do you keep one thing in mind and that

79
00:03:15.51 --> 00:03:20.239
is that Beijing doesn't like this they

80
00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.239
don't like it at all

81
00:03:23.16 --> 00:03:30.430
[Music]

82
00:03:26.74 --> 00:03:32.980
distrust and resentment

83
00:03:30.43 --> 00:03:35.500
China is India's main trading partner

84
00:03:32.98 --> 00:03:37.239
however despite this Chinese authorities

85
00:03:35.5 --> 00:03:39.610
look at India's growing economic

86
00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.620
political and military capacity with a

87
00:03:39.61 --> 00:03:43.180
lot of distrust this is because this is

88
00:03:41.62 --> 00:03:45.159
a time when China wants to gain

89
00:03:43.18 --> 00:03:47.260
political influence and this change in

90
00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.450
India it doesn't suit them at all India

91
00:03:47.26 --> 00:03:51.430
is perhaps the only country in Asia with

92
00:03:49.45 --> 00:03:53.319
enough potential to offset China's

93
00:03:51.43 --> 00:03:55.239
political power in the region after all

94
00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.040
we're talking about what will soon be

95
00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.870
the most populated country on earth and

96
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:00.189
there's even some analysts who confirm

97
00:03:58.87 --> 00:04:02.650
that maybe this has already happened

98
00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:05.170
that India has already surpassed China

99
00:04:02.65 --> 00:04:06.370
in terms of population size but it isn't

100
00:04:05.17 --> 00:04:08.230
only that because of the one-child

101
00:04:06.37 --> 00:04:10.959
policy that affected China for so many

102
00:04:08.23 --> 00:04:13.720
years India's population has and will

103
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.120
have more young people and less elderly

104
00:04:13.72 --> 00:04:18.160
people which is quite a significant

105
00:04:16.12 --> 00:04:19.180
advantage given these circumstances it's

106
00:04:18.16 --> 00:04:21.370
easy to understand

107
00:04:19.18 --> 00:04:24.570
Beijing's distrust of India don't you

108
00:04:21.37 --> 00:04:26.860
agree India has the fastest growing

109
00:04:24.57 --> 00:04:28.720
economy in the world we hope we're gonna

110
00:04:26.86 --> 00:04:30.490
be catching you very soon in terms of

111
00:04:28.72 --> 00:04:33.070
percentage increase I have to tell you

112
00:04:30.49 --> 00:04:35.289
that we're working on it now don't think

113
00:04:33.07 --> 00:04:37.270
that this feeling only exists in

114
00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.940
political offices not at all in fact

115
00:04:37.27 --> 00:04:41.139
this growing rivalry is actually also

116
00:04:39.94 --> 00:04:44.979
reflected on the streets

117
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.409
consider the following data according to

118
00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.050
a survey published in 2016 by the Pew

119
00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.599
Research Center only one in four Chinese

120
00:04:50.05 --> 00:04:53.919
people have a favorable opinion of India

121
00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.500
and in India things are not more

122
00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.570
encouraging 7 out of every 10 are

123
00:04:56.5 --> 00:04:59.979
worried about Beijing's military drive

124
00:04:58.57 --> 00:05:02.260
and believe that China's economic

125
00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.699
influence is hurting them in other words

126
00:05:02.26 --> 00:05:05.530
it seems that both China and India's

127
00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.180
populations know that their neighbors

128
00:05:05.53 --> 00:05:10.889
are also their great rivals

[Music]

130
00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.270
in any case Akira Slim must be said that

131
00:05:13.02 --> 00:05:17.099
despite all of this rivalry Bollywood is

132
00:05:15.27 --> 00:05:19.229
actually quite popular in China this

133
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.629
summer we saw how dongle and Indian

134
00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.460
blockbuster swept the chinese box office

135
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.759
and became one of the highest-grossing

136
00:05:23.46 --> 00:05:28.050
films in China of all time and well as

137
00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.240
you might imagine this is something that

138
00:05:28.05 --> 00:05:32.939
the government in Beijing they don't

139
00:05:30.24 --> 00:05:34.949
really like that much in terms of soft

140
00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.930
power India has done better than China

141
00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.939
although India's economy is not as

142
00:05:36.93 --> 00:05:41.639
developed they've put a huge emphasis on

Institute at Peking University well

146
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.039
anyway it would be great if all tensions

147
00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.159
occurred in let's say such a peaceful

148
00:05:50.039 --> 00:06:03.830
way but unfortunately that is not the

case disputes in Himalayas

150
00:06:03.83 --> 00:06:08.420
while everyone was looking at Pyongyang

00:06:05.96 --> 00:06:10.160
and the North Korean nuclear crisis

152
00:06:08.42 --> 00:06:11.990
occupied every France page another

political crisis when it was about to

explode it happens in the Himalayas more

155
00:06:16.55 --> 00:06:20.540
than four thousand meters above sea

between June and August one of the most

00:06:26.0 --> 00:06:30.980
serious political crises between China

161
00:06:28.46 --> 00:06:33.470
and India last 55 years occurred when

162
00:06:30.98 --> 00:06:36.290
Chinese troops invaded northern India

163
00:06:33.47 --> 00:06:38.330
see on June the 8th of 2017 a squad of

164
00:06:36.29 --> 00:06:39.800
Chinese border guards into construction

closed kingdom of Bhutan yes that is

Bhutan the country with the highest

169
00:06:46.46 --> 00:06:50.240
gross national happiness and yes that is

170
00:06:49.13 --> 00:06:52.190
something we will certainly be

171
00:06:50.24 --> 00:06:53.840
discussing in a video someday but well

172
00:06:52.19 --> 00:06:55.790
the fact is that the Chinese units

173
00:06:53.84 --> 00:06:58.340
destroyed several bunkers owned by the

174
00:06:55.79 --> 00:07:00.970
Bhutan royal army and they began to

175
00:06:58.34 --> 00:07:00.970
build a road

176
00:07:01.19 --> 00:07:05.700
however since butonce protection has

177
00:07:03.6 --> 00:07:07.920
been in India's hands since the 1940s

178
00:07:05.7 --> 00:07:10.380
Indian troops arrived on June the 16th

179
00:07:07.92 --> 00:07:14.470
and blocked the roads construction so

180
00:07:10.38 --> 00:07:16.760
far a pretty typical border conflict

181
00:07:14.47 --> 00:07:19.970
[Music]

182
00:07:16.76 --> 00:07:22.370
however tensions they didn't dilute they

183
00:07:19.97 --> 00:07:24.260
actually increased and the discussions

184
00:07:22.37 --> 00:07:26.270
between Beijing and New Delhi are they

185
00:07:24.26 --> 00:07:27.920
became quite tense chinese state media

186
00:07:26.27 --> 00:07:30.950
began to threaten the indian government

187
00:07:27.92 --> 00:07:33.860
with serious consequences china and

188
00:07:30.95 --> 00:07:36.440
india are dangerously close to military

189
00:07:33.86 --> 00:07:38.210
conflict in the himalayas now at this

190
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:39.770
point you might be wondering well why on

191
00:07:38.21 --> 00:07:41.450
earth was a land that is practically

192
00:07:39.77 --> 00:07:43.370
frozen for most of the year given such

193
00:07:41.45 --> 00:07:45.200
importance well on the one hand it seems

194
00:07:43.37 --> 00:07:47.540
that Xi Jinping's government wanted to

195
00:07:45.2 --> 00:07:49.220
test India and punish them for well a

196
00:07:47.54 --> 00:07:51.050
bunch of things for their relationship

197
00:07:49.22 --> 00:07:52.580
with the Dalai Lama and with Tibet for

198
00:07:51.05 --> 00:07:55.070
their growing ties with Washington for

199
00:07:52.58 --> 00:07:57.170
their relations with Pakistan and so on

200
00:07:55.07 --> 00:07:59.060
and with regard to India because China's

201
00:07:57.17 --> 00:08:00.920
control in this area with its military

202
00:07:59.06 --> 00:08:03.170
presence and new road would put China

203
00:08:00.92 --> 00:08:05.000
within a stone's throw of the Siliguri

204
00:08:03.17 --> 00:08:07.010
corridor a narrow strip of land

205
00:08:05.0 --> 00:08:09.230
considered strategic because it connects

206
00:08:07.01 --> 00:08:10.940
seven of the states of northeast India

207
00:08:09.23 --> 00:08:14.590
with the rest of the country this is

208
00:08:10.94 --> 00:08:14.590
something you'd see well on this map

209
00:08:17.36 --> 00:08:21.259
and above all beyond tanks Hill issues

210
00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:23.090
there's another important reason the

211
00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:24.590
same reason why China wanted to test

212
00:08:23.09 --> 00:08:28.789
India and you're going to see what I'm

213
00:08:24.59 --> 00:08:31.250
talking about in just a minute the fact

214
00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:33.019
is that finally on August the 28th after

215
00:08:31.25 --> 00:08:34.940
many threats and a lot of tension both

216
00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:36.860
sides agreed to withdraw their troops

217
00:08:34.94 --> 00:08:38.899
and return to the starting points of

218
00:08:36.86 --> 00:08:41.269
this entire political muddle of course

219
00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:43.399
years ago both powers rivalry wasn't as

220
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:45.140
obvious as it is now but of course let's

221
00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:47.450
not fool ourselves the dot-com plateau

222
00:08:45.14 --> 00:08:48.740
is well it's the least of it

223
00:08:47.45 --> 00:08:49.910
and I'm not just saying this because of

224
00:08:48.74 --> 00:08:52.070
the more than three thousand kilometers

225
00:08:49.91 --> 00:08:54.230
of border that have territorial disputes

226
00:08:52.07 --> 00:09:03.100
between China and India there are many

227
00:08:54.23 --> 00:09:05.899
many more reasons a national strategy

228
00:09:03.1 --> 00:09:06.589
given the possible emergence of India as

229
00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:08.360
a superpower

230
00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:10.399
the Chinese governments have adopted a

231
00:09:08.36 --> 00:09:12.560
strategy and that's just surrounds it

232
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.540
and yeah it's pretty much exactly what

233
00:09:12.56 --> 00:09:16.490
it sounds like in recent years China has

234
00:09:14.54 --> 00:09:18.620
tightened its ties with Pakistan in

235
00:09:16.49 --> 00:09:20.540
exchange for 60 billion dollars in

236
00:09:18.62 --> 00:09:22.670
infrastructure especially to connect

237
00:09:20.54 --> 00:09:24.800
both countries including a strategic

238
00:09:22.67 --> 00:09:26.740
port in Gwadar that China will operate

239
00:09:24.8 --> 00:09:31.850
until at least the year 2050

240
00:09:26.74 --> 00:09:31.850
[Music]

241
00:09:33.03 --> 00:09:36.870
on the other hand a Chinese government

242
00:09:34.86 --> 00:09:38.850
company has taken control of ham bento

243
00:09:36.87 --> 00:09:40.800
support in Sri Lanka a country with

244
00:09:38.85 --> 00:09:42.840
which Beijing is also strengthening its

245
00:09:40.8 --> 00:09:45.030
political ties regarding Bangladesh

246
00:09:42.84 --> 00:09:47.010
China has become his most important arms

247
00:09:45.03 --> 00:09:49.380
supplier last year they sold them to

248
00:09:47.01 --> 00:09:50.880
submarines and finally there's Nepal

249
00:09:49.38 --> 00:09:52.530
which has greatly improved its

250
00:09:50.88 --> 00:09:54.990
relationship with China after a

251
00:09:52.53 --> 00:09:56.760
political conflict in 2015 with New

252
00:09:54.99 --> 00:09:58.940
Delhi now well let's have a look at a

253
00:09:56.76 --> 00:09:58.940
map

254
00:10:02.19 --> 00:10:07.500
you see India is surrounded

255
00:10:08.13 --> 00:10:13.570
bouton crisis it was simply nothing more

256
00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:15.220
than a move in a chess game and this is

257
00:10:13.57 --> 00:10:17.709
a chess game in which China has the

258
00:10:15.22 --> 00:10:20.019
economic capacity tons the money to make

259
00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:21.459
friends very easily and of course the

260
00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:24.279
fact that China's military superiority

261
00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:26.709
over India is overwhelming well that's

262
00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:28.779
also very helpful so a question that

263
00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:31.240
might arise after all of this is well

264
00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:33.160
what's India's bet or rather what's

265
00:10:31.24 --> 00:10:34.930
their realistic response and well that

266
00:10:33.16 --> 00:10:36.970
response it basically comes in three

267
00:10:34.93 --> 00:10:41.380
words and those three words are the

268
00:10:36.97 --> 00:10:42.670
United States yeah as you heard it in

269
00:10:41.38 --> 00:10:44.260
recent years relations between the

270
00:10:42.67 --> 00:10:47.769
United States and India have become

271
00:10:44.26 --> 00:10:50.230
pretty close see between 2009 and 2016

272
00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:52.360
bilateral trade has doubled and the sale

273
00:10:50.23 --> 00:10:57.279
of military equipment from the United

274
00:10:52.36 --> 00:10:59.320
States to India has multiplied by 50 in

275
00:10:57.279 --> 00:11:01.690
fact everything indicates that India is

276
00:10:59.32 --> 00:11:04.050
going to replace their old mig-21 with a

277
00:11:01.69 --> 00:11:06.910
mega contract of newly manufactured

278
00:11:04.05 --> 00:11:08.950
f-16s 200 of them and if this is

279
00:11:06.91 --> 00:11:10.510
confirmed Lockheed Martin's intention

280
00:11:08.95 --> 00:11:12.490
the manufacturer with Pentagon's

281
00:11:10.51 --> 00:11:14.740
approval of course is to transfer this

282
00:11:12.49 --> 00:11:17.020
planes worldwide production from Texas

283
00:11:14.74 --> 00:11:20.579
to India a pretty unbeatable way to

284
00:11:17.02 --> 00:11:23.320
strengthened alliances don't you think

285
00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:25.089
well now we can better understand not

286
00:11:23.32 --> 00:11:27.220
only China and India's tense

287
00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:29.230
relationship but also for example the

288
00:11:27.22 --> 00:11:31.060
u.s. is new hard strategy towards

289
00:11:29.23 --> 00:11:33.000
Pakistan which we discussed in our

290
00:11:31.06 --> 00:11:35.950
previous video about Afghanistan

291
00:11:33.0 --> 00:11:38.880
[Music]

292
00:11:35.95 --> 00:11:41.260
[Applause]

293
00:11:38.88 --> 00:11:43.240
and of course all of this starts based

294
00:11:41.26 --> 00:11:45.370
on a premise that India will emulate the

295
00:11:43.24 --> 00:11:47.830
economic success that China has achieved

296
00:11:45.37 --> 00:11:49.780
in recent decades Narendra Modi

297
00:11:47.83 --> 00:11:51.610
the popular Indian prime minister of

298
00:11:49.78 --> 00:11:53.950
whom we already talked about is leading

299
00:11:51.61 --> 00:11:56.320
many changes but not as many as the

300
00:11:53.95 --> 00:11:58.240
country needs but that is a discussion

301
00:11:56.32 --> 00:11:59.980
we can leave for another day and now we

302
00:11:58.24 --> 00:12:02.290
want to know do you think China will

303
00:11:59.98 --> 00:12:04.120
succeed in beating India well please do
