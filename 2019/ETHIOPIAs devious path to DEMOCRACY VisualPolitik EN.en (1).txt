00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,360
Ethiopia is a country famous for being

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,130
the home of the coffee plants however

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,139
Ethiopians themselves didn't start

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,849
drinking it until very recently the

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,980
countless decades this country was among

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,770
the world's poorest but if you followed

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,420
visual politic for a while you already

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,369
know that Ethiopia was blessed with one

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,230
of the greatest miracles of the time

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,460
[Music]

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,160
in recent decades Ethiopia is grown at a

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,740
rate of 10% year after year in this

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,930
country fashion brands like Calvin Klein

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,390
and H&M have opened large textile

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,340
workshops and Chinese factories are

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,530
being built along the outskirts of Addis

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,470
Ababa at a startling pace but the

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,110
Chinese are not the only ones interested

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,780
in making money in Ethiopia at the

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,300
beginning of 2019 high-end eye opens

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,129
their first assembly plants here in

24
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,140
other words more and more Ethiopians are

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,809
stepping out of poverty every day but

26
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,520
hold on for just a second because this

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,210
isn't actually the Ethiopian miracle you

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,149
see until the year 2018 the economy was

29
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:14,430
doing well but the political system it

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,770
kind of sucked they had an authoritarian

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,290
system just like that of the Chinese

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,720
Communist Party one party that was

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,460
censorship and was never-ending

34
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,320
harassment and abuse of ethnic

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,690
minorities but one day against all odds

36
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,970
something shocking happens and a lot

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,800
changed thanks to the man that you see

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,300
on screen right now

39
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,060
this man is Adi ahmed ali the brand's

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,979
new Ethiopian Prime Minister and I say

41
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,290
against all odds because ABI Achmed Ali

42
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,479
was the last person you would imagine to

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,970
be a reformist he was an Army General

44
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,890
and a member of the establishment party

45
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,840
the Ethiopian People's Liberation Front

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,930
stream

47
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,340
however as soon as this man took a step

48
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,500
into office as Prime Minister he started

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,369
rocking the boat

50
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,960
from one day to the next he abolished

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,210
most of the censorship laws bans the

52
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,860
harassment of minority groups by the

53
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,750
army and announced free elections by

54
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,460
2020 and to this the peace with

55
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,590
neighboring Eritrea he negotiated and

56
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,420
the liberalisation agenda that sounds

57
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,220
like heaven to international investors

58
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,160
and well yes it might be the case that

59
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,989
he gets the chance to receive a Nobel

60
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:18,880
Peace Prize he definitely already

61
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,400
deserves it much more than many others

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,110
who've received it but hold on a minute

63
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,850
because believe it or not in Ethiopia

64
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,350
not everything is sunshine and rainbows

65
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,900
YES on paper the intentions of this

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,390
politician couldn't sound better if he

67
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,130
achieves everything he wants he would

68
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,260
become an easy-open national hero for

69
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,450
generations to come and a symbol of

70
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,340
democracy in Africa but as we always say

71
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,590
here on visual politics things are a bit

72
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,560
more complicated than they seem

Ethiopia's Amhara state chief killed

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
amid regional coup attempt yep you heard

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,090
that right democratic transitions are

77
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,709
never easy especially considering that

78
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,079
Ethiopia already has a political elite

79
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,549
enjoying the privileges of the

80
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,290
establishments and more than 13

81
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,790
different distinct and divided

82
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,920
ethnicities we are talking about an

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,269
enormous country of more than a hundred

84
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,220
million people speaking more than 13

85
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,579
languages this is a test - Adi Ahmed

86
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,739
real intentions with so much opposition

87
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,840
and so much ethnic tension and conflict

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,760
it's very tempting to go back to the

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,590
good old days of dictatorship at the end

90
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,389
of the day tyrants can deal with such

91
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,790
disorder much more easily so to what

92
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,459
extent is avi Achmed really willing to

93
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,350
respect human rights Kerry Theo Pia

94
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,930
become an actual democracy or maybe it's

95
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,329
too hard to just resist the temptation

96
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,680
of becoming an authoritarian

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,720
dictatorship again well today we are

98
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,829
going to answer all of these questions

99
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,989
but before we do let's take a look back

100
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,460
at the history

101
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,939
[Music]

102
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:47,790
the country of three revolutions many of

103
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,260
you might associate Ethiopia with

104
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,390
Rastafarians as you know Bob Marley and

105
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,220
his acolytes practiced a religion that

106
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,709
revered Haile Selassie the Ethiopian

107
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:57,720
Emperor not to offend the Rastafarians

108
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,299
but Emperor Selassie was an absolute

109
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,400
monarch that ruled Ethiopia with an iron

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,049
fist and as it tends to be with

111
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,690
absolutist leaders he didn't die in met

112
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,400
in the year 1975 a guerrilla

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,890
organization known as the Derg seized

114
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,900
power and slew him at the ripe old age

115
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,569
of 83 after 35 years of rule this was

116
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:17,250
the first Ethiopian Revolution

117
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,079
revolutions rarely go as well as plans

118
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,479
though but even more rarely do they go

119
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,000
as horrible as they did in Ethiopia the

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,860
Derg was a Marxist Leninist group that

121
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,930
governs the country during the 1980s in

122
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,550
this time they collectivized lands

123
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,680
nationalized all the companies and began

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
what would become known as the gays

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,910
shibir or the Ethiopian red terror which

126
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,470
resulted in half a million dead

127
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,479
political dissidents horrible policies

128
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,310
mixed with low rainfall resulted in one

129
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,870
of the worst famines in Ethiopian

130
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,090
history

131
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,210
[Music]

132
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,140
subsequently another uprising occurred

133
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,690
in 1991 after a bloody civil war the

134
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,580
Ethiopian People's Liberation Front took

135
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,130
power this was the second Ethiopian

136
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,880
Revolution

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,710
unfortunately this revolution it wasn't

138
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,690
very liberal either they went from a

139
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,640
pure communism to a Mulder one with

140
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,470
Chinese characteristics and it's the

141
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,060
good relationship between these two

142
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,830
countries and the country's economic

143
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,780
growth but pay attention because now

144
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,430
Eric is going to tell us the really

145
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,080
interesting part of the story

146
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,300
you see Ethiopia has more than 100

147
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,790
million citizens and over 13 tribes

148
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,560
these tribes are not always very

149
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,150
friendly with one another and that's why

150
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,580
the Constitution is so special

151
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,890
start with Ethiopia is the only country

152
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,020
on earth besides Liechtenstein where the

153
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,090
right to secession is part of the

154
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,590
Constitution this means that

155
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,810
theoretically each of these nine regions

156
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,310
you see on the map could have a

157
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,470
referendum and become independent each

158
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,240
of these ethnicities has their own

159
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,290
political party

160
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,360
most of these political parties are part

161
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,950
of this grand coalition called the

162
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,990
Ethiopian People's Liberation of France

163
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,240
all these parties have seats in the

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
parliaments all of this means that

165
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,660
Ethiopian politics are not a debate

166
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,340
between right and left wing or

167
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,710
conservative versus liberal instead it's

168
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,930
a debate amongst squabbling tribes and

169
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,850
you might wonder does the system work

170
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,740
can Ethiopians but assign their

171
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,480
differences and coexist in peace and

172
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,630
harmony and the answer well no first of

173
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,880
all this right to secession is just a

174
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,330
theory

175
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,190
each time a region wanted to secede they

176
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,350
had to face the army and as you can

177
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,450
imagine not all tribes are equal

178
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,390
from those 13 ethnic groups only 3 call

179
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,880
the shot the Oromo the 'm hara and the

180
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,800
Tyrians

181
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,690
the rest are suffering constant human

182
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,760
rights violations these include but are

183
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,740
not limited to force displacements land

184
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,600
confiscations and of course the

185
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,430
occasional slaughter for example these

186
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,050
Somalians living in ethiopia have been

187
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,610
suffering neverending abuses by

188
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,560
paramilitary groups and of course both

189
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,360
the government and the military deny

190
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,130
such things if that wasn't enough easy

191
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,590
opa was in a seemingly endless war with

192
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,020
Eritrea a region that succeeded in

193
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,850
secession only through force

194
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,370
so yes the economy was doing well but

195
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,810
the political situation it could hardly

196
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,910
be worse this all set the stage for the

197
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,040
third Ethiopian revolution so let's have

198
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,160
a look at that shall we

199
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,419
[Music]

200
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,790
the Ethiopian rock star I'm gonna say it

201
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,150
again

202
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,680
remember this name because he might one

203
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
day win a Nobel Peace Prize

204
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,840
howdy Ahmed Ali until 2018 he was what

205
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,150
we call an apparatchik this is a party

206
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,580
man an army general that belonged to an

207
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,590
Oromo tribe as he said before these are

208
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,060
one of the ruling ethnic groups

209
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,770
nevertheless as soon as he started his

210
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,419
administration he unleashed one of the

211
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,280
most ambitious reformist agendas in

212
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,470
history in one year he signed a peace

213
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,540
treaty with Eritrea abolished censorship

214
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,580
and has blocked abuses by the military

215
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,320
Ahn's impressed yes well just wait

216
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,790
because we haven't finished he has

217
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,470
already announced free elections managed

218
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,390
to get a woman as president since is

219
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,400
passing the biggest liberalisation ever

220
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,930
seen in Ethiopia

221
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,210
Ethiopia to install 4G network ahead of

222
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,250
telecoms liberalisation with all of this

223
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,020
is easy to understand why is the come

224
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,000
the new African rock star in fact we can

225
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,949
already talk about Abbey mania and

226
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,229
believe me everything I say here is not

227
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,970
hyperbole at all some religious groups

228
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,130
already claim that he is the Messiah

229
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,110
feats that he shares with the late Haile

230
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,180
Selassie in Eritrea the former diehard

231
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,949
enemy of Ethiopia there are already

232
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,630
mothers naming their children after him

233
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,210
not to mention the Ethiopian media is

234
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:19,030
having a big time Renaissance satire is

235
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,889
flourishing in Ethiopia brand-new

236
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,870
newspapers brand-new TV shows an exiled

237
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,550
journalists coming back to the country

238
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,259
the pictures you see now a part of a

239
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,789
comedy sketch that you can find on

240
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:29,380
YouTube for the first time in Ethiopian

241
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,759
history people could make fun of

242
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,469
politicians including the Prime Minister

243
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,390
and it seems that next year Ethiopian

244
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,219
broadcaster will start a late-night show

245
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:37,330
similar to the Daily Show

246
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,979
all of this is pretty normal in a

247
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,380
country like America or the UK but it is

248
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,729
a giant step here

249
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,140
but okay okay I know what you're gonna

250
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,360
say now it's easy to allow free press

251
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,980
when the media loves you but what

252
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,959
happens when you have diehard critics

253
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:56,260
well let's cover that now freedom has

254
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,680
its risks 2019 surprised Ethiopians with

255
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
a terrible drought that brought many

256
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,850
regions to the brink of starvation

257
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,050
unemployment is near 20 percent and many

258
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,100
young people are in a desperate

259
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,170
situation if that wasn't enough the old

260
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,060
guard is far from happy with this third

261
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,089
revolution see what happens in June 2019

262
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,829
is the open army chief killed by

263
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,079
bodyguard and regional leader dead in

264
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,329
coup attempt the um Hara state president

265
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,660
mbaku Makonnen and his advisor were shot

266
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,459
dead and the state's attorney general

267
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,860
was wounded in Amar's capital basically

268
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,569
a man from the military who belongs to

269
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,519
the Amara tribe decided to kill the

270
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,110
governor of his region according to him

271
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,639
maybe Achmed was ending all the

272
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,470
privileges that his tribe used to enjoy

273
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,970
so he organized a coup d'etat to

274
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,769
separate from the rest of the country as

275
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,149
you can imagine the central government

276
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,459
did not wait to retaliate Ethiopia

277
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:51,889
security forces kill alleged coup leader

278
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,269
but we're not talking about a military

279
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:55,220
answer only for almost two days the

280
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,689
central government cut access to the

281
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:58,579
internet and just like that for the next

282
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:01,040
48 hours Ethiopians nationwide didn't

283
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,899
have any internet access this way the

284
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,879
citizenry couldn't visit any media or

285
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,860
any site with a critical opinion of the

286
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,720
government so yeah I can probably tell

287
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,189
you're thinking freedom of speech didn't

288
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:12,709
last long at all but if you thought this

289
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,360
was the only problem that he has one you

290
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,829
better think again

291
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,839
Ethiopia referendum dozens killed in

292
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,970
Sudama clashes with so much freedom the

293
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,709
Sudama tribe one of those groups that

294
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:26,569
have always been marginalized by the

295
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,459
powers that be decided to call for an

296
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,439
independence referendum they don't want

297
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:31,939
to become an independent country but

298
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:33,350
rather they wanted to have their own

299
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,929
autonomous region within Ethiopia like

300
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,149
some larger ethnic groups have this is

301
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:39,619
what happens when you give freedom to

302
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,299
the people people want to use that

303
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,100
freedom and at this moment the guys from

304
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,480
the Ethiopian government said

305
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,980
essentially well these guys are a

306
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,079
massive pain in the ass okay so you

307
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,730
sudharma guys do what you want you want

308
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,220
to referendum fine but can you wait five

309
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,470
months just just hold on five months and

310
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,660
then the Sudama tribe said oh yeah just

311
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,309
five months your wages five months I

312
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,419
mean you just sound like the previous

313
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:00,769
government guys you talk about democracy

314
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,899
you talk about freedom all that sweet

315
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,790
stuff but then you go around with

316
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,069
referendums you can take your five

317
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,079
months waiting time and you can stick it

318
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,179
up your ops and that is how violent

319
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,220
protests ending with over 30 deaths

320
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,600
happen certainly guess what you're

321
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,309
thinking this abbey ahmed guy that's

322
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,230
pretty disappointing but well sometimes

323
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,920
history can be really beautiful

324
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,100
[Music]

325
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,959
Ethiopia to hold autonomy referendum for

326
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,209
ethnic Sudama in November yes after much

327
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:29,250
hesitation avi Achmed is really willing

328
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,990
to allow that referendum coupled with

329
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,610
the internet already working again it

330
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,769
seems that freedom of speech is alive in

331
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,660
Ethiopia for example while we were

332
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,100
preparing this video we found some

333
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,959
English speaking Ethiopian newspapers

334
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,029
and we could find news pieces like this

335
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,010
one Sudama unrest toll rises to 34 I

336
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,690
know this is really bad news this is the

337
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,220
kind of news that doesn't paint a nice

338
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,050
portion of the government but that's

339
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,180
precisely it the fact that an Ethiopian

340
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,920
newspaper can now say bad things about

341
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,690
the government is an amazing thing good

342
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,130
luck finding something similar in China

343
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,380
for a better understanding do HVL which

344
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,540
is a radio program similar to the BBC

345
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,279
but in germany has already started

346
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,470
broadcasting in Amharic language and

347
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,329
look at the kind of talk shows that they

348
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,230
already are hosting discussion country

349
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,240
risk they began to hear warnings that

350
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,700
Ethiopia was endangered as a country

351
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,709
unfortunately we don't really know what

352
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,940
they are discussing in this talk show

353
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,920
because we couldn't find an Ethiopian

354
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,110
who could help us so far Abby is giving

355
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,660
us promise of free elections by 2020 of

356
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,250
course this will not be an easy thing

357
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,930
first of all Ethiopia will have to

358
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,850
perform a new census which is extremely

359
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,950
hard to do rather despite the growth

360
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,079
this is still a very poor country and

361
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,670
the government has a lot of challenges

362
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,500
ahead of it starting with the huge

363
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,240
unemployment rate so the question goes

364
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,010
to you should Ethiopia be able to hold

365
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,620
these elections by 2020 will a bee fall

366
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,510
to the temptations of the fruits of

367
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,529
authoritarianism

368
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,120
also is Ethiopia ready for democracy

369
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,740
well please leave your answer in the

370
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,390
comment section below also do visit our

371
