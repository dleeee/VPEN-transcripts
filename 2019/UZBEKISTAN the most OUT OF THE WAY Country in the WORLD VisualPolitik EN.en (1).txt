1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,740
it's one of the most obscure forgotten

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,810
and unknown countries in the world's one

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,879
to test this allow me to ask you three

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,649
questions one have you ever heard of us

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,360
Backus dong - would you know where to

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,309
find it on a map and three could you

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,170
name its capital if you answered all

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,240
three questions correctly

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
congratulations you're an expert in

10
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,250
international geography

11
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,890
if not then worry it's not unusual and

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,150
today you'll have the chance to discover

13
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,070
many more curious facts because dear

14
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,140
viewers today on visual politic we're

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,810
talking about his megastar

16
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,350
[Applause]

17
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:40,190
[Music]

18
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,960
it may not be very popular with tourists

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,160
but with more than 30 million

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,720
inhabitants as Pakistan is the most

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,790
populous country in Central Asia it's

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,040
also incredibly young that's young in

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,540
both senses of the words not only

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,800
because one out of every three

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,809
inhabitants is under the age of fourteen

26
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,700
but also because the country was part of

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,739
the former Soviet Union so modern as

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,820
Becca Stan is only 28 years old and

29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,940
Aviva

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,920
it's a remote country it's so isolated

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,330
from the rest of the world that on top

32
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,130
of having no access to the sea like

33
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,140
Liechtenstein it's the only country on

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,060
the entire planet that is surrounded by

35
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,830
countries that don't have access to the

36
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,590
sea either and it's natives they're

37
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,080
pretty obscured to Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,220
Turkmenistan Kazakhstan and Afghanistan

39
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,780
well I suppose the last one there is

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,910
very well known but not for good reasons

41
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,100
anyway as you can see if you want to

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,540
have an adventure in the 21st century

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,030
typical of an explorer get away from the

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,009
known worlds and feel like David

45
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,500
Livingstone or even Marco Polo then you

46
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,180
could go to us Becca Stan the focus

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,100
obviously this isn't a travel ad so is a

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,600
question why on earth you think we're

49
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,370
talking about is Becca Stan on a visual

50
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,740
politic any ideas well what if I told

51
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,630
you that this country is at an

52
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,860
interesting crossroads

53
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,140
[Music]

54
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,430
you see as mega stone is a country

55
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,620
roughly the size of California but it's

56
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,160
only got 1.5 percent of California's GDP

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,810
it's a country where only 1 in every 3

58
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,729
inhabitants lives in a city and it has

59
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,470
to make a very important decision it

60
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,030
needs to decide whether to commit itself

61
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,580
to a full reform program that will set

62
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,770
it on a path to becoming a 21st century

63
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,150
economy once and for all or

64
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,950
alternatively retreats back into

65
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,140
obscurity from the rest of the world and

66
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,180
the what can I say here on this channel

67
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,620
but we love this sort of thing in this

68
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,970
video we're gonna see what's happening

69
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,950
in Uzbekistan but first we need to

70
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,380
introduce you to a leading character so

71
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,930
have you heard of Islam Karimov well

72
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,960
listen up

73
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,370
[Applause]

74
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,010
[Music]

75
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,370
every hand full pockets

76
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,530
sometimes everything changes and yet

77
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,480
things remain practically the same and

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,860
that's exactly what happened in

79
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,170
Uzbekistan in 1991 when the country

80
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,880
declared its independence from the

81
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,170
crumbling Soviet Union at that time the

82
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,390
man on the screen now Islam Karimov was

83
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,950
the general secretary of the communist

84
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,810
party in his mecca stand as well as the

85
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,120
president of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,730
Republic and of course if he had all the

87
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,620
power why should he let any of it go and

88
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,519
that's the question

89
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,440
Karimov must have asked himself and not

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,010
surprisingly while he decided not to

91
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,580
[Music]

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,800
on April the 1st 1991 when it wasn't yet

93
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,570
clear if the Soviet Union would end up

94
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,160
disintegrating karimov saw his

95
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,660
opportunity and declared the

96
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,400
independence of us Pakistan on December

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,500
the 29th of the last same year elections

98
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,100
were held

99
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,480
they were so fortunate that they would

100
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,490
make even nicolas maduro looked like a

101
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,490
democrats Karimov got 88 percent of the

102
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,200
votes and from then on you know what

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,210
while the results they kept on improving

104
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,560
asmath managed to maintain a

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,360
suspiciously high percentage of the

106
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,790
votes in subsequent elections he only

107
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,950
needed to make a call to the electoral

108
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,900
board and dictate the results of the

109
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,970
elections all before they were even held

110
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,790
of course once that was done the deal it

111
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,470
was sealed

112
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,780
[Music]

113
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,490
the upshot folks is that during his 25

114
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,769
long years in power Islam Karimov became

115
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,320
the master of his Pakistan he was one of

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,750
the most ruthless tyrants on the planet

117
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,280
a guy who had no qualms saying something

118
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,250
publicly like this I'm prepared to rip

119
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,590
off the heads of 200 people to sacrifice

120
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,140
their lives in order to preserve peace

121
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,680
and calm in the Republic Karimov

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
oversaw truly terrible human rights

123
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,210
abuses for over 25 years

124
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,070
as the news Beck president hugh

125
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:49,130
williamson Human Rights Watch

126
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,380
during his years in power vac media

127
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,000
censorship was one of these strictest in

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,720
the world arrests and convictions of

129
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,980
journalists and social and political

130
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,020
activists were an everyday event and the

131
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,700
police and Secret Service used torture

132
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:11,750
as part of their normal protocol of

133
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,580
course as a result nobody knows Becca

134
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,410
Stan dared to speak ill of the president

135
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,510
in addition Kerimov regularly used

136
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,250
expropriation as a mechanism to

137
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,510
consolidate his power

138
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,670
yeah sorry Hugo Chavez you weren't an

139
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,140
innovator in their field you were kind

140
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,670
of more like an apprentice he also

141
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,050
maintained a lot of the economic

142
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,700
policies that he had learned during the

143
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,500
Soviet era policies such as currency

144
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,570
controls completely artificial official

145
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,250
exchange rates a huge amount of state

146
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,920
interference in the economy and more and

147
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,930
more stuff like that furthermore he

148
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,460
increased the country's isolation by

149
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,350
having terrible relationships with most

150
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,130
of us Beca Stan's and neighbors all this

151
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,770
explains why under his rule the majority

152
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,510
of the population was poor

153
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,730
seriously poor even though as becca stan

154
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,770
is rich in hydrocarbons and mineral

155
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,540
resources for example it has the third

156
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,620
largest gold reserves in the world by

157
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,060
the way we can't give you poverty

158
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,650
statistics because the Uzbek government

159
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,720
officially determined by law that there

160
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,090
is no poverty in the country and if it

161
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,770
doesn't exist well then of course it

162
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,479
can't be measured

163
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,789
to give you an idea they consider that

164
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,029
the average salary is $225 per month the

165
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,379
jobs that are paid according to the

166
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,479
official regulations and of course for

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,980
under-the-table jobs it's even lower

168
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,960
and as you can imagine caramels family

169
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
and in a circle they've accumulated an

170
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,010
immense fortune Carroll's own daughters

171
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,570
have visited the most glamorous places

172
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,560
in the world have shared experiences

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,630
with Hollywood a-listers have released

174
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,700
albums jewelry lines perfumes they've

175
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,560
just done whatever they want really but

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,330
folks perhaps the best way to see how

177
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,550
immensely tyrannical despotic and

178
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,710
autocratic caramel's government was is

179
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,660
by taking a look at what was happening

180
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,850
in the cotton sector this is

181
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,410
traditionally the most important

182
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,180
economic activity in the country

183
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:01,510
[Music]

184
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,640
this is because Pakistan is actually one

185
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,170
of the largest cotton producers in the

186
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,150
world so can you imagine a country where

187
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,310
every year the leader enslaves a very

188
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,780
significant percentage of the population

189
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,300
to work for him and now don't be fooled

190
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,310
this time we aren't talking about taxes

191
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:22,090
we're talking about forced labor well

192
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,950
that's exactly what's happening with us

193
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,460
Becca Stan each year between September

194
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,140
and November to collect the cotton

195
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,970
harvest the government mobilizes between

196
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,070
1 and 2 million people in virtual

197
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,350
slavery conditions to avoid going you

198
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,700
had to send someone else in your place

199
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,010
or face the consequences most were

200
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,630
public servants such as doctors and

201
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,280
teachers or workers from companies that

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,140
were contracted by the government yep

203
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,920
you heard that right

204
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,690
in fact a lot of hospitals were left

205
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,490
practically without doctors because the

206
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,370
government had sent them to pick cotton

207
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,870
you come to work with all the makeup

208
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,570
wearing nice clothes good shoes and the

209
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,550
polyclinic director runs and says I need

210
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,560
40 people in the field the buses outside

211
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,060
hurry hurry

212
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,440
doctor Kido yadava to the New York Times

213
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,060
cotton is mandatory for everyone the

214
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,770
government gave orders to pick and you

215
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,600
will not go against these orders if I

216
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,460
refuse they will fire me we would lose

217
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,800
the bread we eat an Uzbek schoolteacher

218
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,510
and that's not the rest of it for many

219
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,220
years a lot of these workers were

220
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,080
children who had stopped going to school

221
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,060
in order to pick cotton for thin

222
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,570
governments

223
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,130
[Music]

224
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,710
the system it worked like this the farm

225
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,450
has received free labor and then sold

226
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,919
the cotton to the government at a very

227
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,900
low price then the government sold it to

228
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,610
textile companies or exported it to

229
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,530
produce clothes all over the world at a

230
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,120
price far greater than what they paid

231
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,130
the farmers in that way cotton became

232
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,410
one of the largest sources of government

233
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,510
revenue anyway as you can see Geron off

234
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,630
he didn't fool around

235
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,040
perhaps another example of how despotic

236
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,870
and authoritarian Karimov was can be

237
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,730
found in how he treated his own daughter

238
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,980
see kerim OVA was so to speak his

239
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,940
favorite daughter

240
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,920
there was even speculation that she

241
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,450
would be his heir she lived life to the

242
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,130
fullest surrounded by luxuries and

243
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,600
celebrities and was very popular among

244
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,410
jet-setters

245
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,510
among how many activities she was even

246
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,730
once ambassador to Spain well it turns

247
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,710
out that Guerra mova caused a huge

248
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,150
problem for the us-backed governments

249
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,380
because she had been dealing with

250
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,180
hundreds of millions of dollars for

251
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,830
international companies in exchange for

252
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,110
false concessions in his Pakistan and

253
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,820
then to top it off she argued with and

254
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,380
publicly confronted her mother and

255
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,330
brother and well that was simply too

256
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:35,870
much

257
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,640
one fine day Karen off sent the secret

258
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
police to his daughter's house with a

259
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,950
mission typical of Hollywood movies

260

[Music]

261
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,050

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,310
carryovers house throwing themselves

263
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,710
from helicopters with ropes quarter and

264
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,570
they locked her in a room in a mansion

265
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,220
Karam over one of the richest women in

266
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,110
the world never saw her father again and

267
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,300
nobody has seen her in public since we

268
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,650
know that she's been transferred to an

269
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,360
Uzbek prison the trial that condemned

270
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,070
her it was held in her own kitchen

271
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,440
as I said before Karimov he does not

272
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:12,480
fool around surprised well despite all

273
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,130
of this the truth is that Karimov was a

274
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,750
good ally of the West especially the

275
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,850
United States and probably there we need

276
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,950
to hold up a second because I mean how

277
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,050
could Western countries ally themselves

278
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:28,680
with such a tyrant well let's just say

279
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,230
there are two very compelling reasons on

280
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,670
the one hand as Pakistan is a

281
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,650
predominantly Muslim country despite

282
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,360
this Karimov government was strongly

283
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,520
opposed to radical Islamists and has

284
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,110
persecuted them with the same heavy

285
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,910
hands with which it kept its people

286
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,980
subjugated well probably an even heavier

287
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,990
hand actually evidently Karimov didn't

288
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,280
take this line due to personal

289
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,290
conviction religious tolerance or to

290
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,910
defends personal liberties but because

291
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,430
radical Islamism represented a direct

292
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,950
threat to his power on the other hand

293
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,420
Uzbekistan has a border with Afghanistan

294
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,340
and that's something that the United

295
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,410
States after Afghanistan's invasion

296
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,600
could really use in fact the Pentagon

297
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,910
installed an airbase in the south of the

298
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,190
country in exchange for you guessed it a

299
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,720
financial donation to kerim officer

300
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,420

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,830

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,050
by far have occurred in economic policy

350
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,970
the new government's has eliminated

351
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,370
capital controls and most price controls

ask the government for permission or pay

them a fee they've also announced lower

companies that invest in the country

360
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,130
this is basically opposite of what Matri

361
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,690
is done there's a president that should

362
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,160
take lessons from the president of

363
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,510

364
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,070
officials have traditionally been very

365
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,139

00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,620

372
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,010
the point is that these are all reasons

373
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,690
that the forecast for the country's

374
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,880
future have improved so much so that the

375
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,590
government can now issue debt in the

376
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,810
London market without investors fleeing

377
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,550
now does this mean that as becca stan

378
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,470
has being completely transformed

379
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,540
well no not at all is Becca Stan

380
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,580
although better now than with Kerimov

381
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,260
still has a repressive government

382
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,180
censorship still exists and free

383
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,370
elections are still not in sight and of

384
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,570
course the new president still has a

385
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,130
huge amount of control over everything

386
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,630
that happens in the country let's just

387
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,100
say that the process has kind of just

388
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,840
started but folks we're just gonna have

389
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,880
to wait and see how things play out with

390
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,770
time and we're gonna be watching very

391
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,810
closely because you can't say that it's

392
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,970
