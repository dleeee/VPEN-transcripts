00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,469
we've talked about Poland recently on

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,300
visual politic I'll leave a video link

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,370
in the description below to recap its

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,810
growth and development process in the

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,170
last decades have been vertiginous since

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,630
1992 the Polish economy has grown as an

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,550
average rate of over 4% per year

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,470
commencer other European nations Poland

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,760
has been one of the most prosperous

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,039
countries sitting just behind Ireland

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,050
Estonia and Latvia in fact even though

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,519
it may seem surprising given their

13
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,500
historical circumstances polls are

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,390
already within the European average in

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,140
terms of poverty risk

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,090
in other words Poland has been one of

17
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,100
the countries that has best managed to

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,410
digest the political economic and social

19
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,810
transitions that the former Soviet bloc

20
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,030
countries had to face after the USSR

21
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,520
collapsed but not everything that

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,110
glitters is gold

23
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,030
they have great statistics and economic

24
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,250
data that's no doubt about that in that

25
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,440
regard there undeniably successful

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
what's happening in the political and

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,690
social arena well that's exactly where

28
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,850
things get a bit murkier especially if

29
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,770
you care about such things as civil

30
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,750
liberties by now you probably realize

31
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,000
it's easier to change an economy than a

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,710
society societal change

33
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,670
it just takes much longer

34
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,100
as we'll see Poland along with Hungary

35
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,840
is probably the most conservative and

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,700
traditionalist country in the entire

37
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,710
European Union this might give you a bit

38
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,350
of an idea christianity is part of our

39
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,479
national identity the Catholic Church

40
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,300
was and is the preacher and holder of

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,180
the only commonly held system of values

42
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,640
in Poland outside of it we have only

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,420
nihilism

political party in the Polish Parliament

48
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,850
and it's not just a matter of religion

49
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,770
this country has also been characterized

50
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,020
by promoting a political agenda that for

51
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,030
many directly clashes with the EU's

52
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,440
principles do you want to know more

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,509
about what is happening in Poland's how

54
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:05,060
truly conservative its society is what's

55
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,680
the agenda that has become a real

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,940
headache for the European authorities

57
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,389
well listen up

58
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,270

60
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,280
basically if you're not Catholic white

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,660
and straight in Poland

62
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,040
you might get into trouble it's safe to

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,690
say that in one way or another you'll

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,000
feel outcast by a large part of society

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
and also by the government poland's

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,940
ruling party fuels anti-lgbt sentiment

67
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,340
ahead of elections polish election

leader of poland's law and justice party

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,170
targets gay rights as threat to society

70
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,180
in this country rejection of everything

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,160
beyond the traditional Christian family

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,990
model is very present within Polish

73
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,120
society for example in most European

74
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,710
countries the government's main party

75
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,140
calling LGBT people a threat to society

76
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,930
would be unthinkable however here it

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,400
happens every day

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,250
Poland's is just kind of like

79
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,760
[Music]

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,040
now how can a country like this which

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,140
somehow promotes the harassment of

82
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,120
minorities fit into a project like the

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,129
European Union and well that's the big

84
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,630
dilemma

85
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,150
because polish policy is sometimes

86
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,980
rather hard to understand on the one

87
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,140
hand polls continue to reelect a

88
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,150
nationalist anti-immigration and

89
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,250
homophobic party to leave the country

90
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,200
that is they choose leadership that is

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,880
against everything the European

92
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,130
Community project represents yes on the

93
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,870
other hand Polish society has the most

94
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,030
favorable impression of the European

95
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,140
Union check this out

[Music]

97
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,099
of course it's one thing to like the

98
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,989
European Union and a very different one

99
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,640
to be willing to comply with the

100
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
guidelines that emanate from Brussels

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,900
so check out how the polls are going

102
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,349
with that you top court Poland broke EU

103
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,380
law with judicial reform Poland Hungary

104
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,840
broke EU laws by refusing to host

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,660
migrants court adviser Poland defies

106
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,550
Brussels by vowing to stick to coal

107
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,709
poland plans to prioritize curbing its

108
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,569
reliance on Russian energy and so

109
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,489
continuing its dependence on coal over

110
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,890
signing up to the e u--'s net zero

111
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,750
emissions target and a move that is set

112
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,790
to put Warsaw on a collision course with

113
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,859
Brussels over climate policy the

114
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,750
European Union strives to make fair

115
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,580
rules for its member states and when it

116
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,590
comes to the crunch Poland goes rogue

117
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,540
but if they don't agree with you

118
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,550
recommendations how can it be that poles

119
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,560
have such a favorable opinion of the

120
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,910
European Union well we're going to

121
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,930
answer that question but we're gonna

122
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,820
take it step-by-step because believe me

123
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,010
it when I say that Polish politics is

124
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,040
well rather crazy

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,439
[Music]

126
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,569
it has been more than two years since

127
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,519
Brussels called Poland's out over its

128
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,129
alleged undemocratic drift so could

129
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,619
Poland's be turning towards

130
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,789
authoritarianism why is the first big

131
00:04:53,789 --> 00:05:01,110
question so let's take a look oh god

132
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,029
knows Oh Democrats yet

133
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:09,629
Oh what is never said polish democracy

134
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:10,840
in check

[Music]

136
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,660
it turns out this one thing that's much

137
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,700
more important than Poland's loyalty to

138
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,740
the European Union I'm talking about the

139
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,570
health of democracy the truth is that

140
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,520
today polish democracy isn't in a good

141
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,490
place and that's rather worry what has

142
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,500
been most aligning has been the Polish

143
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,690
government's increasingly personalist

144
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,520
shift for example there's been the

145
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,010
attempt of Yaroslav Kachinsky the pis

146
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,170
party leader to reduce the retirement

147
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,360
age of the Supreme Court judges from 70

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,940
to 65 which would mean kicking up 40% of

149
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,350
them out naturally they would need to be

150
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,630
replaced by other judges one likely to

151
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,470
be on good terms with the party

152
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,720
this situation became so serious that

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
the change was halted by the European

154
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,320
Court of Justice as they considered it

155
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,090
to be a clear attempt for political

156
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,710
control over the judiciary however

157
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,510
despite all of this the government has

158
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,370
continued to move in that same direction

159
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,570
in many ways for example in 2017 the

160
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,710
government got Parliament to approve

161
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,260
three very controversial laws this was

162
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,570
Kachinsky 's personal push to control

163
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,880
the country literally nothing and no one

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,650
was going to stand in his way

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,400
[Music]

166
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
basically the three laws not only

167
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,240
intended to grant legislators enormous

168
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
power over the judiciary's general

169
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,570
council but also gave the Justice

170
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,820
Minister himself who by the way is also

171
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,470
the Attorney General the right to

172
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,810
appoint local court judges and chiefs

173
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,430
you can imagine what this would mean in

174
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,139
terms of political control over the

175
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:41,950
courts

176
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,010

in an unexpected turn of events the

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,440
country's president Andrzej Duda who's

180
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
sympathetic towards the P is that

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
doesn't actually belong to the party

182
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,990
soon vetoed two of those three laws only

183
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,700
allowing the Minister of Justice to

184
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,970

disciplinary chamber for Polish judges

191
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,720
not independent says EC J's top advisor

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,280
so by this point many of you are

193
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,440
probably wondering what's the EU doing

194
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,570
about all of this well we can almost say

195
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,250
that the European community authorities

196
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,350
have launched a frontal attack on Poland

197
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,390
over all of these issues in fact for the

198
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,280
first time in history Brussels activated

199
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,510
the disciplinary action mechanism

200
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,610
against a member country something that

201
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,470
could end with suspending Poland's right

202
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,080
to vote in European decisions Poland

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
taken to --use top court over alleged

204
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,670
political control of judiciary and what

205
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,350
can I say they have every reason to do

206
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,120
so seeing politicians messing with the

207
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,430
justice system is very worrying however

208
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,290
the confrontations don't end with the

209
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,850
Polish government's attempt to assault

210
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,980
its own courts and end the separation of

211
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,700
powers

[Music]

213
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,700
if we also add in all of the current

214
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,500
ruling parties and a phobic ultra

215
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,660
Catholic and homophobic policies and we

216
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,820
find a country that directly contests

217
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,590
all of the actions that the European

218
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,570
Union has taken in recent years

219
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,970
Poland bashes immigrants but quietly

224
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,780
Poland as under siege from a quote

229
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,530
LGBT community to win basically the

230

political directions of the European

231
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,000
Union and Poland's are apples and

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,380
oranges and at this point you might be

233
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,780
thinking well Simon why then two poles

234
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,450
have such a good image of the European

235
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,190

237
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,370
Polish society don't dislike everything

that the European Union has to offer

239
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,910
in fact there's something they seem to

240
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,710
be quite fond of

criticizing the EU in Europe isn't

245
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,779
unusual that happens all over but here

246
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,060
is where polls take the cake complying

247
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,439
with community regulations regarding

248

political and judicial guarantees

to Poland in the distribution of

refugees within the community well

that's not happening

254

but money oh well money that's a whole

255
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:34,480
other thing they use money is of course

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,490
well received it's welcomed with open

arms and a huge smile and we're not

258
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,990
talking about small change here since

259
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,670
Poland joined the EU it has received

260
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,769
more than a hundred and ten billion

261
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:49,629
dollars in community aid the European

262
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:51,999
cohesion fund alone has awarded Poland

263
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,920
more than eighty five billion dollars

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,769
for the 2014 to 2020 period to finance

infrastructure projects such as highways

266
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,180
and railways

267
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,490
in fact Poland receives more funds from

268
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,740
the cohesion funds than any other new

269
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,660
country as a side note contrary to what

270
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,340
is usually claimed this type of aid

271
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,560
wasn't key in Poland's economic takeoff

272
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,430
not at all but it did help and this

273
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,470
promotes a question that has more and

274
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,750
more political EU leaders scratching

275
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,850
their heads should the EU community make

276
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,920
it a condition to provide financial aid

277
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,930
only to the countries that agree to

278
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,790
comply with the union's rules and

279
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,070
resolutions should Brussels frees funds

280
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,750
allocated to member states that have

281
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,520
anti-liberal plist governments that

282
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,290
don't fulfill their responsibilities

283
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,420
well it looks like it's going that way

284
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,870
brussels tells poland EU is quote not a

285
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,420
cow you can milk and in a way it makes

286
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,040
sense doesn't it the fact is that right

287
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,290
now the EU cohesion funds terms and

288
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,500
distribution for the 2021 to 2027 period

289
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,180
are being negotiated and it looks like

290
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,470
Poland won't do well Poland to get 23%

291
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,790
less EU 2020 to 20 27 plug it and if

292
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,220
this news is confirmed Poland could lose

293
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,690
almost a quarter of the money it

294
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,910
currently receives from the EU although

295
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,950
with just over 64 billion dollars it

296
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,750
would continue to be the largest fund

297
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,460
recipients but even this budget

298
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,010
reduction is not what it seems

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,210

with the punishment or anything like

302
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,360
that but with the fact that Poland's as

303
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,950
we told you at the beginning of the

304
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,110
video is a wealthier country today with

305
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,090
better infrastructure and it's closer to

306
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,100
the development average of the rest of

307
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,220
the European Union that's and the fact

308
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,780
that brexit has forced Brussels to

309
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,370
tighten its bells as it can no longer

310
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,200
count on the United Kingdom's annual

311
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,790
contribution to the community coffers

312
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,089
and while this is where we are

313
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,429
in any case this raises a question given

314
00:11:55,429 --> 00:11:57,739
polish society's political tendencies

315
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,779
and its enormous divergence from the

316
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,459
path brussels has set wouldn't

317
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,649
decreasing Poland's funds slowly push

318
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,629
this country further away from the Union

319
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,459
won't the Polish nationalist parties

320
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,679
just exploit these cuts as proof of

321
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,089

322
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,159
important question of all polish and
