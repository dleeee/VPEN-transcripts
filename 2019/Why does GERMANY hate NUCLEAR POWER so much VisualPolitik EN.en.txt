3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,290
nuclear power is like a hamburger yes

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,389
said you wouldn't have them anymore but

5
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,429
at the end of the day you just can't

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,310
resist the temptation the same goes for

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,260
nuclear power we all use it even though

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,630
it's a bit controversial

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,960
[Music]

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,210
if you've been following visual politic

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,790
for a long time you already know that

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,220
China has been building power plants

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,890
like there was no tomorrow well in

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,600
Europe we've actually got the opposite

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,390
trends going on and I know what you

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,350
might be thinking right now you're

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,090
probably thinking I mean come on Simon

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,800
everyone knows that France is the

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,440
biggest nuclear country yes well yes

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,510
you're absolutely right but even there

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,270
things starting to change inspectors

22
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,600
find safety irregularities at Chris Salt

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,880
nuclear forge in France in the United

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,649
Kingdom they wanted to build six plants

25
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,170
but in the end they only went one minute

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,479
early they held a referendum in 1990 to

27
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,280
stop nuclear forever and Spain might

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
close all seven of their nuclear

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
reactors as soon as they get old

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,380
this means they won't renovate them and

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,810
they won't build new ones so in ten

32
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,140
years

33
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,440
Spain might become a completely

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,030
non-nuclear country as well but this is

35
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,890
all rather small compared to Germany if

36
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,500
there's an anti-nuclear country its

37
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,970
Germany in three years they would have

38
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,590
closed all of their nuclear plants and

39
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,270
this is a big move in less than a decade

40
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,909
Germany will have closed 17 reactors

41
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,830
they used to rely a lot on nuclear power

42
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,840
but now essentially they're saying no

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,930
more and let's not forget that this

44
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,880
country is the biggest energy consumer

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,310
in all of Europe it has 80 million

46
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,439
citizens and plenty of factories indeed

47
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,659
it's the largest country in the largest

48
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,610
economy in Europe so the question is how

49
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,799
is Germany going to do away with nuclear

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,240
power I mean what are they going to use

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,729
to produce energy now and well who's

52
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,650
really benefiting from this anti-nuclear

53
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,320
policy most importantly is this really

54
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,970
good news in the fight against climate

55
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,310
change or not well today we're going to

56
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,019
answer all of these questions but before

57
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:13,209
we do let's take a look back at the

58
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:13,750
history

59
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,850
[Music]

60
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,800
Angela and her demons if nuclear power

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,180
is like hamburgers Japanese started

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,190
their diet in 2011 and you mind you

63
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,620
wondering well why I mean what was such

64
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,780
a big problem back then well let's

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,270
compare it to neighboring France France

66
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,240
has 58 reactors producing 75% of the

67
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,190
electricity in the country nevertheless

68
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,400
until 2011 Germany had just seventeen

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,650
reactors producing a little less than

70
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,170
20% of the country's total energy in

71
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,250
other words Germany didn't have any

72
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,990
reason to close its nuclear plants so

73
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,240
fast right why did it rush its

74
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,850
anti-nuclear agenda so much while the

75
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,750
answer lies in one word for Kashima

76
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,660
in the year 2011 a tsunami hits of

77
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,220
Japanese nuclear power plants the

78
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,290
Fukushima power plants this is how one

79
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,150
of the worst nuclear accidents started

80
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,040
and in all your thinking Japan might

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,540
have those kinds of problems because

82
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,580
they have earthquakes and tsunamis and

83
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,920
things like that but I mean Germany in

84
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,350
order to answer this question we have to

85
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,500
go back in time to the 1960s the 1960s

86
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,630
were the golden era for nuclear back

87
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,520
then Germany was divided into two

88
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,860
countries the capitalist West and the

89
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,810
communist East in the West

90
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,640
General Electric installed the first

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,010
plants soon German companies like

92
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,080
Siemens started specializing in nuclear

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,910
power and launching their own reactors

94
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,550
in the east by comparison the nuclear

95
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,980
plants were built by big state-owned

96
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,350
companies so yes the communist East

97
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,690
Germany was happy with nuclear power and

98
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,180
they had lots of reasons to be why well

99
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,550
they had their own uranium mines in fact

100
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,560
there was a time when eastern Germany

101
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,990
was the fourth largest uranium producer

102
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,910
meanwhile although the West had their

103
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,760
own minds they were too small most of

104
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,680
the uranium came from Canada and

105
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,019
Australia and this is how we come to

106
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,390
1986 what happens in this year well of

107
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,440
course that would be the year of the

108
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,030
Chernobyl accident

109
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,190
[Music]

110
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,890
this was the worst nuclear accident in

111
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,410
history way worse than Fukushima by then

112
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,930
Germany already had a big anti-nuclear

113
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,880
movements after years of protest they'd

114
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,020
already stopped some nuclear

115
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,300
construction projects and this is why

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,520
after Chernobyl anti-nuclear sentiment

117
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,740
grew in western Germany in fact one of

118
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,150
the conditions they required East

119
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,340
Germany to agree to for reunification

120
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,500
was the closure of all the nuclear power

121
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,210
plants for example at the time there was

122
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,890
a plant under construction in a city

123
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,390
called Stenzel they stopped construction

124
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,550
immediately and they haven't restored

125
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,470
the building since then basically after

126
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,050
Chernobyl nobody trusted Soviet security

127
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,480
at all but the story doesn't stop here

128
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
this German anti-nuclear movement became

129
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,560
a political party the greens' and watch

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,810
out because this party is very important

131
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,070
[Music]

132
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,050
they even had a coalition government

133
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,140
with the Social Democrats in the 1990s

134
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,000
do you member gerhard schrÃ¶der well we

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,410
talked about him in some previous videos

136
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,450
so before he was working for Gazprom

137
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,950
when he was the Chancellor of Germany he

138
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,590
was supported by the greens and this is

139
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,270
why one of his policies was the complete

140
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,550
shutdown of all nuclear power plants by

141
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,610
2021 nevertheless in 2010 with Angela

142
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,340
Merkel's governments they changed their

143
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,130
plans while Schroeder said he would shut

144
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,230
down all of the country's power plants

145
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,440
by 2021 Merkel postpones the shutdowns

146
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,970
for 15 more years until 2036 so well

147
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:48,170
what happened next well again Fukushima

148
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,670
despite the fact that the authorities

149
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,490
checked piece by piece all 17 reactors

150
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,530
and found no security issues the

151
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,450
public's minds it was already made up

152
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,220
this is why Merkel changed her plans

153
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,170
three months to close the oldest

154
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,600
reactors in a few more years to close

155
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,190
the rest but okay so is it only

156
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,990
Fukushima or was there something else

157
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,700
well of course there is something else

158
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,650
the real key word behind all of this is

159
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,080
not Fukushima but fear and it's not fear

160
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
of radioactivity but fear of the

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,300
elections during the 2009 elections the

162
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,740
two main political parties in Germany

163
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,480
the Social Democrats and the Christian

164
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,670
Democrats didn't even win 60% of the

165
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,530
votes Germans didn't trust the

166
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,910
mainstream parties anymore

167
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,010
that's who capitalized on this mistrust

168
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,020
in mainstream politics well of course

169
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,240
that was the Greens in fact everywhere

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,710
in Europe the Greens are getting more

171
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,330
and more votes if you don't believe me

172
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,940
just check the outcomes of the latest EU

173
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,820
elections in 2019 and yes one of the key

174
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,340
goals in the Greens manifesto is closing

175
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,470
nuclear power plants as soon as possible

176
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,270
so Merkel decided that the best she

177
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,190
could do in this situation was to close

178
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,470
the nuclear debate once and for all in

179
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,960
2022 Germany will have no more nuclear

180
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,630
power period with this strategy she

181
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,760
hopes to make the Greens less and less

182
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,740
relevance if they have nothing to fight

183
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,480
against there's no reason to vote for

184
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,340
them any more right than any might

185
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,070
wonder well has this strategy works well

186
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,420
not really

187
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,250
Germany's fragile coalition braced for

188
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,430
upset with greens and far-right set for

189
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,230
more games in fact anti-nuclear

190
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,270
sentiment is also big business for some

191
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,130
people don't believe me we'll keep

192
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,500
watching nuclear 9

193
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,960
danke imagine that one day you start and

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,030
no hamburger diet and so eventually you

195
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,530
just say well I guess if I can't eat

196
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,210
hamburgers I guess I'll just eat as much

197
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,370
ice cream as I want one month later you

198
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,110
eat five ice cream cones day and you

199
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,940
wonder why you're still gaining weight

200
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,610
so well this is what happens in Germany

201
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,340
just listen to this country I think we

202
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,370
can pioneer the green energy revolution

203
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,220
we can as a powerful industrial nation

204
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,190
achieve the transformation to efficient

205
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,820
renewable energy the so called energy

206
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,400
vendor policy started this was the

207
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,650
energy transition basically Germany

208
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,840
would bet on renewable energies while at

209
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,910
the same time reducing co2 emissions to

210
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,860
fight climate change in eight years the

211
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,810
change has been radical nuclear went

212
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,340
from generating 22 percent of the

213
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,170
country's power consumption to just 12

214
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,930
percent green energy has gone from 17 to

215
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,750
35 but hold on a second because there's

216
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,000
another side of the green energy story

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
the truth is with the technology we have

218
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,780
today it's very expensive to store

219
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,419
energy

220
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,600
[Music]

221
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,160
solar panels produce energy during the

222
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,200
day Windsor vines produce energy when

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,510
it's windy but what happens on a quiet

224
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,640
night where do you get your energy from

225
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,310
in those situations a good alternative

226
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,230
would be natural gas but if you've

227
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,030
watched previous videos on this channel

228
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,950
you already know the political problems

229
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,540
with that one we've devoted a whole

230
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,370
series of videos to talking about that

231
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,080
issue and will continue to talk about it

232
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,700
so subscribe if you want more of that

233
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,920
the natural gas is bad because it would

234
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,720
make Germany even more dependent on

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,390
natural gas so if we can't rely fully on

236
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,060
solar winds or gas well what else do we

237
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,640
have on the list well yeah we have the

238
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,850
least green option of all

239
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,820
around coal wins a reprieve in Germany's

240
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,800
transition to a green future in fact

241
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,630
brown coal is one of the biggest issues

242
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,570
with this energy vendor about brown coal

243
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,640
is a type of coal that pollutes a lot

244
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,440
then again Germany is the world's

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,840
biggest producer of this so yes thanks

246
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,760
to the energy vendor Germany has secured

247
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,070
20,000 jobs coal companies gonna be

248
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,050
happier what's the price of all of this

249
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,050
but of course it's co2 emissions Brown

250
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,450
coal causes more pollution than any

251
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,150
other kind of coal so on today's Germany

252
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,150
Brown coal accounts for 23% of total

253
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,590
energy consumed in reality though it's a

254
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,570
lot more factoring in the coal that

255
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,660
Germany imports gets you to about 35% so

256
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,850
in other words if Germany's goal was to

257
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,010
increase climate change then well

258
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,310
congratulations Germany you did it

259
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,940
[Music]

260
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,830
Germany admits 2020 greenhouse gas

261
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,350
emissions target Fukushima and the Paris

262
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,090
agreement happens in a very similar

263
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,010
timeframe and Germany is showing the

264
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,110
world that if you're an industrialized

265
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,080
country you cannot close coal plants and

266
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,750
nuclear plants at the same time you need

267
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,300
to keep at least one of the two open and

268
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,190
if you thought the energy drama stops

269
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,140
there well you'd better think again as

270
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,000
we said in previous videos nuclear

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,890
plants are expensive to build but once

272
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,630
you have them it's very cheap to produce

273
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,240
energy using them so closing nuclear

274
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,010
plants means that the energy bill is

275
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,710
going to be wildly expensive after this

276
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,450
the fact that green energies are far

277
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,670
from cheap and you will get news like

278
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,210
this

279
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,620
[Music]

280
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,330
Germany's economic backbone suffers from

281
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,090
soaring power prices so now the question

282
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,100
goes to you do you think Germany will

283
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,140
keep their energy transformation even if

284
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,510
it means lower competitiveness for their

285
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,190
companies and what do you think is more

286
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,650
important climate change or anti-nuclear

287
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,360
sentiments and what would you have done

288
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,130
if you were in the German governments

289
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,050
would you close the coal plants or the

290
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,790
nuclear ones well please leave your
