00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,920
this man you see on the screen is Lee

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,700
kun-hee

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,040
and he is the first human being to be

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,540
dead and alive at the same time yes you

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,340
could say he's something like

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,439
Schrodinger's cats but in real life by

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,170
the time we make this video Lee kun-hee

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,869
will spend more than four years hidden

10
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,420
in a South Korean hospital and nobody

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,190
dares to reveal his condition

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,250
and you might be wondering or why who is

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,160
this man what we're talking about the

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,290
president of Samsung one of the

15
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,270
wealthiest men on the planet

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,150
the day he dies his son will inherit

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,090
between ten and fifteen billion dollars

18
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,760
and right after he will have to pay

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,180
sixty five percent of this fortune to

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,980
the South Korean government

21
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,870
and yes I know what you might be

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,790
thinking well what's the problem here

23
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,159
who wouldn't want to have 35% of 15

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,110
billion dollars well believe me at the

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,610
end of this video you'll totally

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,830
understand why his son is not happy

27
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,020
about this and it might even admit that

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,990
yes you don't really want to know if Lee

29
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,440
kun-hee is dead or alive so let's get

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,210
started

31
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,750
[Applause]

[Music]

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,510
money is that thing that Kanye West

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,400
tries to get rid of as soon as possible

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,990
don't believe me well check out this

36
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,050
news Kanye West and Kim Kardashian spend

37
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,900
nearly 1 million dollars on gold toilets

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,690
exactly a lot of people hate to have

39
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,940
money in the bank but a lot of people

40
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,190
love money and among those who love

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,590
money the most probably billionaires the

42
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,960
wealthiest people on planet earth yes

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,150
this is a very small group of people but

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,619
it's growing day by day

45
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:04,929
number of billionaires worldwide surged

46
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:09,610
to 2754 in 2017 this has an easy

47
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,099
explanation emerging countries all of a

48
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,780
sudden countries like China and Vietnam

49
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,340
are starting to have their own

50
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,769
billionaires and you might now wonder is

51
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:20,769
this good or bad news well it depends on

52
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,540
who you ask for example according to

53
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,610
Gabriel Sherman a Marxist economist this

54
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,260
is a hell of a problem and I me make a

55
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,940
quick aside here you often hear about

56
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,040
some sort of conspiracy theory claiming

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,660
that the mainstream media tries to

58
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,519
silence all of the critics of capitalism

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,280
well both gabriel zucman and thomas

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,530
piketty's are the new anti capitalist

61
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,690
rock stars and they've been on the cover

62
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,120
of bloomberg magazine and no they

63
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,950
weren't painted as the bad guys so just

64
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,510
remember that the next time your

65
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,129
smartass friend shares their mainstream

66
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,799
media conspiracy theories but let's get

67
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,540
back to our story shall we so what's the

68
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,190
problem with billionaires according to

69
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,200
Zachman well they're destroying social

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,180
mobility but what is social mobility

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,459
it's essentially the academic term for

72
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,560
the American Dream think about it it's

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,209
hard to go from rags to riches if you're

74
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,950
competing with a guy who was born rich

75
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,239
and went to the best universities

76
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,130
according to some economists wealth in

77
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,420
America is getting more and more

78
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,700
concentrated in the hands of a small and

79
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,300
elite group

80
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,340
are they right or not it's hard to tell

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
because there's not really an effective

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,630
way to measure social mobility there are

83
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,910
indeed arguments on both sides but the

84
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,250
truth is sermons arguments are becoming

85
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,530
more and more influential so today's

86
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,050
question is should we tax wealthy people

87
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,570
more are there countries that already do

88
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,120
that does it work and what does the dead

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,430
and alive Samsung presidents have to do

90
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,020
with any of this well today we're going

91
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,550
to answer all of those questions but

92
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,710
before we do let's take a look back at

93
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,500
the history each the rich

94
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,510
nobody likes a tax hike but unless

95
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,100
you're Larry Ellison and you're watching

96
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,260
this video in which K is Hi Larry you

97
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,820
probably don't get nervous at the

98
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,680
mention of a special tax for

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,960
billionaires so you might wonder well

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,730
what do billionaires think about paying

101
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,980
more taxes you might be surprised

102
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,600
Warren Buffett and Bill Gates agree that

103
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,449
the rich should pay higher taxes yes you

104
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:20,859
heard that right but hold on a minute

105
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,300
because this proposal of taxing

106
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,340
billionaires is a bit more complicated

107
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,870
than it seems they don't just want a

108
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,120
higher income tax we're talking about a

109
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,910
wealth tax and this is very important

110
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,919
because wealth is one thing and income

111
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,360
is quite another and pay attention

112
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,669
because this is the key to understanding

113
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,800
the rest of this video let's see Eric's

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,810
explanation let's use Bill Gates as an

115
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,639
example he has a net worth of around one

116
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,320
hundred and three billion dollars

117
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,449
[Music]

118
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,129
but make no mistake he doesn't have it

119
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:52,199
in cash if we could sneak into his bank

120
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,179
account we wouldn't see anywhere close

121
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:56,279
to that kind of money so where is all of

122
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,039
his net worth well the answer is in

123
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,009
assets viable things such as houses and

124
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,869
you know maybe artwork but of course

125
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,749
lots of Microsoft shares and this means

126
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,329
that if Microsoft shares suddenly lost a

127
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:11,549
lot of their value Gates's wealth would

128
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:14,009
decrease substantially and this is why

129
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,779
any talking you hear that a person's net

130
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,329
worth is this soar is that it's just an

131
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,489
estimation in fact it's really hard to

132
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,439
measure somebody's wealth and this is

133
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,689
why proposals like this generate so much

134
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,580
debate

135
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,230
[Music]

136
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,310
I have a plan senator Elizabeth Warren

137
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,530
discusses proposed wealth tax and more

138
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,110
in Cedar Rapids so right now rich people

139
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,940
in America pay taxes just like anybody

140
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,830
else whenever they get in gum and

141
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,720
whenever they spend it they are taxed

142
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,730
but with this would be wealth tax they

143
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,080
would have to pay two to three percent

144
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,540
of their net worth every year even if

145
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,280
they didn't touch their money that year

146
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,840
they would have to pay it and we're not

147
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,120
just talking about cash but all kinds of

148
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,160
assets that would have to be valued by

149
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,380
some expert so far there are already

150
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,630
four countries that have similar taxes

151
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,360
Switzerland Belgium Norway and Spain

152
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,460
we're gonna talk about those cases in

153
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,740
another video but the truth is there is

154
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,720
a better formula for taxing the rich and

155
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,380
that's with an inheritance tax

156
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,660
an inheritance taxes the amounts we

157
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,550
would have to pay any time we inherited

158
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,740
money and it really has a similar effect

159
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,560
to the wealth tax it's just that instead

160
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,970
of paying a percentage of your net worth

161
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,460
while you're alive you pay when you die

162
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,590
many countries and American states have

163
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,690
this kind of tax system and yes these

164
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,330
taxes pose a large ethical debate many

165
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,470
of you might think that it's good

166
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,840
because it's unfair to be born rich but

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,030
many might think that it's even more

168
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,830
unfair to end up paying more than half

169
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,210
of the wealth you've created to the

170
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,250
government in many cases if we combined

171
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,690
all of the taxes you paid while you're

172
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,180
alive plus what you pay when you die you

173
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,950
might end up keeping just a very small

174
00:06:52,950 --> 00:07:00,090
share of what you made but again this is

175
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,460
a debate for another video what we want

176
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,990
to tell you about today is what happens

177
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,360
in the most extreme cases of inheritance

178
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,340
tax well where does this take place

179
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,919
well it's in South Korea pay attention

180
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,930
because this is where our good friends

181
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,630
Lee kun-hee president of Samsung comes

182
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,799
back into the picture

183
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:23,539
the secret of eternal life South Korea

184
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,159
is one of the most prosperous countries

185
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:26,959
on the planet and this means they have a

186
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,789
lot of very rich people however South

187
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,309
Korean wealth is different from American

188
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,529
wealth in South Korea 74 percent of

189
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,209
billionaires have inherited their

190
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,619
fortune if you've been subscribed to

191
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,299
visual politic for a long time you

192
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:39,619
already know that the South Korean

193
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:42,019
economy is based on these so called Chi

194
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,579
balls and by the way if you are

195
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,409
subscribed to visual politic well now

196
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,449
would be an excellent time to do that

197
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:50,539
click below companies like Samsung LG I

198
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,610
owned I became the beer moths that they

199
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,589
are today because of their connections

200
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,490
with the government

201
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,470
and these car balls they all have

202
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,630
something in common they are all family

203
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,150
owned companies for example Samsung was

204
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,490
founded by this man here who's name is

205
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,590
keep young-cheol when he died his son

206
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,360
inherited the company and the fortune

207
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,819
his son is our friends Lee kun-hee and

208
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,740
the day he dies his son whose name is

209
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,930
Lee jae-yong will inherit the business

210
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,580
in fact while the father is dead and

211
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,949
alive at the same time he's actually the

212
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:23,360
one who's in charge of the company

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,190
in other words Korea is not a country

214
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,050
where you start from zero like the

215
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,820
companies out of Silicon Valley

216
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,070
this is why South Korea has the

217
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,780
second-highest inheritance tax of any

218
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,660
country surpassed only by Japan in South

219
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Korea you could end up paying 65% of the

220
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,220
wealth you inherit yes you heard that

221
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,400
right you can end up with only 35% of

222
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,500
your inheritance I know you think me

223
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,480
well 35 percent of a fortune is still a

224
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,640
fortune in the case of Samsung this

225
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,620
inheritance could be 15 billion dollars

226
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,320
so it's not gonna be a bad payday right

227
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,520
well the problem is we're not just

228
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,590
talking about money here but also assets

229
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,420
and this is why having a billionaire dad

230
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,390
in South Korea can be a bit of a problem

231
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,050
[Music]

232
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,670
Korean businesses are terrified with the

233
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,680
punitive Lehigh inheritance tax rate

234
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,480
which is among the highest in the world

235
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,060
think about it this 15 billion is not

236
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,160
cash mainly this fortune comes from

237
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,590
shares of Samsung but those 7 billion

238
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,000
dollars that he could end up paying

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,820
they'll have to be paid in cash in other

240
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,590
words he would have to sell his father's

241
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,270
shares of the company as an ie might be

242
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,860
wondering well how many shares really

243
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,750
after sell well that depends on two

244
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,410
factors

245
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,060
the start price at the time the father

246
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,980
dies and the stock price at the time he

247
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,050
wants to sell it and well in this case

248
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,730
the Samsung family could not be more

249
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,740
unlucky

250
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,380
uber of Samsung Group Chairman Lee

251
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,990
kun-hee's death raises stock prices

252
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,120
whether we're talking about LG Hyundai

253
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,160
or Korean air all of their owners face

254
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,260
the same problem but Samsung's situation

255
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,150
is the most incredible of all in this

256
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,130
case samsung stocks won't stop growing

257
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,780
this means that the son is going to

258
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,700
inherit more and more wealth but that's

259
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,650
not the end of the story because if all

260
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,330
of a sudden he has to sell a large

261
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,310
amount of its stock well what's going to

262
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,110
happen to the market price is going to

263
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,060
immediately drop this means the poor lee

264
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,980
jae-yong can find himself in the

265
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,990
situation of having a really small share

266
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,120
of his inheritance this means no money

267
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,770
and no rights over the family business

268
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,110
and this explains why he's willing to do

269
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,290
anything to keep his father alive

270
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,070

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,750
chairman Lee kun-hee entered Samsung

273

Medical Center following a heart attack

274
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,649
the country's largest business group is

maintaining a veil of secrecy over its

276
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,550
leaders health and the future of its

277
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,320
management in the meantime the song is

278
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,490
trying to make a deal with the South

279
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,930
Korean government in order to pay the

280
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,029
inheritance tax little by little but

281
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:50,949
this won't be easy his relationship with

282
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,899
the new presidents moon jae-in couldn't

283
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:53,590
be worse

Samsung error sentenced to five years in

286
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,860
jail after corruption conviction yeah

287
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,360
Samsung was involved in a corruption

288
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,250
scandal because they bribed the previous

289
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,500
president he was from the opposing party

290
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,120
and day by day we're learning of how

291
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,770
this corruption scandal was worse than

292
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,460
we thought

293
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,260
you'll have to go back to court and he

294
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,240
might lose all of the penalty reductions

295
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,280
that he had and in the meantime Samsung

296
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,620
stock prices just keep on growing

297
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,410
since 2016 they have doubled their value

298
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,940
so it seems the only solution for our

299
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,980
friends new jae-young might be to head

300
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,080
onto the streets of Seoul and shout at

301
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,510
people to stop buying Samsung stock

302
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,040
meanwhile the Samsung patriarch has

303
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,620
found the secret to eternal life since a

304
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,150
heart attack sent him to the hospital in

305
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,400
2014 nobody outside of the family has

306
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,410
seen him and he continues to be the

307
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,260
company's president at least on paper

308
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,180
[Applause]

309
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,010
tonight might be wondering does this

310
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,870
inheritance tax really work is South

311
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,330
Korea a paradise of income equality and

312
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,910
the truth is not really you see despite

313
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,530
the fact that we can't measure social

314
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,200
mobility we can measure equality how

315
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,510
well that's with the Gini index here we

316
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,130
can see how South Korea is not

317
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,230
especially unequal but not especially

318
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,360
equal either Germany the UK even the

319
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,700
Czech Republic a far more equal but of

320
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,190
course that's a video for another day

321
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,510
now the question goes over to you would

322
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,950
you vote in favor of a higher

323
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,320
inheritance tax like that of South Korea

324
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
will you vote in favor of a wealth tax

325
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
like the one proposed by Elizabeth

326
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,420
Warren and what do you think will happen

327
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,670
to Samsung's presidents but please leave
