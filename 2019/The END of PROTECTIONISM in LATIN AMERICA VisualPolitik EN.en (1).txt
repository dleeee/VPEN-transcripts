on friday 28th of June 2019 it was

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:12,840
announced that the European Commission

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,849
had reached an agreement with Mercosur

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,470
to create the largest free trade

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,660
agreement in its history and folks the

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,250
euphoria felt on the other side of the

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,649
taken 20 long years to reach an

14
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,360
agreement that affects a population of

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,789
almost 800 million people in the quarter

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,239
of the world's GDP the agreement reached

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,309
will launch a free trade agreements of

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,680
the so-called new generation which means

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,780
it will deal both with the commerce and

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,550
several other issues related to public

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,469
regulations however having reached an

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,300
agreement does not mean that everything

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,640
is solved actually troubles have only

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,710
just started for example last September

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,750
the 19th the Austrian Parliament voted

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,909
against this deal forcing the Austrian

27
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,830
government to veto it at the European

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,290
Council Austria could indeed be just the

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,150
first out of a bunch of countries that

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,830
may oppose the agreement if it was

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,509
negotiated why does the Austrian

32
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,189
Parliament want to veto this what are

33
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,049
the advantages and the risks of this

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,460
free trade agreement between the

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,409
European Union and Mercosur and how

36
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,049
would this deal impacts Latin America so

37
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,909
dear viewers we're going to answer these

38
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,460
questions but first well we need to know

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,439
exactly what Merck's or is in the role

40
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,509
it's played since it was founded and

41
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,000
indeed has Marisol been a success or a

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,720
bit of a failed experiment

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,729
the Latin American history of regional

47
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,460
integration processes is as long as it

48
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,070
is erratic we have to go a long way back

49
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,260
in time at least to the 1950s to find

50
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,150
the first of Latin America's attempts to

51
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,520
unite economically and commercially in

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,050
other words to create something similar

53
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,450
to a common market in which they can buy

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,060
sell invest or move without national

55
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,800
borders being an obstacle then I can

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,080
tell you that 60 years later it still

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,570
has the same debates and the same

58
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,220
objectives so you could imagine

59
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,410
something and that's that things didn't

60
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,510
really go according to plan

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,340
[Music]

62
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,930
the Montevideo treaty was signed in

63
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,880
February of 1960 creating the a

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,530
latin-american free trade association

65
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,060
its most ambitious bet it was made up of

66
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,220
the ten South American Republic's and

67
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,590
Mexico and had a very clear mission to

68
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,660
eliminate all tariffs and most regional

69
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,580
trade obstacles within a maximum period

70
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,630
of ten years

71
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,340
unfortunately that goal was never

72
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,110
reached

73
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,120
however folks what a Latin America's

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,100
economic integration process progressed

75
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,470
slower than an arthritic turtle the rest

00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,190
of the world

77
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,330
it didn't standstill during the 70s 80s

78
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,670
and 90s the European integration project

79
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,010
continued to grow the foundations of the

80
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,870
future NAFTA the free trade agreement

81
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,580
between Canada the United States and

82
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,350
Mexico were set in place during the late

83
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,780
1980s for a president accused of not

84
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,000
getting out two big artillery in support

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,530
of the North American trade agreement

86
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,150
how about this down the hall to the

87
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,190
White House East Room he came was three

88
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,940
of his predecessors in Coe and in that

89
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,220
same period Asian countries decided to

90
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,100
take the market by the throat in general

91
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,410
during the 70s 80s and 90s the entire

92
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,750
world took huge strides towards the idea

93
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,520
of boosting international trade

94
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,740
something later known as globalization

95
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,110
even the so-called Uruguay rounds kicked

96
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,480
off in 1986 which would end up paving

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,280
the way for the World Trade Organization

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,930
yes it may have been that international

99
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,160
frenzy along with a latin-american

100
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,830
economic crises that finally encouraged

101
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,240
the governments of Brazil Argentina

102
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,550
Uruguay and Paraguay to signed the

103
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,900
Treaty of Accession

104
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,230
on March 4 26 1991 the treaty that

105
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,780
established the southern common market

106
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,360
Marcus or Canseco America loca moon

107

Organo superior encargado de la

108
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,270
conducción política but just a minor

109
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,130
because it's all very well to have great

110
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,440
intentions but getting results is a

111
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,989
different matter almost three decades

112
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,330
later despite its name the southern

113
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,340
common market murca saw hasn't managed

114
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,710
to become a common market and that's not

115
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,290
even its worst problem nor its only one

116
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,980
so listen up he disowned the proper

117
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,840
courtship on periscope and I'm a entire

118
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,050
domain pusher Mercosur the wannabe let's

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,610
do an exercise look at the information

120
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,230
and what are we finds well on paper maca

121
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,250
saw is a huge economic zone we're

122
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,600
talking about an organization that

123
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,850
effects almost 13 million square

124
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,350
kilometers almost 300 million

125
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,450
inhabitants in more than three-quarters

126
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,970
of all South America's GDP that's almost

127
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,010
three trillion dollars as you can see

128
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,840
Marcos law had all the elements for

129
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,490
becoming one of the largest markets on

130
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,350
the planet however over time if they've

131
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,910
proven anything it's been their

132
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,180
limitations

133
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,310
and this has a lot to do with the

134
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,990
spirits in which the economic

135
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,850
integration movements in Latin America

136
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,620
were born allow me to explain since the

137
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,240
very first plans were put on the table

138
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,860
they were based on what has been known

139
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,990
as closed regionalism that is

140
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,850
eliminating trade tariffs or countries

141
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,620
within the block while maintaining and

142
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,630
even increasing tariffs towards the rest

143
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,560
of the world in the case of Marcos all

144
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,150
this was done through the so called

145
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,430
common external tariff a common tariffs

146
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,380
applied to imports originating outside

147
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,780
Mercosur with its they intended to favor

148
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,120
intra-regional trade by making imports

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
from outside the bloc more expensive

150
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,680
through high tariffs of 15 20 or even 30

151
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,210
percent

152
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,340
of course that obviously had

153
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,180
consequences

154
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,250
let me explain yes that barrier might

155
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,810
help some local producers such as

156
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,539
Argentine wheat producers but in general

157
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,160
all those restrictions they stopped

158
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,050
international investment made buying

159
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,970
technology much more expensive and

160
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,500
prevented Marcos or countries from

161
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,039
joining international production chains

162
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:13,139
and although many politicians don't

163
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,270
realize this that's how the world works

164
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,820
each part of a products is simply made

165
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,710
in a different place therefore if you

166
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,389
prevent or punish the arrival of

167
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,070
supplies that manufacturers need with

168
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,169
tariffs then well you get left out but

169
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,910
it doesn't in there in the end of course

170
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,250
if you defends protectionism against the

171
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,780
rest of the world's what's to stop you

172
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,250
doing it to your own neighbors and

173
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,840
that's precisely what happens with

174
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,490
Marcos or they have been unable to

175
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,530
create a true common market because in

176
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,270
the end neither the various governments

177
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,490
of Brazil nor the different Argentine

178
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,930
governments have ever believed in

179
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,940
international trade as a tool to grow

180
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,560
this has caused a situation in which

181
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,389
unlike the European Union customs

182
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,070
between the Mercs or member countries

183
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,639
themselves have not disappeared

184
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,380
Argentina and Uruguay are members of

185
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,840
Mercosur in theory internal borders

186
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,940
should not exist in America sewers and

187
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,550
practice customs sanitation inspections

188
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,680
and other paperwork mean that the trucks

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,479
are delayed for up to 24 hours

190
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,880
Oscar terzaghi to the economist once

191
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,740
another example well here's a question

192
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,870
let me see if you get it right China is

193
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,820
the country to which Argentina applies

194
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,039
these strictest anti-dumping measures as

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,169
a way to hinder imports any guess the

196
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,909
second country to which Argentina

197
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,039
applies the most anti-dumping measures 3

198
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,080
to 1 well you might be surprised that

199
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,320
the answer is none other than Brazil yes

200
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,970
you heard that correctly with friends

201
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,449
like these who needs enemies the fact is

202
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,280
that trade doesn't depend on tariffs

203
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,560
alone not at all in fact Latin America

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,449
in general has very few regional trade

205
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,639
tariffs but well trade restrictions they

206
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,990
can go much further than that

207
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,880
anti-dumping rights automatically

208
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,380
demanding and not granting import

209
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,479
licenses exchange rate interventions

210
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,850
rules of origin etc etc

211
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,540
[Music]

212
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,220
at the end of the day governments have a

213
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,140
lot of room to maneuver when there isn't

214
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,270
a real common market in the ends between

215
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,770
one thing in another the political

216
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,420
leaders of murka saw have managed to

217
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,370
make this one of the least integrated

218
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,220
commercial areas on the planet you have

219
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,870
to look hard to find another trade

220
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,820
agreement with as little intro zone

221
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,160
growth as médicos or D'Adamo Tolosa

222
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,290
executive director of the Uruguayan

223
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,240
think-tank Center for Economic and

224
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,820
Social Policy Research more than an

225
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,130
internal free trade area macro sewer is

226
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,830
a free domestic protectionism area

227
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,240
Argentina has applied as many

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,890
protectionist measures as it could

229
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,660
against the other members in Brazil

230
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,950
didn't help much either

231
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,100
Roberto Chi civil

232
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,380
in fact check out our Argentina's

233
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,389
exports to Brazil have evolved over

234
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,210
recent years

235
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:58,330
[Music]

236
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,650
however folks all this seems to be

237
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,540
finally changing and that's exactly

238
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,800
where the agreement with the European

239
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,560
Union comes in column of India news

240
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,050
pero laura mercier momento tiempo para

241
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,270
encontrar most mucho leaders complain

242
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,430
about that pattern for money to never

243
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:19,400
lead us towards a numerical sewer makisu

244
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,770
was born lame beyond the great political

245
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,660
speeches the truth is that it never

246
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,920
really had much hope of achieving

247
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,330
widespread integration but despite

248
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,070
everything the first years they weren't

249
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,200
that not at all in fact the volume of

250
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,570
trade between Marcus or countries x 3

251
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,960
from 8% of all trade in 1991 to 25% in

252
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,510
1998 everything indicated that despite

253
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,220
their limitations things could go

254
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,540
reasonably well however after the year

255
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,670
2000 everything got rather complicated

256
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,500
the new Latin American political leaders

257
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,580
and nestor kirchner

258
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,830
lula da silva and de barra Vasquez

259
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,810
changed Murchison's economic idea

260
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,220
fundamentally turning it into a

261
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,990
political body they even created a

262
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,410
parliament at the max or Parliament

263
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,370
basically at this time of closed

264
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,140
regionalism they moved on to what

265
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,180
leftist theorists themselves have called

266
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,520
post hegemonic regionalism what isn't

267
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,590
very clear is what this means it was

268
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,630
precisely at this time that Argentina

269
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,970
Brazil and Uruguay welcomed Venezuela

270
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,130
into Mercs all through Hugo Chavez and

271
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,930
began the process of integrating Bolivia

272
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,730
although it is true that Venezuela was

273
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,080
indefinitely suspended in 2017 the

274
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,000
problem with all this is that time when

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,590
murca saw hasn't yet achieved economic

276
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,110
integration well the economy was hit so

277
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,850
hard that an organization called

278
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,070
southern market became almost everything

279
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:45,260
except an integrated market

280
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,120
that's how the 25% of trade wait between

281
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,820
Murchison members in 1998 fell to just

282
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,550
over 13 percent in 2017 to give you a

283
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,650
better idea in the European Union this

284
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:02,660
number amounts to 64% five times more

285
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,730
but now with the arrival of new leaders

286
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,890
like Boston ro and Macri the bloc's

287
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,080
seemed to have changed course the first

288
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,700
great achievement of this new strategy

289
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,440
has been the agreement with the European

290
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,660
Union by signing one of the largest free

291
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,070
trade agreements ever we're talking

292
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,600
about the involvement of 32 countries

293
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,300
almost 800 million people and 19

294
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,910
trillion dollars of GDP and folks this

295
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,740
opens the region up to huge

296
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,900
opportunities especially if Marcus or

297
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:34,210
countries

298
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,090
a historical opportunity

299
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,350
[Music]

300
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,270
we still don't know all the details nor

301
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,589
whether the agreements will be

302
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:44,779
immediately applied but once already on

303
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,870
the table sounds very very good see

304
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,490
according to the agreement reached the

305
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,230
European Union will eliminate tariffs

306
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,720
for 92% of Murchison's exports and he'll

307
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,370
also grant access to preferential

308
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,740
conditions to an extra 7.5 percent this

309
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,510
means that less than 1% of the products

310
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,370
that murca sauce sells to the European

311
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,470
Union will be left out of the agreements

312
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,420
meant obviously this will greatly boost

313
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,459
the competitiveness of South American

314
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:11,089
companies and watch out because the

315
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,399
European Union is a commercial Colossus

316
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,470
that devours products from all over the

317
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,550
world you is a huge market with 500

318
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,620
million inhabitants that represents 20%

319
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,700
of the world economy

320
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,470
it's the biggest investor with a stock

321
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,060
that exceeds 30 percent of global

322
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,220
investments and imports 17 percent of

323
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,140
all the world's purchases of goods and

324
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,760
services from an Argentine government

325
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,530
report

326
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,750
each year the European Union spends more

327
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,610
than two billion dollars on all kinds of

328
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,320
products from the rest of the world well

329
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,090
of this entire amount a little more than

330
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,620
two percent comes from the South

331
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,270
American block each year the European

332
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,850
Union imports more from South Korea than

333
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,920
from all of the Mercosur countries put

334
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,850
together however now this agreement

335
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,830
gives Brazil Argentina Uruguay and

336
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,960
Paraguay the chance to get a bigger and

337
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,740
bigger slice of the pie think about what

338
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,630
this means for example for agriculture

339
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,370
the sector that exports the most Europe

340
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,840
with this Agreement ninety nine percent

341
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,430
of its exports to the EU will be

342
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,260
liberalized and even more than 80

343
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,210
percent will be free of any tariff and

344
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,500
don't forget the Europe imports more

345
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,120
than a hundred and twenty billion

346
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,640
dollars in agri-food products every year

347
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,830
we're talking about huge business here

348
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,570
on the other hands ninety-one percent of

349
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,430
European Union exports to Mercker saw

350
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,710
will also be duty-free this means that

351
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,510
for example Brazilian Argentine

352
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,910
Uruguayan and Paragon companies will be

353
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,770
able to access German technology and

354
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,600
machines with greater ease and better

355
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,510
terms of course the agreement won't be

356
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,250
fully implemented for 15 years though

357
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,990
until then we'll see a progressive

358
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,000
application with the idea of giving the

359
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,130
South American countries x you implement

360
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,780
the reforms that they need in order to

361
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,850
be able to compete this is especially

362
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,120
critical in Argentina's case

363
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
[Music]

364
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,700
that's why the bulk of European exports

365
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,410
will be completely liberalized within 10

366
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,480
to 15 years that is Marcus or will

367
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,490
benefit from this agreement much earlier

368
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,360
than most European companies

369
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,330
[Applause]

370
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,490
[Music]

371
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,230
in fact once the agreement is enforced

372
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,510
76% of Murchison's exports will be

373
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,730
duty-free compared to only 13% of

374
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,010
European exports and Argentinian

375
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,080
politicians still complain it's pretty

376
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,040
incredible atado yo Sierra una cuerda

377
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,830
que cela moody physique mo fek la

378
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,960
condición el trabajo in Argentina

379
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,700
of course there's very important point

380
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,410
that we should stress here a free trade

381
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,390
agreements is an opportunity but it's

382
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,640
also a risk if countries decide not to

383
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,860
compete free-trade demands competition

384
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,570
there are no excuses because the

385
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,520
agreement will also establish its own

386
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,710
methodology that is as long as the

387
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,450
agreement is enforced governments cannot

388
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,430
boycott trading with foreign companies

389
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,350
or at least they'll be much more limited

390
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,910
in doing so and everything doesn't end

391
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,560
with the EU now Marisol wants to make

392
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,270
similar agreements with Korea Singapore

393
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,310
Canada after countries and even the

394
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,080
United States and of course doing what

395
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,070
they should have done in the first place

396
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,840
also improves the economic integration

397
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,570
of their own member countries so will we

398
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,640
soon see a true common South American

399
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,950
markets and is Marisol finally taking

400
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,080
off and the most important question will

401
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,270
this agreement between Murchison's the

402
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,520
European Union be able to make Austria

403
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,010
and other hesitant EU member states come

404
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,140
