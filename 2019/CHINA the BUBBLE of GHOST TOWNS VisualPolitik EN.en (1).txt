3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,530
in a world that is facing unprecedented

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,110
increases in population ends with larger

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,910
and larger cities you could wonder two

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,800
cities have limits well the truth is

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,130
well yes that's why in some countries

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,080
they're opting for a much more drastic

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,430
solution than normal

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,439
I'm referring to the so called cities

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,869
from scratch but what exactly are cities

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,279
from scratch well with cities from

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,809
scratch we're talking about cities that

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,760
are created constructed and populated

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,320
where there used to be absolutely

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,629
nothing more than a vast expanse of land

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:42,270
or sea take for example Songdo in south

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,520
korea

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,410
Songdo which was also turned into a

20
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,000
special economic zone is one of the

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,129
world's greatest examples of what a city

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,500
built from scratch should be it's a true

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,430
example of success and while some of the

24
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,770
others they didn't go so well and some

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,690
they were a complete failure but let's

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,000
pause for a second some of you might be

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,949
thinking that this is a bit crazy I mean

28
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,049
isn't it too expensive to just build a

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,570
city from absolutely nothing well yeah

30
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,960
you're kinda lutely right

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,770
[Music]

32
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,810
China for example has used more concrete

33
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,670
in the last three years than the United

34
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,160
States did throughout the entire 20th

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,020
century but why are so many new cities

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,910
being built right now is it just about

37
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,950
offering more housing to the people

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,020
coming from the countryside or are there

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,600
more reasons behind it well let's take a

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,780
closer look

41
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,270
[Music]

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,620
the power of cities

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,760
[Music]

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,950
it is a fact that power is concentrated

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,470
in cities and I'm not only talking about

46
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,000
political power here I'm also talking

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,980
about economic power industrial power

48
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,500
artistic power cultural power cities are

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,750
something of a cocktail of elements that

50
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,570
leads to a prosperity explosion

51
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,069
[Music]

52
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,019
and it's precisely beneath all that

53
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,299
prosperity that we find the reasons to

54
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,459
create new cities cities from scratch

55
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,409
but you may be wondering where the hell

56
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,329
are all of these new cities being built

57
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,430
well let's see in Europe I can think of

58
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,900
very few examples that fits but in

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,670
America there are some but they're on a

60
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,090
much smaller scale so where can they be

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,109
any ideas

62
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,519
well yes you've probably got it Asia is

63
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,470
the greatest proponents of new cities in

64
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,810
the world and within Asia there's one

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,440
country that has taken us to the extreme

66
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,110
China has built more than 600 cities

67
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,840
from scratch since the Chinese Communist

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,300
Party came to power in 1949 and not all

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,310
of these cities were built with the same

70
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,770
function in mind for example some are

71
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,690
centers of state or regional political

72
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,400
power others are oriented towards

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,500
logistics others are technological many

74
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,300
others seek to be trade and Finance

75
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,070
centers and of course some artists

76
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,300
chiefly residential however the bottom

77
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,010
line is that the purpose of the city

78
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,900
doesn't really matter they're all built

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,360
with a common ambition to be engines of

80
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,570
long-term economic growth china plans to

81
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,300
build new city nearly three times the

82
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:28,290
size of New York

83
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,500
[Music]

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,030
yes we're talking about an extreme case

85
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,250
of urban planning but market targeted

86
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,810
planning which doesn't necessarily mean

87
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,820
that it'll go well but you know we're

88
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,500
gonna see more about that in a bit the

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,820
point here is that the relationship

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,620
between cities and economic development

91
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,480
isn't only being pursued by China but

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,310
also by other developing countries that

93
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,200
are experiencing a fast transfer of

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,850
people from the countryside to cities

95
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,770
and I can tell you that this is

96
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,120
something we're gonna be talking about

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,950
in the future on visual politic so you

98
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,450
know be sure to subscribe if you're into

99
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,160
that you see this isn't only happening

100
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,870
in Asia in Africa there are projects

101
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,000
such as the UK Atlantic in Nigeria hope

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,430
City in Ghana Konza in Kenya or the new

103
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,290
administrative capital yeah that's the

104
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,690
name in Egypt of course in order for

105
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,910
this to be a success we need to know how

106
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,650
to build a city from scratch and for

107
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,450
that we must take many important things

108
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,640
into account such as location or to

109
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
supply capital investment public

110
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,420
transport and waste management's among

111
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,340
many other things and let's not forget

112
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,410
to create a city identity within which

113
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,610
people feel comfortable and integrated

114
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,830
as you can imagine all this is very

115
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,780
expensive that's why not all the cities

116
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,000
have worked as planned even considering

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,220
all the risk new city fever is very

118
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,380
common in several developing countries

119
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,030
so before we go on we need to consider

120
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,250
something do all cities follow the same

121
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,170
model are they all driven in the same

122
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,450
way listen closely to the answer because

123
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,530
it might just surprise you

124
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,260
[Music]

125
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,880
the paradigm of public and private

126
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,210
cities

127
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,880
yes folks you heard that right private

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,949
cities as with everything there isn't

129
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,570
just one way of doing things and

130
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,520
therefore there isn't a single city

131
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,160
management model now is true most cities

132
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,080
are driven and managed by the public

133
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,940
sector that is by the state by

134
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,190
governments but folks a small number of

135
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,169
them have been created and managed by

136
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,479
the private sector and some are more

137
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:24,889
successful than others but let me ask

138
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,300
you a question now what do you think of

139
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,100
the main differences between these two

140
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,280
models when we talk about private cities

141
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,380
you may imagine a huge wall with

142
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,360
security guards at the doors controlling

143
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,550
who can or cannot pass thought perhaps

144
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,530
charging a fee for entry well nothing

145
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,849
could be further from the truth

146
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,919
private cities are ordinary cities whose

147
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,050
only peculiarity is that they have been

148
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,690
designed built and later managed by one

149
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,430
or more private companies that is

150
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,229
instead of receiving services from the

151
00:05:57,229 --> 00:05:58,639
public administration through the

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,710
municipality and taxes these services

153
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,240
are provided by private companies

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,310
through a kind of general service

155
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
contract that the residents sign when

156
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,490
they move in that is paid annually

157
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,199
perhaps one of the best examples of this

158
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,210
is arrest on

159
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,590
the rest on is a private city in

160
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,840
Virginia in the United States it belongs

161
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,390
to Fairfax County founders in the early

162
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,120
1960s it was conceived as a set of

163
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,670
company created owner communities and is

164
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,620
more or less continued this way to this

165
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,280
day these communities have their own

166
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,020
private security surface garbage

167
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,880
collection and public transport and it

168
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,740
looks like things have gone quite well

169
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,570
the city saw huge population growth

170
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,640
between 1970 and 1980 alone the

171
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,290
population skyrocketed from less than

172
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,220
6,000 to more than 36,000 which is a 536

173
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,900
percent increase in just 10 years

174
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,430
today more than 60,000 people live in

175
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,920
Reston and it makes sense Reston for

176
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,690
example there has been catalogued by a

177
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,460
CNN study as one of the best small

178
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,280

Lavar sir in India is a private city in

development that will have an area or a

184
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,210
hundred square kilometers and three

185
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,980
hundred thousand inhabitants when

186
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,630
completed today it's one of the best

187
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,280
places to live in India thanks to its

188
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,020
services in any event we'll need to see

189
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,640
if this way of making cities takes off

190
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,740
in the upcoming years because the truth

191
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,710
is most cities don't follow this private

192
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:36,220
model and folks let's not kid ourselves

193
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,290
a new city being public or private

194
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,630
doesn't define its success or failure

195
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,220
several factors come into play to make

196
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,350
cities as we want them to be troop hubs

197
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,810
of growth and prosperity and among them

198
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,030
the most important one is urban planning

199
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,680
with a vision of the future but also

200
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
remaining realistic and thinking about

201
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,790
the people well there is a country where

202
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,220
these basic concepts have gotten quite

203
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:07,030
out of hand so listen up becoming an

204
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,550
addict cities cities and more cities we

205
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,590
told you at the beginning China has a

206
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,590
clear idea in mind the future is in the

207
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,180
cities

208
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,039
[Music]

209
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,860
but to what extent when should a country

210
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,499
say stop we don't need any more cities

211
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,360
well folks the Chinese government

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,610
doesn't seem to want to see what the

213
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,409
rest of the world sees that they have a

214
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,909
bit of a problem they're going to need a

215
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,709
lot of people to and have it to their

216
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:38,240
mammoth cities that have been built from

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,909
scratch China's shrinking cities are

218
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,709
still addicted to building

219
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,350
despite population slump and of course

220
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,029
building a city with everyone else's

221
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,070
money leads to a huge illusion of

222
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,930
economic prosperity a lot of players

223
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,310
become involved in whole economic

224
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,560
sectors continue to work thanks to the

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,360
new cities construction for example

226
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,370
Chinese local governments have covered a

227
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,529
lot of their budget for years thanks to

228
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,329
real estate developments in these new

229
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:10,010
cities you see in the year 2000 land

230
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,899
sales accounted for 9.3 percent of

231
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,730
municipal revenues in China well

232
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,490
consider this in 2011 after more than 10

233
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,649
years of new city booms this amount

234
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,990
reached a whopping seventy four point

235
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,880
one percent of total revenues basically

236
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,010
they thought that founds the goose that

237
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,110
laid the golden eggs according to a

238
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,149
joint study done by land si Renmin

239
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,339
University and Michigan State University

240
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,100
Chinese municipalities and 40 times more

241
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,690
money selling lands for urban

242
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,220
development than they had to pay to

243
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,870
expropriate them and in the case of

244
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,000
lands reclaimed from the sea this ratio

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,860
could increase up to a hundred times

246
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,230
more with these numbers it doesn't seem

247
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,029
like bad business right

248
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,620
however just told on for a second before

249
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,779
we start ringing the bells of

250
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,610
celebration on the one hand local

251
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,230
governments spent all that money and

252
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,269
much more building infrastructure and

253
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,160
projects of all kinds but after rule

254
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,899
that seems like the money was always

255
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,490
it's going to just fall from the sky and

256
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,410
when the apartments were full of people

257
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:13,230
they'd get more and more money

258
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,550
there was such euphoria that several

259
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,279
local governments even ended up becoming

260
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,720
developers which led them to accumulate

261
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,910
a huge amount of debt but of course this

262
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,220
model is enormous Lee short-sighted and

263
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,079
is quickly losing ground in China I mean

264
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,420
if you extend the process to Marshall

265
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,279
ends up with dozens of completely empty

266
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,380
cities full of abandons or half built

267
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,180
residential blocks because nobody is

268
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,529
living in them and forget about new

269
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,480
taxes and all that of course the debt it

270
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,649
won't disappear well that's exactly

271
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,350
what's happening

272
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,960
[Music]

273
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,010
as you can see in the graph at the

274
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,750
national level a square kilometers bills

275
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,820
have already surpassed the units of

276
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,220
10,000 people living in urban areas and

277
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,380
10,000 inhabitants per square kilometer

278
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,910
is considered a good measure of

279
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,830
population density for the new Chinese

280
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,810
cities basically this means that the

281
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,210
rhythm of construction is already much

282
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,010
quicker than the urban population growth

283
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,720
required to occupy those new cities

284
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,300
that is the perfect recipe for building

285
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,650
empty cities or as they're known in

286
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,410
China ghost cities China local

287
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,330
governments hidden debt could total five

288
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,030
point eight trillion dollars so we could

289
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,860
say that the local Chinese governments

290
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,990
have been affected by something like the

291
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,910
Dutch disease the curse of natural

292
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,010
resources although in this case instead

293
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,170
of natural resources we have real estate

294
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,700
promotions that are financed and

295
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,130
promoted by China's own public banks

296
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,320
even so Chinese President Xi Jinping has

297
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,240
a very different opinion the President

298
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,250
himself has promoted the construction of

299
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,810
another new city from scratch as

300
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,370
personal project or the new area of

301
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,100
Shogun is an area or 120 kilometers from

302
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,110
Beijing that is connected by a 20-minute

303
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,670
trip from the Chinese capital by

304
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,350
high-speed train she wants it to become

305
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,900
a hub for the technology industry we're

306
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,880
talking about a completely ecological

307
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,530
city for which so many trees are going

308
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,300
to be planted that the forest cover in

309
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,640
the area will expand from 11 to 40% with

310
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,230
all this we can assure you of something

311
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,180
china plans to continue building new

312
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,070
cities despite having many empty or

313
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,410
clearly under populated ones so we must

314
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,600
ask ourselves will the Chinese new city

315
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,850
bubble definitely explode and if so how

316
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,810
will this affect their economy

317
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,310
[Music]

318
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,749
we've already told you the one of

319
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,579
China's features is its enormous level

320
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,040
of savings which may indeed finance all

321
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,499
of these wasteful expenses but is it

322
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,110
really reasonable to waste so much money

323
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,120
on cities that are often just ending up

324
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,740
empty will real estate developers and

325
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,439
banks go bankrupt what could happen to

326
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,939
the global economy if this true

327
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,319
addiction to building new cities

328
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:47,360
expanded to other developing countries

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
is it bread today and perhaps hunger

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
tomorrow I'll leave your answer in the
