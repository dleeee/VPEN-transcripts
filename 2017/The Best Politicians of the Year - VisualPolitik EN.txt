1
00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:08.220
so 2017 is coming to an end and just

2
00:00:06.69 --> 00:00:09.870
before the year ends I'd like to say a

3
00:00:08.22 --> 00:00:12.000
big thank you from everyone here at

every week now having said that we want

6
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:17.609
to end this year with what we hope will

7
00:00:15.78 --> 00:00:20.850
be the start of a tradition so without

8
00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:31.289
further ado here are the 2017 visual

9
00:00:20.85 --> 00:00:33.149
politic Awards first of all just a quick

10
00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.190
note it we decided to give out four

11
00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.290
awards because there are four of us here

12
00:00:35.19 --> 00:00:39.090
at visual politic so let's get into them

13
00:00:37.29 --> 00:00:40.350
due to his growing leadership and strong

14
00:00:39.09 --> 00:00:44.340
offense of civil rights one of the

15
00:00:40.35 --> 00:00:46.739
visual politic Awards is for Justin

16
00:00:44.34 --> 00:00:49.850
Trudeau hi everyone will drop to Lamont

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.850
I'm Justin true

18
00:00:55.46 --> 00:00:58.370
it can't be denied the Canadian Prime

19
00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.070
Minister's been one of the great

20
00:00:58.37 --> 00:01:02.120
protagonists of 2017 in think we could

21
00:01:01.07 --> 00:01:03.949
say that it's been a particularly busy

22
00:01:02.12 --> 00:01:05.810
year for Trudeau a year in which this

23
00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.729
young politician has become in the eyes

24
00:01:05.81 --> 00:01:09.530
of the world something of an anti-trump

25
00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.840
and you're not going to give you can you

26
00:01:09.53 --> 00:01:14.390
stay cattle you are fake dues fake news

27
00:01:11.84 --> 00:01:15.050
fake news they are the enemy of the

28
00:01:14.39 --> 00:01:19.940
people

29
00:01:15.05 --> 00:01:21.920
this morning right right hey we've

30
00:01:19.94 --> 00:01:23.149
respect for journalists in this country

31
00:01:21.92 --> 00:01:25.399
they asked tough questions and they're

32
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.440
supposed to okay in the last 12 months

33
00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.509
his actions in the field of human rights

34
00:01:27.44 --> 00:01:30.679
have been quite extensive so how about

35
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.000
we look at some examples

36
00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.830
well the Prime Minister kicked off the

37
00:01:32.0 --> 00:01:36.530
year with the welcome to Canada campaign

38
00:01:33.83 --> 00:01:38.000
which aimed to welcome refugees and we

39
00:01:36.53 --> 00:01:39.590
could say that he's really succeeded and

40
00:01:38.0 --> 00:01:41.030
he's made the European Union look bad at

41
00:01:39.59 --> 00:01:44.110
the same time because of their lack of

42
00:01:41.03 --> 00:01:44.110
commitment on the issue

43
00:01:45.25 --> 00:01:51.469
in recent months Canadians have opened

44
00:01:48.92 --> 00:01:53.719
their hearts and their arms to families

45
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.909
fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria

46
00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.030
and from the moment they arrived those

47
00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.119
31 thousand refugees were welcomed not

48
00:01:59.03 --> 00:02:06.200
as burdens but as neighbors and friends

49
00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.880
as new Canadians in 2017 he also gave

50
00:02:06.2 --> 00:02:09.379
honorary citizenship of Canada to the

51
00:02:07.88 --> 00:02:11.629
Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala

52
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.160
yousufzai a Pakistani activist who

53
00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.110
fights for women's rights and who has

54
00:02:13.16 --> 00:02:17.329
been brutally persecuted and attacked by

55
00:02:15.11 --> 00:02:18.980
the Taliban he has also worked hard as

56
00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.900
we saw in a video on this channel on his

57
00:02:18.98 --> 00:02:23.209
integration and recognition of the

58
00:02:20.9 --> 00:02:24.709
indigenous people in Canada and last but

59
00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.390
not least in a historic speech he made

60
00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.250
before parliament last November Trudeau

61
00:02:26.39 --> 00:02:30.079
officially apologized on behalf of the

62
00:02:28.25 --> 00:02:31.459
federal government for the repression

63
00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.500
that the government exercised against

64
00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.829
members of the LGBT community until the

65
00:02:33.5 --> 00:02:45.610
90s we were wrong we apologize I am

66
00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.610
sorry we are sorry

67
00:02:53.7 --> 00:02:57.500
but that's not all

68
00:02:58.61 --> 00:03:01.940
throughout this year Trudeau's

69
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:03.530
government has also reaffirmed its

70
00:03:01.94 --> 00:03:05.840
intention to legalize the recreational

71
00:03:03.53 --> 00:03:06.950
use of marijuana here's also announced

72
00:03:05.84 --> 00:03:08.660
that the government will increase its

73
00:03:06.95 --> 00:03:10.160
number of residency permits so that new

74
00:03:08.66 --> 00:03:11.540
immigrants can enter the country in

75
00:03:10.16 --> 00:03:12.860
search of a better future

76
00:03:11.54 --> 00:03:15.790
honestly there's not much more you could

77
00:03:12.86 --> 00:03:15.790
ask for in a single year

78
00:03:17.93 --> 00:03:21.140
but some of you might not be thinking

79
00:03:19.37 --> 00:03:22.459
well okay okay there's lots of civil

80
00:03:21.14 --> 00:03:24.620
rights stuff signed but couldn't this

81
00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.420
just be a distraction from the state of

82
00:03:24.62 --> 00:03:28.099
their economy which really isn't working

83
00:03:26.42 --> 00:03:29.930
well actually no because in matters of

84
00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.879
economy it's not actually looking that

85
00:03:29.93 --> 00:03:34.670
bad either the Canadian economy expects

86
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.500
to close 2017 with 3% growth and its

87
00:03:34.67 --> 00:03:39.170
lowest unemployment rate in ten years

88
00:03:36.5 --> 00:03:40.909
along these same lines in 2017 Trudeau

89
00:03:39.17 --> 00:03:41.840
ratified his free trade agreement with

90
00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.370
the European Union

91
00:03:41.84 --> 00:03:46.159
he is also set his sights on Asia

92
00:03:43.37 --> 00:03:49.639
especially China China will soon be the

93
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.159
largest market in the world it's home to

94
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.500
1 billion potential customers for the

95
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.200
high-quality goods and services the

96
00:03:54.5 --> 00:03:58.549
Canadians deliver every day it's true

97
00:03:57.2 --> 00:04:00.439
that things are going slower than

98
00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.060
expected but even so there's a very good

99
00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.250
chance that Canada will end up becoming

100
00:04:02.06 --> 00:04:08.389
a great bridge between the American and

101
00:04:04.25 --> 00:04:10.040
Chinese economies yes that is right

102
00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.530
folks and while we may not completely

103
00:04:10.04 --> 00:04:14.120
agree with Justin Trudeau's agenda we do

104
00:04:12.53 --> 00:04:16.250
think that he is contributing to the

105
00:04:14.12 --> 00:04:17.720
construction of a better and freer world

106
00:04:16.25 --> 00:04:20.979
for all so from all of us

107
00:04:17.72 --> 00:04:20.979
congratulations Justin

108
00:04:25.56 --> 00:04:34.100
the next visual politic award is for

109
00:04:29.51 --> 00:04:34.100
sighing when the president of Taiwan

110
00:04:40.27 --> 00:04:44.060
and this price is a bit special and

111
00:04:42.56 --> 00:04:46.040
somewhat different because with it we

112
00:04:44.06 --> 00:04:51.020
won't recognize political success but

113
00:04:46.04 --> 00:04:52.820
rather the ability to resist allow me to

114
00:04:51.02 --> 00:04:54.650
explain we decided to give this award -

115
00:04:52.82 --> 00:04:56.240
sighing Wang for two main reasons

116
00:04:54.65 --> 00:04:58.220
first for the Inc first female president

117
00:04:56.24 --> 00:05:00.710
of Taiwan and for being a symbol to

118
00:04:58.22 --> 00:05:02.570
other East Asian societies I think the

119
00:05:00.71 --> 00:05:04.940
young people are generally excited about

120
00:05:02.57 --> 00:05:06.889
this idea of having a woman to leave the

121
00:05:04.94 --> 00:05:09.560
country oh they thought it was rather

122
00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.630
trendy and second for her firm will to

123
00:05:09.56 --> 00:05:13.430
defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom in

124
00:05:11.63 --> 00:05:15.260
the face of Beijing's desire for

125
00:05:13.43 --> 00:05:16.580
reunification because let's not forget

126
00:05:15.26 --> 00:05:18.889
that this country has one of the most

127
00:05:16.58 --> 00:05:21.470
flourishing and alive democracies in the

128
00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:27.950
region and China as you may know is a

129
00:05:21.47 --> 00:05:29.690
dictatorship the fact is that 2017 has

130
00:05:27.95 --> 00:05:34.130
been a difficult year for the islands

131
00:05:29.69 --> 00:05:36.289
and for its president China has

132
00:05:34.13 --> 00:05:38.240
unleashed a political and economic war

133
00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.070
against Taiwan the likes of which has

134
00:05:38.24 --> 00:05:41.960
not been seen for years this all

135
00:05:40.07 --> 00:05:44.630
resulted in presidents size refusal to

136
00:05:41.96 --> 00:05:46.340
commit to the so-called 1992 consensus

137
00:05:44.63 --> 00:05:49.660
and agreement under which China is

138
00:05:46.34 --> 00:05:49.660
recognized as a single entity

139
00:05:55.07 --> 00:05:58.220
and of course if something's clear it is

140
00:05:57.08 --> 00:06:00.710
that all this economic and political

141
00:05:58.22 --> 00:06:02.660
pressure poses a huge problem for this

142
00:06:00.71 --> 00:06:06.250
country 40 percent of its exports

143
00:06:02.66 --> 00:06:06.250
currently depend on mainland China

144
00:06:06.58 --> 00:06:11.450
however the viewer far from surrendering

145
00:06:09.14 --> 00:06:13.220
citing Wang's government has reinforced

146
00:06:11.45 --> 00:06:15.410
its political strategy to sink and

147
00:06:13.22 --> 00:06:17.210
consolidate alternatives to China mainly

148
00:06:15.41 --> 00:06:22.670
opening up to the Southeast Asian

149
00:06:17.21 --> 00:06:25.190
Australian and New Zealand markets this

150
00:06:22.67 --> 00:06:26.810
is known as the new south bound policy

151
00:06:25.19 --> 00:06:28.520
and so far there has also been pretty

152
00:06:26.81 --> 00:06:30.680
good trade with these countries is

153
00:06:28.52 --> 00:06:32.180
growing strongly at rates of 7%

154
00:06:30.68 --> 00:06:34.130
the Taiwanese economy has also regained

155
00:06:32.18 --> 00:06:38.420
some vigour and investors have regained

156
00:06:34.13 --> 00:06:40.070
confidence in this country this has

157
00:06:38.42 --> 00:06:42.200
resulted in quite a bit of pressure on

158
00:06:40.07 --> 00:06:43.490
China so well even though we don't like

159
00:06:42.2 --> 00:06:45.110
some of the things about this government

160
00:06:43.49 --> 00:06:47.030
such as their slowness when facing

161
00:06:45.11 --> 00:06:49.250
reforms we really believe that their

162
00:06:47.03 --> 00:06:52.510
spirit of resistance to Chinese pressure

163
00:06:49.25 --> 00:06:52.510
justifies this choice

164
00:06:55.91 --> 00:07:00.080
yep fiction with Beijing may not be most

165
00:06:58.31 --> 00:07:01.520
convenient for the islands interests but

166
00:07:00.08 --> 00:07:03.380
I think we need to make two things clear

167
00:07:01.52 --> 00:07:04.790
first when we talk about resistance

168
00:07:03.38 --> 00:07:06.680
we're talking about protecting one of

169
00:07:04.79 --> 00:07:09.530
the most democratic and liberal regimes

170
00:07:06.68 --> 00:07:11.510
in Asia and second according to polls

171
00:07:09.53 --> 00:07:13.250
this policy is clearly backed by

172
00:07:11.51 --> 00:07:15.590
Taiwanese society due to all of this

173
00:07:13.25 --> 00:07:18.880
sighing when gets one of this year's

174
00:07:15.59 --> 00:07:18.880
visual politic awards

175
00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.199
so let's continue and this next order

176
00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:30.129
doesn't just go to one politician but it

177
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:34.629
goes to an entire political party and

178
00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.629
this would be V check pirate party

179
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:43.129
missing it but see Chucky and so now you

180
00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:46.539
might be wondering well why are we

181
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.539
giving this award to the check pirates

182
00:07:47.14 --> 00:07:50.290
well that's because they came in third

183
00:07:48.82 --> 00:07:51.730
in the Czech parliamentary elections

184
00:07:50.29 --> 00:07:53.890
that occurred this year being at the

185
00:07:51.73 --> 00:07:55.510
second-most voted for pirate party on

186
00:07:53.89 --> 00:07:58.740
the planet only surpassed by the

187
00:07:55.51 --> 00:07:58.740
Icelandic pirate party

188
00:07:58.77 --> 00:08:03.490
the first question to be answered here

189
00:08:01.12 --> 00:08:05.500
is what does the pirate party stand for

190
00:08:03.49 --> 00:08:06.880
wealthy pirate ideology or as they like

191
00:08:05.5 --> 00:08:09.310
to call it the pirate movements that was

192
00:08:06.88 --> 00:08:11.320
born in Sweden in the Year 2005 they

193
00:08:09.31 --> 00:08:13.660
wanted to protect online privacy and to

194
00:08:11.32 --> 00:08:14.530
reform copyright laws this is why

195
00:08:13.66 --> 00:08:16.240
they're called the pirate party

196
00:08:14.53 --> 00:08:18.250
according to them copyright laws are

197
00:08:16.24 --> 00:08:24.520
needless barriers font revenues can only

198
00:08:18.25 --> 00:08:25.810
help big corporations stay on top ok so

199
00:08:24.52 --> 00:08:27.490
just hold on a second here because I

200
00:08:25.81 --> 00:08:29.950
know what you're thinking now does this

201
00:08:27.49 --> 00:08:31.810
mean that we add visual politic are

202
00:08:29.95 --> 00:08:33.520
against copyright and intellectual

203
00:08:31.81 --> 00:08:35.260
property law well far from it because

204
00:08:33.52 --> 00:08:37.600
the truth is that the pirate movement it

205
00:08:35.26 --> 00:08:39.220
has changed a lot since 2005 now their

206
00:08:37.6 --> 00:08:41.050
manifesto covers far more than what it

207
00:08:39.22 --> 00:08:44.410
started with from economics foreign

208
00:08:41.05 --> 00:08:45.910
policy it's like there's now a big

209
00:08:44.41 --> 00:08:47.710
difference between the pirate parties in

210
00:08:45.91 --> 00:08:49.120
different countries just like a Swedish

211
00:08:47.71 --> 00:08:50.860
Social Democrat is totally different

212
00:08:49.12 --> 00:08:53.410
from a Spanish social democrat and

213
00:08:50.86 --> 00:08:55.660
Icelandic pirate is seldom similar to a

214
00:08:53.41 --> 00:09:01.450
Czech pirate so well what if a Czech

215
00:08:55.66 --> 00:09:02.560
pirate stand for well first of all tag

216
00:09:01.45 --> 00:09:04.300
lovers as they are they want to

217
00:09:02.56 --> 00:09:05.980
implement eager Vermont solutions in

218
00:09:04.3 --> 00:09:07.960
these same vein as Estonia

219
00:09:05.98 --> 00:09:09.460
it really makes absolutely no sense that

220
00:09:07.96 --> 00:09:11.140
today in the 21st century you need to

221
00:09:09.46 --> 00:09:12.700
wait in line for more than four hours in

222
00:09:11.14 --> 00:09:14.500
an administrative office in order to

223
00:09:12.7 --> 00:09:16.690
report that you changed your residence

224
00:09:14.5 --> 00:09:18.850
this happens to day in the Czech

225
00:09:16.69 --> 00:09:20.230
Republic and because I live here this is

226
00:09:18.85 --> 00:09:24.070
something I've had to do and it is an

227
00:09:20.23 --> 00:09:25.720
enormous pain in the ass and listen this

228
00:09:24.07 --> 00:09:27.580
kind of bureaucracy madness it is not

229
00:09:25.72 --> 00:09:30.010
only time consuming but it's also a big

230
00:09:27.58 --> 00:09:31.990
share of the government's budget Estonia

231
00:09:30.01 --> 00:09:33.880
has saved millions thanks to these

232
00:09:31.99 --> 00:09:35.560
reforms and they should be a model for

233
00:09:33.88 --> 00:09:36.550
other countries plus the Czech pirates

234
00:09:35.56 --> 00:09:38.170
they stand for freedom of movement

235
00:09:36.55 --> 00:09:39.910
freedom of speech and fiscal

236
00:09:38.17 --> 00:09:41.740
responsibility during their campaign

237
00:09:39.91 --> 00:09:43.870
they avoided the temptation of promising

238
00:09:41.74 --> 00:09:46.360
more spending or giving grants to anyone

239
00:09:43.87 --> 00:09:48.760
which was especially alluring in an

240
00:09:46.36 --> 00:09:50.620
election full of populist candidates and

241
00:09:48.76 --> 00:09:53.220
on top of all that well they want to

242
00:09:50.62 --> 00:09:53.220
legalize weed

243
00:09:53.87 --> 00:09:58.020
so if this program the check pirates

244
00:09:56.28 --> 00:10:00.000
came in third in one of the Czech

245
00:09:58.02 --> 00:10:02.370
Republic's most notable elections in

246
00:10:00.0 --> 00:10:04.350
history usually in most countries there

247
00:10:02.37 --> 00:10:05.730
are two or three main political forces

248
00:10:04.35 --> 00:10:08.040
but not anymore in the Czech Republic

249
00:10:05.73 --> 00:10:10.320
first place went to an abuti Alip and

250
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:12.420
their leader andrey babish but he only

251
00:10:10.32 --> 00:10:14.670
obtains less than 30 percent of the vote

252
00:10:12.42 --> 00:10:16.830
after him is the center-right ods party

253
00:10:14.67 --> 00:10:18.060
who made up little more than 10% and

254
00:10:16.83 --> 00:10:22.190
below those with almost the same

255
00:10:18.06 --> 00:10:22.190
percentage there are the Pirates the

256
00:10:23.36 --> 00:10:27.630
Pirates surpassed other charismatic and

257
00:10:25.95 --> 00:10:29.790
radical politicians like the Communist

258
00:10:27.63 --> 00:10:31.950
Party and mr. Tomio Okumura an

259
00:10:29.79 --> 00:10:33.810
anti-immigration candidate and just as a

260
00:10:31.95 --> 00:10:38.790
funny you know dear mr. Okumura is

261
00:10:33.81 --> 00:10:39.900
actually originally from Japan so when

262
00:10:38.79 --> 00:10:41.520
walking around prague during the

263
00:10:39.9 --> 00:10:43.620
elections you could see a big picture of

264
00:10:41.52 --> 00:10:45.690
a japanese dude which says say no to

265
00:10:43.62 --> 00:10:47.400
immigration it was actually pretty funny

266
00:10:45.69 --> 00:10:49.500
so in other words the Czech Pirates have

267
00:10:47.4 --> 00:10:51.330
obtained surprising results with a solid

268
00:10:49.5 --> 00:10:52.950
and rational manifesto some of their

269
00:10:51.33 --> 00:10:54.720
proposals certainly better than others

270
00:10:52.95 --> 00:10:57.150
but in general they deserve our applause

271
00:10:54.72 --> 00:11:00.140
sorry Klaatu you lemon machine platinum

272
00:10:57.15 --> 00:11:00.140
zipper at schist Roni

273
00:11:01.21 --> 00:11:05.030
last but not least the fourth award

274
00:11:03.32 --> 00:11:11.300
because he couldn't be left out of this

275
00:11:05.03 --> 00:11:15.460
list goes to Emmanuel macron make our

276
00:11:11.3 --> 00:11:15.460
planet great again

277
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:21.360
well what can we say about mr. Mac Ron

278
00:11:19.68 --> 00:11:22.949
he is one of the biggest surprises of

279
00:11:21.36 --> 00:11:25.529
the year first of all he had to create

280
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:26.999
his own political party from zero yes

281
00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:28.619
you heard that right he started his

282
00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:30.660
political career as the finance minister

283
00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:32.759
inside the social democrat government of

284
00:11:30.66 --> 00:11:34.889
manuel valls but he was not affiliated

285
00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:36.899
with that party he was an independent

286
00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:38.009
hard because of his achievements working

287
00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:40.490
in the finance industry

288
00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:44.309
I want France to be a start-up nation

289
00:11:40.49 --> 00:11:48.660
meaning both a nation that works with

290
00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:53.249
and for the startups but also a nation

291
00:11:48.66 --> 00:11:56.100
that thinks and moves like a start-up

292
00:11:53.249 --> 00:11:58.230
and make no mistake here he has not had

293
00:11:56.1 --> 00:12:00.540
an easy job France has been in crisis

294
00:11:58.23 --> 00:12:01.860
for years as we said in this other video

295
00:12:00.54 --> 00:12:03.749
the country used to be one of the

296
00:12:01.86 --> 00:12:05.429
world's biggest economies but now it's

297
00:12:03.749 --> 00:12:08.040
companies find it hard to compete in the

298
00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:09.899
international market part of this is due

299
00:12:08.04 --> 00:12:11.339
to their economic policies the truth is

300
00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:12.990
that for decades France followed the

301
00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:14.639
ideology of Charles de Gaulle the man

302
00:12:12.99 --> 00:12:20.699
who led the country's economy as if it

303
00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:22.470
was an army de Gaulle was obsessed with

304
00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:24.779
protecting French companies from the

305
00:12:22.47 --> 00:12:27.629
outside world but the world is rather

306
00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:29.879
different today and macron wants a 180

307
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:32.209
degree shift from this French economic

308
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:32.209
theory

309
00:12:35.26 --> 00:12:39.589
his manifesto it was solid and it was

310
00:12:37.82 --> 00:12:41.330
rational he didn't promise any of those

311
00:12:39.589 --> 00:12:43.580
things which are impossible to achieve

312
00:12:41.33 --> 00:12:45.350
once you are in office and despite all

313
00:12:43.58 --> 00:12:47.240
of this you won by a landslide victory

314
00:12:45.35 --> 00:12:49.250
and that's not only in the presidential

315
00:12:47.24 --> 00:12:51.470
elections but the parliamentary ones too

316
00:12:49.25 --> 00:12:53.420
and if this wasn't impressive enough he

317
00:12:51.47 --> 00:12:56.000
also did it against marine lepen the

318
00:12:53.42 --> 00:12:58.160
champion of European populism prior to

319
00:12:56.0 --> 00:13:00.350
the foundation of mr. macrons party on

320
00:12:58.16 --> 00:13:03.470
marsh pollsters are said all a pen has

321
00:13:00.35 --> 00:13:05.450
the victory guaranteed but micron proved

322
00:13:03.47 --> 00:13:07.820
them wrong now we just ask him not to

323
00:13:05.45 --> 00:13:13.040
disappoint us in 2018 and in the

324
00:13:07.82 --> 00:13:15.080
meantime congratulations emmanuel well

325
00:13:13.04 --> 00:13:16.459

326
00:13:15.08 --> 00:13:18.050
awards they hope you enjoyed them and

327
00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:20.959
