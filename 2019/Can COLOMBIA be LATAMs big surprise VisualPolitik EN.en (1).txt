37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,420

the FARC disarmament according to the

39
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,840

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,190
12,000 130 homicides last year 6.7% more

41
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,530
than in 2017 and the violence isn't

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,420
limited to drug deals gone bad or

43
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,250
territorial disputes in the last three

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,899

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,420
500 community activists and leaders lost

their lives at the hands of these groups

47

as if all of these problems weren't

63
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,079
enough Columbia has recently had to deal

64
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,400
with the arrival of hundreds of

65

that proximately 1.5 million Venezuelans

68
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,079
already live in Colombia one thing that

69
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,970
is very positive is the Colombian

70
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,739
Solidarity that's been witnessed the

71
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,450
problem is that this influx of people

72
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,280
also puts enormous pressure on stability

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,439
and public resources okay so let's say

74
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,359
that this is the downside but it's not

75
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,709
all bad news

76
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:14,599
in Colombia you see despite all the

77
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,189
continuing problems such as drug

78
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,989

80
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,739
has actually registered an economic

81
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,169
growth of 3.8 percent per year over the

82
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,359
last 40 years the middle class has grown

in the country hasn't suffered any

84
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,430
hyperinflation and don't think this is

85
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,650
normal because it's anything but and

86
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,790
don't forget that we're talking about

87
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,950

at some point in time in other words we

91
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,829
could almost say that Colombia is a

92
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,569
model of stability however Colombian

93
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,910

colombian president yvonne bouquet

96
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,630
affirms that he isn't satisfied with the

97
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,460
more than three percent growth that the

98
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,140
Colombian economy is expected to have

99
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,970
this year and intends to quote push the

100
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,620
country to grow by more than five

101
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:20,500
percent annually yes the colombian

102
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,870
president has set a goal of five percent

103
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,400
now how will they be able to achieve

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,350
this how will they go about it it seems

105
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,300
complicated considering the scenario

106
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,190
that's been described doesn't it well

107
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,480
you know what we can't say if you'll be

108
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,250
successful or not but the important

109
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,020
thing is that this government has a plan

110
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,390
which unfortunately doesn't seem to

111
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,130
happen very often these days right

112
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,700
president Macri and it's a plan that

113
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,650
doesn't look too bad and which we can

114
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,260
summarize into three main points so

115
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,370
listen up

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,639
[Music]

117
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,050
fleeing latin-american taxation this may

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,520
come as a surprise but in general

119
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,439
latin-american countries tax systems

120
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,629
have one common characteristic and

121
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:07,919
that's that they have the highest

122
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,629
corporate taxes on the planet on an

123
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:15,420
example

124
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,580
the inability of the government to raise

125
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,650
money from living flesh-and-blood people

126
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,920
has made them tax the productive system

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:29,520
voraciously this is quite the opposite

128
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,350
of the example set by Nordic countries

129
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,670
and they are often held up as a

130
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,380
benchmark and if Latin America is

131
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,120
usually a disaster in this field

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,400
Colombia is the worst of the worst but

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,450
ok so something you might now be

134
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,130
wondering are silent I mean how much

135
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,290
worse could it probably be 1.2 vines

136
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,780
maybe well not even close

137
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,919
[Music]

138
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,960
to give you an idea according to the

139
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,580
latest doing business report from the

140
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,530
world's bank the effective tax rate on

141
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,539
Colombian companies that is if we

142
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,279
consider all the tax as a company is

143
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,289
obliged to pay local national labor

144
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,759
corporate then it turns out that

145
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,460
Colombian companies face an average rate

146
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,099
of seventy one point nine percent

147
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,689
seventy one point nine percent of the

148
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,370
company's commercial profit and is the

149
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,199
difference between income and expenses

150
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,210
without taking taxes into account goes

151
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,759
directly into the public administrations

152
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,409
pockets to give you an idea when a

153
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,479
Colombian company buys a machine v80

154
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:27,279
cannot be fully deducted for that

155
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,379
purchase and companies have to pay taxes

156
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,599
even if they are losing money it's all

157
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,789
pretty crazy then obviously all of this

158
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:40,629
does have consequences such high taxes

159
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:42,250
on the productive sector affect the

160
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,020
Colombian economy's ability to be

161
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,060
competitive and on top of this we have

162
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,580
to add the exhausting and tedious

163
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,460
bureaucracy that is so typical of Latin

164
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,319
American countries basically under these

165
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,210
conditions it would be easier to win a

166
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,189
fight against in his prime Floyd

167
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,289
Mayweather than it would be to start a

168
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:01,719
business that works so surely now you

169
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:03,279
might understand why Latin American

170
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,349
countries generally have low investment

171
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,479
levels low export levels and a lot of

172
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,930
informal economies Latin America's

173
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,969
informal economy surpasses that of

[Music]

176
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,510
in fact it's estimated that more than

177
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,010
54% of Colombian companies aren't

178
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,110
operating within official guidelines and

179
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,700
of course an informal economy can't

180
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,950
access large contracts it can't get bank

181
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,510
financing and it doesn't have legal

182
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,310
security which often means they just

183
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,810
can't grow while addressing the

184
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,850
situation is precisely the first major

185
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,100
point of due case plan in facts at the

186
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,840
end of last year he got his Congress of

187
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,430

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,139
comprehensive tax reform his tax reform

189
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,550
basically the reform aims to reduce the

190
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,440
tax requirements of Colombian companies

191
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,320
by slightly increasing taxes on personal

192
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,330
income for example on people who earn

193
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,830
more than a hundred and twenty thousand

194
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,690
dollars a year and who currently pay low

195
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,060
taxes the reform will also increase v80

196
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,010
collection so with the new reform

197
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,270
corporate income tax will be

198
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,430
progressively reduced from thirty three

199
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,350
to thirty percent some additional taxes

200
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,600
will disappear and a simplified single

201
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,760
tax system with very low rates will be

202
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,340
created to encourage the formalization

203
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,010
and growth of small businesses and

204
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,260
that's not all in addition the reform

205
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,150
has also created tax incentives for

206
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,160
entrepreneurs for investments in large

207
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,050
projects investments in the tourism

208
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,669
sector and in the so called orange

209
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,890
economy and yes okay this may seem

210
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,050
controversial after all why applying to

211
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,000
some sectors and not others but at least

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,620
it seems to be a step in the right

213
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,159
direction the problem and perhaps what

214
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,960
has made this project so controversial

215
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,790
is that duque is going to increase

216
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,680
public spending significantly and the

217
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,420
government already has a very high

218
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,580
public deficit so even though the

219
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,470
measure means a reduction of taxes in

220
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,270
the medium term the truth is that in the

221
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,770
short term it implies increasing them

222
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,750
that is what other reductions are

223
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,160
progressive and will be applied

224
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,350
gradually the increases will be applied

225
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,240
from the very beginning for example

226
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,020
there's going to be a temporary

227
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,290
surcharge on bank profits and this well

228
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,390
it hasn't been popular but still and you

229
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,740
know the non visual politic we don't

230
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,630
like tax increases at all we think the

231
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,950
change is a step in the right direction

232
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,620
Latin America in general in Colombia in

233
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,600
particular have to treat the productive

234
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,120
sectors better Latin America needs more

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,310
companies not more taxes unfortunately

236
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,630
this reform has been declared

237
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,000
unconstitutional due to a formality now

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
the government has to get it approved

239
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,960
again by Congress so could president de

240
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,210
Kate get it through

243
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,420
in Yvonne Dukas strategy is to promote

244
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,700
the so-called orange economy with fiscal

249
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,420
we want during what what on earth is the

maybe you've noticed that more and more

260
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,200
movies are being filmed in Colombia even

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,910
more productions from platforms such as

262
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,220
Netflix or Amazon Prime are being made

263
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,870
in this country and there's a good

264
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,200
reason for this in 2012

265
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,390
lor one five five six was passed which

266
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,430
provides significant tax breaks and aid

267
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,200
to produce and shoot films and

268
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,210
television series in Colombia that way

269
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,830
they not only sought to grow the

270
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,450
national film industry but also to

271
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,580
foster a better image of the country

272
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,350
around the world this resulted in a

273
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,060
soaring number of productions that were

274
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,870
shot in Colombia well now Ivonne Duque

275
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,310
wants to do the same with all the

276
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,170
activities that make up this orange

277
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,000
economy and pay attention because this

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,040
is serious business today Colombia's

279
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
orange economy is almost three times

280
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,130
larger than the coffee industry and

281
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,380
almost as big as the entire mining

282
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,180
sector we're talking about economic

283
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,040
activities whose worldwide trade rose at

284
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,440
annual rates of 7% and whose value in

285
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,900
2015 exceeded five hundred billion

286
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,870
dollars the orange economy is larger

287
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,150
than new oil oil reserves are limited

288
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,730
but creativity is unlimited we have to

289
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,440
know that the most important heritage we

290
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,630
have in a society is the talent of its

291
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,000
people Yvonne Duke a well in order to

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,740
boost other orange economy activities

293
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,240
the government is implementing

294
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,610
participatory financing plans venture

295
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,380
capital initiatives entrepreneurship

296
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,660
centers and tax exemptions so will it

297
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,760
work will the orange economy or really

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,710
be able to transform Colombia well only

299
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,730
time will tell

300
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,270
but you know what the plan it

301
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:58,690
sound pretty good and the plan is

302
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,550
different in that it is linked to human

303
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,770
capital and not just natural resources

304
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,330
or large companies that have

305
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,640
suspiciously close ties to governments

306
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,490
which unfortunately is a bit of the norm

307
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,440
in Latin America but it doesn't end

308
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
there we still have a third essential

309
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,720
pillar in this strategy

[Music]

313
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,160
it isn't strictly avant do k's idea but

314
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,810
it looks like the new government has

315
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,140
accepted it

316
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,730
Columbia wants to become a big player in

317
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,050
the world's market for medical cannabis

318
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,970
this is a sector that is quite literally

319
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,680
growing like weeds and is expected to

320
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,750
become a market of almost 50 billion

321
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,360
dollars by 2025 and Columbia intends to

322
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,550
have a slice of that pie more than 40%

323
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,589
of it we're talking about a huge sector

324
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:51,149
and a considerable boost for the

325
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,920
Colombian economy especially for the

326
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,920
economy in the poorest rural areas it

327
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
calls us to the possibility of being

328
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,370
very important worldwide players in

329
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,560
terms of exports estimates state that we

330
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,660
could effectively reach levels of six

331
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,060
billion dollars u.s. annually in exports

so along with pointy green weeds the

335
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,990
government's other big gamble consists

336
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,120
of promoting fracking to increase oil

337
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,800
production so far four pilot projects

338
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,150
have been approved that could produce

339
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,880
more than 400,000 barrels per day when

340
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,230
fully operational this would mean

341
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,300
increasing Colombia's oil production by

342
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,440
almost 50 percent

344
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,449
in conclusion with all these measures

345
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:41,980
with greater investments in

346
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,690
infrastructure and education

347
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,190
Ivan Duke his government plans to

348
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,959
achieve its objective of raising

349
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,910
Columbia's economic growth to above 5%

350
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,100
so will they achieve it well here on

351
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,329
digital politic we'll be watching

352
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,220
closely but as thing stands doesn't look

353
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,930
too bad of course there are other issues

354
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,970
yet to resolve which could generate self

355
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,620
reports for example the sharp increase

356
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,389
in public spending or the constant

357
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,550
devaluation of the Colombian peso and of

358
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,139
course Duke A's government has unlimited

359
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,300
itself to act only in the economic
