1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
if we talk in economic terms political

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,270
terms would be quite different in at

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,830
least the last two decades Peru has

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,080
become a benchmark for Latin American

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:16,289
countries with higher economic growth

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,940
rates and a lot of commercial openness

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,770
Peru has experienced a decrease in

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,720
poverty and has seen the middle class

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,430
grow throughout the country in recent

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,199
years however hold on a second because

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,000
this virtuous cycle of economic

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
prosperity it could be reaching its end

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,420
and not only that through all these

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,980
years although things are gone

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,110
reasonably well some problems haven't

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,129
been solved at all

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,260
for example Peru's huge dependence on

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,510
raw material back of diversification and

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,340
inability to join global production

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,540
chains

21
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,010
and all of this leads us to some

22
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,660
questions will prairie be able to

23
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,730
overcome these issues and emulate the

24
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,860
Asian Tigers come the country joined the

25
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,840
fourth Industrial Revolution and why on

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,280
earth haven't they yet managed to

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,900
overcome their dependence on raw

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,520
materials well we're gonna try and

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,630
answer these questions

30
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,850
in today's video but first we need to

31
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,130
take a look at the causes of Peru's take

32
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:19,560
off the foundations of the Peruvian push

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,750
so what has driven Peru's success in the

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,670
last 25 years this is a very brought in

35
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,619
question for Peru for the other Latin

36
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,240
American countries and practically

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,160
anyone who wants to seek their own

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,810
country escape poverty well to answer

39
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,670
this question we need to highlight two

40
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,690
major points

41
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,000
the first is orthodoxy and macroeconomic

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,040
stability and no don't worry it's not

43
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,570
boring at all see one of the keys to

44
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,490
Peru's growth is that its various

45
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,690
governments have opted for continuity

46
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,160
Nora Republica our hero really know

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,330
stories puesto la espalda amy police

48
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,610
near la democracia this means that the

49
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,200
country's political leaders have had

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,570
political differences just like everyone

51
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,610
else it's inevitable and good that they

52
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,080
also understand that there was a

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,149
development model a country model that

54
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:12,460
they couldn't touch Alberto Fujimori

55
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,800
Alejandro Toledo Alan Garcia in his

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,050
second term of course AIA honza Ramallah

57
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,410
Pedro Pablo Kaczynski and now Martin vez

58
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,690
kura six presidents with different

59
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,520
political approaches but basically the

60
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,590
same economic model it reminds me of the

61
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,850
Lord of the Rings but instead of the

62
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,680
ring there's an economic model one model

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,110
to rule them all the fact is that in the

64
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,600
last 25 years Peru has had its deficits

65
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,640
and public debt under control and they

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,020
have respected the central bank's

67
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,910
independence and avoided the temptation

68
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,709
to run the bill printing machine and

69
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,910
they've generally prompted investment

70
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,650
for example let's take a look at the

71
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,330
evolution of foreign investments in the

72
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,610
country see between 1980 and 1994 it

73
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,460
barely doubles but between 1994 and 2005

74
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,190
it multiplied by 4 and between 2005 and

75
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,800
today it's multiplying it by almost 7

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,420
that is to say foreign investment has

77
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,050
grown more and more in less time

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,690
rates to average almost 6% per year for

81
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:25,900
more than 15 years check this out at an

82
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,220
APEC meeting they asked me what I

83
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,690
thought would happen to the Peruvian

84
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,180
economy in the international crisis and

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,190
I said that the only thing I was sure of

86
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,200
was that the country I was going to grow

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,780
the most this year was Peru Luis Alberto

88
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,080
Moreno president of the inter-american

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,250
Development Bank of course economic

90
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,260
growth ends up favouring almost everyone

91
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,000
in one way or another you don't have to

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,530
have a nobel prize in economics to

93
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,770
understand that one

00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,300
period of time the purchasing power per

97
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,550
capita almost doubles and poverty fell

98
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,250
by 30 percentage points

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,310
but percentages are sometimes hard to

101
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,900
understand to really understand the

102
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,490
importance of such a reduction in

103
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,410
poverty we should talk about people

104
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,170
seven million Peruvians left poverty in

105
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,820
the last fifteen years thanks to the

macroeconomic continuity the country's

turn of the century and it remains today

115
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:47,589
today Peru has free trade agreements

116
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,479
with no less than the three major

117
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,819
economic zones the United States China

118
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,099
and the European Union it's also part of

119
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,169
the Pacific Alliance and in general its

120
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,300
foreign policy is very much aimed at

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,490
achieving new trade agreements and all

122
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,469
this of course it certainly has its

123
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,909
consequences exports have increased from

124
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:09,009
three billion dollars in 1990 to more

125
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,619
than 52 billion dollars today in other

126
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:20,169
words they've multiplied by 17 but hold

127
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,389
on a second let's not bring the bells of

128
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,270
Success just yet these results they have

129
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,520
been fantastic that's certainly true but

130
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,649
now the model it seems just a bit

131
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:31,899
exhausted and yes you know we love

132
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,729
talking about good things and of course

133
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,369
Peru has many good things going for it

134
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,399
but guys like with Enron Blockbuster and

136
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,639
things don't end well indeed often they

137
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,800
will just hit you right in the face so

138
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,939
let's have a look at the main problems

139
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,110
that are preventing this country from

140
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,449
emulating the Tigers and the Dragons of

141
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:53,670

[Music]

143
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,590
the peril that breaks Peru hasn't

144
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,630
escaped poverty yet despite its almost

145
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,550
25 years of uninterrupted growth the

146
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,620
country still has a lot of poverty worst

147
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,180
of all despite this growth in recent

148
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,130
years the Peruvian economy has been like

149
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,770
a balloon with an air leak that could

150
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,790
get a lot bigger allow me to explain

151
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,800
Peru continues to grow but its slowdown

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,630
is becoming more than evidence the

153
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,550
country is growing less and confidence

154
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,290
among businessman has decreased a lot

155
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,880
but that's not the worst part the worst

156
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,770
part is that the biggest changes they're

157
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,620
slow to arrive much sir than expected as

158
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,060
we've already mentioned there's still a

159
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
lot of poverty in the country and in

160
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,360
spite of all the growth it still doesn't

161
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,880
have a productive diversified and modern

162
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,780
economy essentially Peru continues to

163
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,910
depend on raw materials and now if its

164
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,800
growth slows down the question is well

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,570
how much longer is it gonna take for

166
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,139
things to change

167
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,720
we don't know but what we can try to do

168
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,819
is explain why it's so hard to make

169
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,919
changes in this country well here are

we're probably working to agree on this

175
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,800
one is that is political and it's got to

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,690
do with corruption

well that's just the tip of the iceberg

180
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,270

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,350
dies after shooting himself before

189
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,510
arrest but this isn't the only political

190
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,600
mess in Peru parties get on so badly and

191
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,940
politics is so polarized and fragmented

192
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,380
that agreements are as difficult to

193
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,480
reach as say presidential candidacy

194
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,940
composed of Mauricio Macri and Cristina

195
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,980
Fernandez de Kirchner well actually now

196
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,180
that we think about that one it wouldn't

197
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:39,960
be so hard to see

198
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,760
the fact is that of course this economic

199
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,530
polarization has stagnated the deep

200
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,870
facto economic reforms agenda since the

201
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,490
international crisis the country has

202
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,590
barely made any significant structural

203
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:58,180
reforms but some claim that the

204
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,770
government's in the Congress's lack of

205
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,660
productivity had a positive effect back

206
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,580
in the day the economic reforms of the

207
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,500
90s remained in place because of how

208
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,480
little the political class could get

209
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,700
done that is to say this immobile ISM

210
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,500
prevented politicians from changing the

211
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,420
country's economic course leading to the

212
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,010
aforementioned stability but of course

213
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,380
the problem is that time passes and

214
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:29,600
eventually changes are required

215
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,880
but that's all in the ends between their

216
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,710
corruption and their inability to reach

217
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,630
agreements Peruvian politicians have

218
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,220
turned Peru in suit the latin-american

219
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,710
country with the least confidence in

220
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,570
their political organizations in other

221
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,370
words Peruvians would trust vito

222
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,830
corleone or Darth Vader more than they

223
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,060
would their own politicians

224
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,829
[Music]

225
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,449
the second problem is that the

226
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,040
apparently good performance of the

227
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,959
country's economy has covered hidden and

228
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,179
camouflaged other issues which haven't

229
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:00,619
progressed well one of them is

230
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,629
productivity which hasn't only not

231
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,730
improved but since as far back as 1975

232
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,819
it's actually progressed negatively yep

233
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,499
yeah that right progressed negatively

234
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:12,199
it's a thing in the long term the net

235
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,540
result shows a secular stagnation in

236
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,549
Peru's productivity this is the main

237
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,459
cause of its lack of convergence of per

238
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,829
capita income with that of more advanced

239
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,980
economies Marta Reese runs idv advisor

240
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,589
now why is this important well folks to

241
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,209
look at it another way with data in

242
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,860
hands this means that a single American

243
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,860
worker is as productive as five Peruvian

244
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,069
workers and of course this comp be 70

245
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,809
years ago this figure wasn't five but

246
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,610
three an American worker was three times

247
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,470
more productive than a Peruvian worker

248
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,959
today though he or she is five times

249
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,070
more productive

250
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,879
[Music]

251
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,019
mind you this doesn't mean Peruvians

252
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,179
work less but that the jobs created in

253
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,579
the country have a very low added value

254
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,769
which generates very little and then of

255
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,420
course is due to structural problems

256
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,249
such as the inability to attract high

257
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,079
added value investments at lack of

258
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,730
competition a feeling of legal

259
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,829
insecurity a lack of entrepreneurship

260
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,350
infrastructure problems which are true

261
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,920
Ness cetera etc etc the surprised well

262
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,779
you shouldn't meet in fact it isn't the

263
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,999
only factor that has gotten worse this

264
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,679
is how Peru has evolved in the World

265
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,980
Competitiveness ranking

266
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,020
and this is important because one of

267
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,910
these secrets of the Asian economy is

268
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,680
that they began by specializing in

269
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,870
activities with little added value that

270
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,790
is so we can understand this better they

271
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,040
competed within low wages but at the

272
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,110
same time they always tried to improve

273
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,250
their level of competitiveness and you

274
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,140
can see this simply hasn't happened

275
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,940
improve this explains why traditional

276
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,000
exports the usual ones metals oils fish

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,550
milk represent more than 70% of all

278
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,560
Peruvian exports for example one of the

279
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,690
areas in which we can see the results of

280
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,610
this sluggishness is in education an

281
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,080
essential pillar for a country's

282
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,420
modernization

283
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,040
well after 25 years of strong economic

284
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,470
growth the peruvian education system it

285
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,150
continues to have more holes than a

286
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,950
wedge of swiss cheese according to the

287
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,930
IDB the inter-american Development Bank

288
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,090
only 30 percent of all educational

289
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,620
infrastructure can be considered

290
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,920
adequate anyway these are the main

291
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,720
problems that the country faces but just

292
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,820
hold on a second because Peru has done

293
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,160
many things well in recent years and we

294
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,110
can't end the video on such a negative

295
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,720
note so

296
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,310
[Music]

297
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,420
peddle progressive despite their

298
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,310
problems Peru has had one of the best

299
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,290
economic performances in Latin America

300
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,880
in the last three decades as we saw

301
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,649
earlier poverty levels dropped at full

302
00:12:52,649 --> 00:13:00,060
speed and that's very good news also

303
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,940
between 2011 and 2070 in the middle

304
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,620
class went from nine million eight

305
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,360
hundred and forty seven thousand people

306
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,000
to almost 13.5 million this is a growth

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,220
amount of 40 percent in just five years

308
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,230
and although it has slowed down the

309
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,180
country is still the fastest growing

[Music]

312
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,240
anyway with this video we wanted to

313
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,459
explain why Peru is having a harder time

314
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,980
than expected in making the big leap but

315
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,120
now it's your turn do you think Peru

316
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,740
will finally manage to emulate the

317
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,140
success of the Asian Dragons well leave
