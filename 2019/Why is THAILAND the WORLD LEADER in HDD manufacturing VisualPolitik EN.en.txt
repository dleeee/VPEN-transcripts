3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,490
Thailand is famous for tourism some of

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,740
the world's spiciest foods and also for

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,870
something you probably use every day but

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,090
didn't know that it was made there yes

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,070
we're talking about an essential part of

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,230
your computer something so important

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,390
that it makes Thailand a global news

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,509
story when things like this happen

11
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:29,769
Thailand's devastating floods are

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:32,140
hitting PC hard drive supplies more

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,260
analysts the Guardian 2011 this news

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,109
might be from 2011 but trust us things

15
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,239
haven't changed much Thailand is still a

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,430
huge production hub for electronics and

17
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,739
currently produces 40% of the world's

18
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:46,660
hard drives and that's surprising

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,250
because despite Thailand's growing

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,870
economy and great industrial

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,120
capabilities it's shockingly unstable

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,640
since the 1930s Thailand averages a coup

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,530
every four years it's a far cry from

24
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,239
democracy human rights are often

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,039
disrespected there's no freedom of

26
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,749
speech and insulting the monarchy can

27
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:03,519
land you in prison despite all of this

28
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,680
Thai people enjoy an income similar to

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,970
that of the Chinese there the

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,189
surprisingly egalitarian society with

31
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,960
virtually no unemployment and no

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,140
inflation

33
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,460
obviously they are not as rich as the

34
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,950
Swiss but they do much better than their

35
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,680
neighbors in Vietnam for example and no

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,420
in case you were wondering Thailand is

37
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,360
not oil rich or even gold rich nope this

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,010
is not a country that got rich on

39
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,660
natural resources at all that's why

40
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,369
today's question is how can such a

41
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,830
tumultuous and repressive country be

42
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,380
doing so well economically how did they

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,510
become such an important industrial

44
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,550
center well we're going to answer these

45
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,070
questions but before we do let's take a

46
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,770
look back at the history in the country

47
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,440
of the blind Taiwan a key is very easy

48
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,570
to study because basically you just have

49
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,700
to remember one name and then keep

50
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,009
counting the current king is King Rama

51
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,869
the tenth but before that there was King

52
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,830
Rama the ninth

53
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,350
his father was a you guessed it Rama the

54
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,360
eighth since this goes all the way back

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,100
to the first Rama and I know what you're

56
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,739
probably thinking ten generations island

57
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,570
in you just say that Thailand was

58
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,400
unstable how can that be if they've had

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,970
the same family ruling for the last 237

60
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,310
years well I think that Eric is going to

61
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,720
give us a bit more information about

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,630
that so the reality is that since 1932

63
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,260
Thailand had 12 successful and seven

64
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,660
failed attempted cooze

65
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,519
most of these were coos from different

66
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,010
factions of the army fighting with one

67
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,290
another and always respecting the place

68
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,450
of the monarch so yes they changed the

69
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,430
government but not the King never the

70
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,410
king and the government always keeps his

71
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,920
classical Thai flavor of military

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,299
authoritarianism however a little brutal

73
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:52,190
authoritarianism that's never storm to

74
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,590
the bastions of democracy from cozying

75
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,480
up to a country you see Thailand's

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,100
growth and development in Southeast Asia

77
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,290
has been brought about thanks to Western

78
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,010
investment

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,709
[Music]

80
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,450
just think about the United States in

81
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,670
the 1970s they needed a partner in the

82
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,980
region and now take a look at this map

83
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,799
from the era here we have Cambodia which

84
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,959
was essentially a communist hellscape

85
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,959
Vietnam was also communist and at war

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,629
allow is landlocked ins again communist

87
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,909
Indonesia was unstable and problematic

88
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,859
and then there was Burma which remained

89
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,359
one of the world's most isolated

90
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,969
countries until very recently basically

91
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,670
there was only one country the US could

92
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,950
partner with and out Thailand it helped

93
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,659
a lot the kings of Thailand's and their

94
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,040
military leaders have always been

95
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,650
fervently anti-communist and so Thailand

96
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,689
became a great natural ally for the

97
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,030
United States and Japan during the Cold

98
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,120
War

99
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,200
[Music]

100
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,159
but we're not only talking about

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,620
politics when it comes to economics

102
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,840
Thailand has a shocking advantage that

103
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,670
most people are unaware of their

104
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,040
currency is surprisingly stable yes the

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,109
BART the Thai currency is one of the

106
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,060
world's most stable currencies it was

107
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,849
pegged to the dollar up until the 1970s

108
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,289
and this is a great advantage for

109
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,239
investors because no matter what happens

110
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,220
the money you put there will always hold

111
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,169
its value this is much better than what

112
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,210
many other countries can offer and then

113
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,759
there is the tourism by 1967 Thailand

114
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,160
already received over 330 thousand

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,199
tourists a year mostly from countries

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,389
like Japan Australia and the United

117
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,009
States in other words they could get

118
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,750
away with a dodgy political system

119
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,460
because all of its neighbors were more

120
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,440
than happy to spend their money and time

121
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,300
down and this explains the enormous

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,250
investments that the United States made

123
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,870
in this country for example they built

124
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,030
an entire highway measuring five hundred

125
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,740
and ten kilometers that became the first

126
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,449
step for the Thai government to start

127
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,140
building infrastructure of its own

128
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,930
[Music]

129
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,970
thanks to this the country now has some

130
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,590
of the best infrastructure networks in

131
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,449
the region but make no mistake Highlands

132
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:03,729
bestfriends was not America it was Japan

133
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,979
back then Japan was starting to develop

134
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,229
their own international agenda this is

135
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,810
when the flying geese paradigm came up

136
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,940
basically Japan wanted to increase its

137
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,919
economic clout in the region so the

138
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:16,690
Japanese government began investing

139
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,280
alongside the private sector in

140
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,919
Southeast Asian countries and again in

141
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,199
that time Thailand was the best place in

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,550
which to put your money in a way

143
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,220
Thailand was to Japan what Mexico was to

144
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,930
the United States I know you might be

145
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,180
thinking right now well this is another

146
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,400
story of a poor country rolling out the

147
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,410
red carpet for international capitalism

148
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,110
right well actually not really in fact

149
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,070
the opposite is true

150
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,500
at that time Thailand's was incredibly

151
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,660
protectionist during the 1970s some

152
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,150
goods such as alcohol shoes and cars had

153
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,550
tariffs of up to 90% and price controls

154
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,289
became commonplace and regular goods

155
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,260
Thailand's it was just a cheap labor but

156
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,120
then in the 1980s something happened

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,550
some things that had a deep impact on

158
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,110
this country

162

a hard-driven economy the first personal

163
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,970
computers were launched in the 1970s but

164
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,610
the real IT boom started in the 1980s

165
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,830
all of a sudden every office worker had

166
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,380
his or her own personal computer people

167
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:33,210
also bought one to have at home and

168
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,889
which countries led this technological

169
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,870
revolution well of course it was the

170
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,419
United States and Japan companies like

171
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,759
the us's Atari or Japanese sharp

172
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,500
dominated the PC market in the early

173
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,509
days but they were not the only ones

174
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,699
soon Apple would start creating their

175
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,009
own models too and the race it was on to

176
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,900
come up with better and cheaper models

177
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,819
they had to cut costs by any means and

178
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,500
there was one components that didn't

179
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,330
require the highly skilled labor that

180
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,130
you need for making microchips and that

181
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,630
component is the hard drive so which

182
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,610
country would be the best candidate to

183
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,259
develop hard drive manufacturing

184
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,699
facilities well that would be a country

185
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,620
that had close ties to one of the main

186
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,599
PC producers the country that already

187
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,949
had good industry and good

188
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:19,050
infrastructure and yes obviously that

189
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,430
country was Thailand

190
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,650
this explains why sigue technology one

191
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,389
of the leading hard drive firms opens

196
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,020
up shop there during the 1980s after a

197
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,880
couple more coup d'etat Thailand slashed

198
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,740
most of their tariffs they opened up

199
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,840
parts of their international trade and

200
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,610
this incentivized many other companies

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,800
to follow Seagate's need draw the

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,300
network effect we've talked about it a

203
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,890
few times here on visual politic once

204
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,660
you have a critical mass of companies

205
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,280
from a certain industry you create a

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,590
network of suppliers universities and

207
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:59,950
specialization for example by 1992

208
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,260
Hitachi started operating in Thailand

209
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,080
and now has 40 subsidiaries and 16,000

210
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,820
employees in the country this means that

211
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,410
they can buy all of the supplies they

212
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,390

and you might now be wondering well is

224
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,390
this a lot of money well it works out to

225
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,170
about 2.6 percent of Thailand's GDP yep

226
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,240
2.6 percent of pylons GDP comes from

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,150
only producing hard disk drives now no

228
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,620
one can say for certain where the trend

229
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,420
is heading but it certainly doesn't seem

230
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,140

established network of technological

238
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,029

239
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,830
industries to set up in the country in

240
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,260
the 1960s Thailand already had contracts

you name any of the Thai companies no we

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,310
can't really blame you everything you

own that says Made in Thailand on it

258
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,820

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,310
Japanese South Korean or US company and

260
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,440

I mentioned earlier well they're not

265

just to think the past in fact their

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,780
most recent guitar one of these

267
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,730
successful ones happened as recently as

268
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,580
May of 2014 when the hunter took over

269
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,040
they will did the usual authoritarian

270
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,890
fists in this case it led to a new

271
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,890
constitution being adopted in 2017 this

272
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,510
came after a referendum that had

273
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,240
received a 59% yes vote so it might

274
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,560
sound like the people got what they

275
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,540
wanted versed well not really the

276
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,400
military had intimidated threatened and

277
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,170
arrested critics of the referendum and

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,550
Constitution along with political

279
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,890
activists that advocated voting it down

280
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,660
or abstaining from voting altogether

281
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,580
even legal opposition parties were

282
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,050
formally forbidden from campaigning

283
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,910
against it the new constitution is

284
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,710
generally considered something that was

285
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,240
forced through by the military to

286
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,070
increase their influence and power for

287
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,810
decades to come and the same goes with

288
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,480
elections in March of 2019 actual

289
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,130

as you can imagine the outcome Bozza

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,120

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,460

298
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,390
and had run the country under the recent

299
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,830
hunter basically the military hunter

300
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,720
managed to manipulate elections to get

301
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,250
itself elected in order to maintain

302
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,110
control now there is a silver lining

303
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,520
though there was still civilian

304
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,500
parliamentary elections in which a large

305
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,360

310
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,170

311
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,210
alleviate authoritarianism in the short

governments that were aware of this

322
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,649
however the Thai people are lucky in at

323
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,870
least two regards external factors are

them as companies flee US tariffs on

countries with similarly cheaper labor

334
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,060
Thailand's is one of those places these

00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,130
business with things like tax cards mean

338
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,750
that Thailand's will at very least

339
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,610
maintain its foreign investment on the

340
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,920
plus side who's another booming industry

341
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,140
in this country tourism

342
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,500
so how many tourists came to Thailand in

343
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,089
1967 is 330,000 now today it's over

344
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,430
thirty million tourists every year if

345
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,769
you thought that Thailand was overly

346
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:25,430
reliant and hard disk drives 2.6 percent

347
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,920
of GDP well keep in mind that tourism

348
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,700
makes up about 70% of GDP it doesn't

349
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,350
look like it's going down anytime soon

350
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,100
either

351
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,110
however Thailand is still just a bit

352
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,149
player on a global scale Thailand's

353
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,160
essentially an industrial park and a

occasional storm of power struggles

358
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,240
Thailand is still stuck in a cycle of

363
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,930
corporations that would keep all of the

364
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,149
profits in the country and this is the

365
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,649
price that you pay for having such an

366
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,269

367
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:09,980
arbitrary system if you want to have

368
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,200
your own entrepreneurs you need a higher

369
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,180
degree of freedom and stability

370
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,920
well now it's over to you do you think

371
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,690
Thailand will climb out of the middle

372
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,120
income trap and become a South Korea in

373
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,070
