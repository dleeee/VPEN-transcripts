5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,740
when you think of Japan what is the

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,590
first thing that comes to mind you might

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,690
think of a modern and advanced country

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,400
with a rich culture or sushi many will

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,230
also think of manga video games or

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,510
samurai basically you'll likely have a

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,340
very very positive image of the Land of

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,770
the Rising Sun however as you know all

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,750
countries have their positives and they

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,520
have their negatives therefore in this

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
video here on visual politic we're gonna

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,690
talk about a subject that very few media

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,539
outlets talk about and that's Japan's

18
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,360
historical revisionism

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:54,820
[Music]

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,920
what exactly does that mean see we could

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,170
say that revisionism is the denial of

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,299
historical events usually negative of

23
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,100
course that happens in the past

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,540
so let's see what kind of people these

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,899
Japanese really are many countries that

26
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,630
have hard to digest past strive to hide

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,939
the truth or try and change the official

28
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:19,220
version of events and Japan definitely

29
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,170
one of them let's turn this around a bit

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,940
when we think of Japan in its history

31
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,009
what comes to mind probably samurai

32
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,080
geishas perhaps the double nuclear

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,850
attacker in the United States ought the

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,649
Pearl Harbor attack well at least

35
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,600
because of a movie to us knowing about

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,830
these events is normal but folks do we

37
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,140
really know how the Japanese Empire was

38
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,729
at the height of its power do you know

39
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,220
exactly what this means for the Far East

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,200
why do you think that the countries that

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,600
Japan victimized such as China and Korea

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,689
still are very susceptible to this issue

43
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,910
well listen up

44
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:02,070
[Music]

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,650
the Japanese Empire the Empire of Terror

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,240
you heard that right

47
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
during the first half of the 20th

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
century and especially during the 30s

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,820
and 40s Japan was an imperialist power

50
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,830
that dedicated itself to invading its

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,780
neighbors as if there was no tomorrow

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,390
and they did so with no hints of mercy

53
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,490
and when we say without mercy we mean it

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,550
they were truly inhumane throughout

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,080
those years Japanese troops committed

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,000
some of the most heinous abuses to human

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
integrity life and identity that could

58
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,410
ever be imagined so almost all of the

59
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,760
worst things we could imagine a country

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,740
doing Japan did we're talking about

61
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,080
terrible things like enslaving people to

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,450
work in Japan's industries and mining

63
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,550
enslaving women to work in brothels and

64
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,080
on the war fronts not to mention from

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,330
the unit 731 squad experiments in which

66
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,739
they used living people to conduct

67
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,600
chemical weapon experiments in the

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,850
Chinese city of Nanjing alone in barely

69
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,550
two months the Japanese killed 300,000

70
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,310
people and abused more than 80,000 women

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,110
it's truly a shocking history

72
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,210
Munson invaded a country the Japanese

73
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,400
Empire forcibly imposed its culture its

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,170
language and Japan's political and legal

75
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,420
system it even forced people to change

76
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,200
their names as you can see we're talking

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,480
about a dark era of uncontrolled and

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,240
unlimited fear atrocities and violence

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
the soldiers and the officers they could

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,690
do as they wished as a result of all of

81
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,240
this at least twenty million people in

82
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,010
Asia lost their lives at the hands of

83
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:43,400
the Japanese Empire 20 million people in

84
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,470
fact the data on the Japanese Army's

85
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,450
lack of scruples during the war give you

86
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,700
goosebumps check this out 40 percent of

87
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,380
American prisoners of war who fell into

88
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,240
the hands of the Japanese didn't survive

89
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,240
40 percent to give you an idea that

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,700
number in Europe less than 2%

91
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,870
and don't think that this was a

92
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,090
coincidence not at all the explanation

93
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,099
lies in the ancient Japanese culture

94
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,620
known as Bushido a culture that despises

95
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,569
soldiers who surrender in combat this

96
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,790
also explains why the Japanese soldiers

97
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,739
were so famous for fighting until the

98
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:23,910
very end but having said that let's

99
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:32,610
close the history book since Prime

100
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,470
Minister Shinzo Abe's rise to power in

101
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,960
2012 Japan has surprised the world with

102
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,270
a revision and denial policy of its

103
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,340
history that is truly disturbing but

104
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,200
what does it consist of what is Shinzo

105
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,270
are they doing to change or sugarcoat

106
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,400
the story our today's Japanese really

107
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:55,270
aware of their past well listen up

108
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,400
Shinzo Abe a revisionism in the

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,490
institutions Shinzo Abe a is already a

110
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,710
well-known face members of Congress I

111
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,719
have the high privilege and the distinct

112
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,369
honor of presenting to you his

113
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:08,479
Excellency

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,599
Shinzo Abe a prime minister of Japan

115
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,819
he's been running Japan since 2012 and

116
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,529
his famous particularly because of his

117
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,899
economic policy program better known as

118
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:28,430
abenomics back in June 1957 nobusuke

119
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,569
Kishi my grandfather standing right here

120
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,990
as Prime Minister of Japan now there is

121
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,639
a much more controversial aspect to

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,710
Shinzo Abe a that isn't mentioned much

123
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,680
in the West Lobby is an openly convinced

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,449
revisionist and the truth is that he's

125
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,080
always been one

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,150
[Music]

127
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,250
since he first entered the diet Oh

128
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,890
Japan's Parliament in 1993 Albert has

129
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,900
promoted laws and reforms that seek to

130
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,790
sugarcoat how the history of the

131
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,220
Japanese Empire is shown to society for

132
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,380
example in his first and brief term as

133
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,480
Prime Minister between September 2006

134
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,090
and September 2007 pavÃ© approved a

135
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,280
fundamental law of education reform to

136
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,440
establish a more patriotic vision with

137
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,600
more traditionalist moral values in the

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,820
Japanese education system that is pure

139
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,560
nationalism in the education system and

140
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,330
not just that Shinzo Abe a himself as a

141
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,310
member of the Nippon Chi gear Japanese

142
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,950
ultra nationalist group founded in 1997

143
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,690
that openly defends historical

144
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,880
revisionism to exculpate of the Japanese

145
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,980
Empire from its crimes basically it's

146
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,900
kind of like if Angela Merkel belong to

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,610
an ultra radical far-right group in

148
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,980
Germany wouldn't really be cool but do

149
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,480
you think are they hides his enrollments

150
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,110
not at all u.s. textbook skews history

151
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,620
Prime Minister of Japan says

152
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,170
in fact guys Prime Minister are they not

153
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,820
only modifying the Japanese education

154
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,130
laws to change education of contest but

155
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,680
openly criticizes how Japan's history is

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,450
addressed in other countries basically

157
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,840
he makes no effort to conceal his bias

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,480
arby's revisionism net own goals at home

159
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,180
and away the Japanese Prime Minister

160
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,490
even attacked the mcgraw-hill publishing

161
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,290
house for the description that they made

162
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,210
of how Japan forced women to prostitute

163
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,860
themselves on the war front women who

164
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,600
for him and the revisionists were

165
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,400
nothing more than volunteers who earned

166
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,440
a lot of money although all historical

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,240
evidence does show that they were slaves

168
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,870
I just looked at a document McGraw

169
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,970
Hill's textbook and I was shocked this

170
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,310
kind of textbook is being used in the

171
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,410
United States and we did not protest the

172
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,180
things we should have or we failed to

173
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,820
correct the things we should have Shinzo

174
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,430
Abe a japan's Prime Minister and this

175
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,860
wasn't an isolated case obeys Japan

176
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,050
began when he started implementing the

177
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,820
most extreme revisionism in the

178
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,860
institution's driven by the ultra

179
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,070
nationalist group Nippon ke

180
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,570
[Music]

181
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,010
in his speech during the 70th

182
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,510
anniversary of Japan's surrender

183
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,460
are they citing the three million who

184
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,470
died in the Japanese Empire extolled

185
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,450
their sacrifices and called them

186
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,460
valuable had very same event by the way

187
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,070
the then Emperor Akihito also spoke he

188
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,900
of course is Hirohito son the Emperor

189
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,670
who attacked Pearl Harbor and unleashed

190
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,890
many wars across Asia well in contrast

191
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,960
to Shinzo are they Akito is somewhat

192
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,610
more embarrassed by his country's

193
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,640
revisionist inclination our country

194
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,190
today enjoys peace and prosperity thanks

195
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,080
to the ceaseless efforts made by the

196
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,510
people of Japan toward recovery from the

197
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,490
devastation of war and toward

198
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,229
development always backed by their

199
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,630
earnest desire for the continuation of

200
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:46,740
peace Emperor Akihito is curious that

201
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,330
the Emperor himself has a much more

202
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,190
conciliatory speech than the Prime

203
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,630
Minister regarding the Empire's past

204
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,690
[Music]

205
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,900
and there is more both Shinzo Abe a and

206
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,720
many of his party's ministers deputies

207
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,030
and senators regularly visit or send

208
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,040
offerings to that Yasukuni Shrine

209
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,930
yes Cooney folks is a Shinto shrine

210
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,180
where 14 class-a war criminals from the

211
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,520
Japanese Anbar among others are on it

212
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,620
war criminals that were declared as such

213
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,210
in the Tokyo trials the Japanese

214
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,950
equivalent to the Nuremberg trials for

215
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,170
the Nazis busts if you think this is all

216
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,840
a matter of speeches words and visits to

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,960
controversial places well you're very

218
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,310
very mistaken I'll listen up

219
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,830
[Music]

220
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,660
the dream of controlling education

221
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,490
that's right it's no secret every ruler

222
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,230
who aspires to change history for better

223
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,180
or for worse needs to influence

224
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,070
education we already mentioned that are

225
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,870
they modifying the educational law for

226
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,760
this purpose but he did not stop there

227
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,589
one of his government's biggest scandals

228
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,110
was that of the Asaka more atomic gakuen

229
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,480
nursery school you see this is a private

230
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
kindergarten school which has an

231
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,350
ultra-nationalist ideology yep a nursery

232
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,660
school with an ultra-nationalist

233
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,070
ideology it indoctrinates children in

234
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,410
the purest Japanese and past all they

235
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,180
even made them memorize the so-called

236
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,149
Imperial rescript on education of 1890

237
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:21,519
every day a kind of manifesto with the

238
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,320
Empire's principles all four kids who

239
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,730
were five and six years old

240
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,230
hold on a second what Russians are they

241
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:32,410
have to do with any of this well in

242
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,880
addition to publicly stating that he

243
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,950
shared the vision of the director ABBA

244
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,690
and his wife who by the way was named

245
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,370
honorary director of the nursery were

246
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,440
immersed in a donations and favoritism

247
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,750
scandal where public land was sold to

248
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,310
benefit the nursery the corruption

249
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,320
scandal almost brought down our Bay's

250
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,970
governments although he managed to

251
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,680
remain standing in the ends but besides

252
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,810
the imperialist nursery scandal there's

253
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,370
a kind of historical whitewash

254
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,649
throughout Japan's entire educational

255
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,380
system history teacher Tamaki Matsuoka

256
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,570
famous for having gotten 250 former

257
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,190
soldiers from the time of the Japanese

258
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,050
Empire to admit to multiple war crimes

259
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,209
is an expert in analyzing out Japan's

260
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:12,100
past is tackled in modern schools

261
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Matsuoka accuses the government of

262
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,060
deliberately silencing the most negative

263
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,410
historical events of the Japanese Empire

264
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,670
for example in the textbooks that

265
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,500
students use in schools only one

266
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,240
footnote is dedicated to the Nanking

267
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,829
Massacre which we talked about at the

268
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,329
beginning of this video and you know I

269
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:30,070
would kind of think that an event with

270
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,160
300 thousand victims is probably enough

271
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,720
for a bit of a proper placement in a

272
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,260
history book

273
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,670
wouldn't you think but the fact that

274
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,800
this is happening raises an essential

275
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,149
question what effects could this

276
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,710
historical silencing have

277
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:45,949
[Music]

278
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:47,720
guys even though here on visual politic

279
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,579
we don't really like looking too far

280
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:51,889
back ignoring such an important part of

281
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,749
history can be dangerous when making

282
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:55,730
political decisions especially in a

283
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,379
region of the world that has so many

284
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,449
national feelings to make matters worse

285
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,429
movies books and series that the

286
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,529
Japanese government itself promotes feed

287
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,929
this idea of changing people's vision of

288
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,199
the past I'm referring to work such as

289
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,329
the eternal zero a film that highlights

290
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:13,519
the importance of the kamikaze pilots

291
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,470
this growing nationalism along with the

292
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,540
political and commercial confrontations

293
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,220
that have been registered in this area

294
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,929
of the world help explain the growing

295
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,669
suspicion with which young Japanese

296
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:24,319
people have begun looking of their

297
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,209
neighbors sociological studies state

298
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,189
that today 80 percent of Japanese people

299
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:30,019
have a bad image of China and sixty

300
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,730
percent of South Korea and that's

301
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,389
obviously not a good thing it's often

302
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:36,439
doing all of this what do you think

303
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,569
about how Japan is dealing with its past

304
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,549
do you think it could have consequences

305
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,799
maybe Japan should learn from Germany

306
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,600
about facing up to its history well
