Argentina to go on and become the

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,629
on Argentina's future you see at the

86
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:30,670
beginning of the 20th century Argentina

87
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,709
was also something of a beacon in Latin

growing rapidly education system was

92
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,590
highly advanced and the country held a

93
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,230
large share in the global capital market

94
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,669
on some examples well in those years

95
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,650
Argentina is one of the main recipients

96
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,569
of direct European investments it was

97
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,129
one of the largest primary goods

98
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,959

99
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,879
most popular destination for immigrants

100
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,919
from the old continent yes at this time

101
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,139
German spaniards and italians migrated

102
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,340
on masse to argentina in other words

103
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,989
we're talking about a country that saw

104
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,090
the united states as its equal that

105
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,859
explains why at the time when US aires

106
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:13,239
was on the list with the london new york

107
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:15,310
or any other major city in the world and

108
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,019
on top of that it managed to stay after

109
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,519
the second world war saving many lives

110
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,560
and many dollars so don't tell me you

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
would have a better large antenna about

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,860
my last scent you would hold on just a

113
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,990
second because things soon began to

114
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:32,710
change take a look at this chart at the

115
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,580
beginning of the 20th century

116
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,250
Argentina's GDP per capita was three

117
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,020
times higher than that of Japan this gap

118
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,849
remained until the end of the Second

119
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,680
World War however from the 50s onwards

120
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
there was a significant change suddenly

121
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,550
Japan began catching up at full speed so

122
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,590
much so that by the end of the 1960's

123
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,210
the Land of the Rising Sun had already

124
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,280
surpassed Argentina since then the gap

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,720
has only increased

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,919
let's go back to the main question at

192
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,690
what point did Argentina and Japan begin

193
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,340
to take such a difference in divergent

194
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,370
paths you see after the Second World War

195
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,229
Japan in one way or another began to

196
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,090
slowly assimilate and copy many of the

197
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,949
elements that had made the United States

198
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,700
prosper

199
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,770
this had a lot to do with the u.s.

200
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,450
occupation under the command of General

201
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,160
Douglas MacArthur leader of the supreme

202
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,630
command of the Allied forces these

203
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,490
occupation forces aims to demilitarize

204
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,340
and democratize Japanese society to do

205
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,020
so the Constitution was rewritten and

206
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,490
many of the us's institutions were

207
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,050
copied such as the elimination of the

208
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,820
power and of the government size the

209
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,530
protection of private property and the

210
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,630
freedom of business commerce in short

211
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,960
Japan opened itself up to the world

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,580
meanwhile Argentina did the opposite in

213
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,860
February 1946 juan domingo perón became

214
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,740
the country's president with him came a

215
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,900
real model change for the South American

216
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,460
country suddenly the state began to

217
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,350
increase its size and its influence on

218
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,030
the economy and small aspects of

219
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,950
Argentinian society a lot of countries

220
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,420
were nationalized especially those

221
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,250
dedicated transport energy in

222
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,810
communications tons of the government's

223
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,340
controlled and a lot of restrictions on

224
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,320
foreign trade were approved in addition

225
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,000
there were a lot of regulations of all

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,500
kinds in practice parent transformed

227
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,110
Argentina into a kind of army rules by

228
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,980
the orders of its presidents

229
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,650
[Music]

230
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,630
[Applause]

231
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,639
to carry out his plans the liberal

232
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,220
constitution of 1853 was replaced by a

233
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,769
paradise one in 1949 in the first 10

234
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,120
years of perón's leadership that

235
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,740
government distortions of the state's

236
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,529
economic activity was so great that

237
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:21,970
Argentinians eventually had to eat black

238
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,069
bread and ration their meat consumption

239
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:28,360
this is not because of a vegan VAD or

240
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,069
anything like that but because of

241
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,410
scarcity Argentinian producers opted to

242
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,180
stop producing rather than comply with

243
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,130
the price controls or the exchange rates

244
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,590
that were established by the government

245
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,680
[Music]

246
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,000
and on top of all of that prawns exit

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,410
from power didn't really cause any

248
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,780
change yes some economic freedoms were

249
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,400
reintroduced and some controls were

250
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,440
suppressed but the states wait its size

251
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,000
and its interference in the country's

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
economic activity did not received

253
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,480
public spending high taxes and inflation

254
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,290
had come to stay

255
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,900
[Music]

256
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,550
folks the changes prompt set in motion

257
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,010
in Argentina became definitive and to

258
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,060
this we understand the political

259
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,190
instability caused by eight secession of

260
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,380
military coos these are a crisis that

261
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,600
happens in Argentina over and over again

262
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,860
every five to ten years the results as

263
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,660
you all know is that today Argentina is

264
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,070
no longer one of the ten richest

265
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,450
countries in the world it's not even in

266
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,930
the top 25 it's not even in the top 50

267
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,220
according to data from the International

268
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,870
Monetary Fund's and taking price

269
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,730
differences into accounts in purchasing

270
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,520
power parity terms Argentina ranks 62nd

271
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,960
and the countries with the highest GDP

272
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,520
per capita that is it's at the same

273
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,650
level as countries like Iran Belarus or

274
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,010
Gabon

275
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,830
[Music]

276
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,080
and everything indicates that after the

277
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,180
last crisis it's gonna fall even further

278
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,640
down the list today 32% of Argentinians

279
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,830
that's one in three live in poverty

280
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,900
Argentina is one of the few countries in

281
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,400
the world where poverty is increasing

282
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,730
instead of decreasing anyway folks

283
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,680
that's how Japan and Argentina revolved

284
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,180
in several videos on this channel we've

285
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,010
seen in detail how Argentina and Japan

286
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,930
became what they are today but now the

287
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,270
question is can we extract some key

288
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,700
points from comparing these two well I

289
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,580
believe we can check this out

290
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,730
[Music]

291
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,590
the key points let's see by comparing

292
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,630
Argentina and Japan we can extract three

293
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,580
main ideas that I think we should always

294
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,440
take into account the first and let's

295
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,790
make this really clear is it a country

296
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,380
isn't rich or poor because of its

297
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,210
natural resources or its size it's

298
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,470
useless to have huge amounts of

299
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,790
resources if they aren't properly

300
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,650
exploited in fact Japan proves that a

301
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,330
country can be very rich without having

302
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,990
natural resources or a lot of territory

303
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,210
[Music]

304
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,490
what matters folks what really makes a

305
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,410
difference in wealth generation is a

306
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,690
country's level of capital investment

307
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,700
and work innovation and productivity are

308
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,500
much much more important than Natural

309
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,240
Resources the second idea is that a

310
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
country that reaches a high level of

311
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,600
development and prosperity is not

312
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,029
guaranteed to sustain that level

313
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,220
indefinitely

314
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,170
well that doesn't exist per se it has to

315
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,089
be created continually and its creation

316
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,700
needs to adapt to the changes that occur

317
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,500
in the world otherwise you could have a

318
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,330
similar experience to Argentina which

319
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,250
went from being the richest country on

320
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,709
earth to 60 second place and falling of

321
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,600
course such a decline in fortune is bad

322
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,279
for everyone especially for the most

323
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,870
disadvantaged members of the population

324
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,060
punishing a productive economy is always

325
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,770
a bad idea the third idea is that wealth

326
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,450
isn't achieved by government spending

327
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,700
like crazy public spending can only be

328
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,529
financed through three methods more

329
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:52,720
taxes more public debt or running the

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,089
bill printing machine that is increasing

331
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:56,860
inflation all three methods cause

332
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,020
nothing but crisis and poverty you have

333
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,000
to be very clear about where public

334
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
spending will end if you want a country

335
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,600
to prosper and if you don't believe me

336
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,190
you can see another good example of this

337
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,959
in Venezuela anyway folks this was a

338
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,700
comparison comparing how Argentina and

339
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,110
Japan evolved into what we can learn

340
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,459
