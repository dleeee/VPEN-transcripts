3
00:00:06.95 --> 00:00:12.599
is the world getting better or worse is

4
00:00:09.96 --> 00:00:13.530
globalization good or bad is the way we

5
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.190
relate to each other

6
00:00:13.53 --> 00:00:19.140
changing these team like simple

7
00:00:17.19 --> 00:00:21.390
questions but their answers conceal very

8
00:00:19.14 --> 00:00:23.279
divergent ways by which we understand

9
00:00:21.39 --> 00:00:25.080
the world for those who regularly follow

10
00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.480
this channel I'm convinced that you know

11
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:29.519
that we are quite optimistic here about

12
00:00:27.48 --> 00:00:31.140
our planet in general here at visual

13
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.149
politic we are convinced and the

14
00:00:31.14 --> 00:00:34.320
analytical data seems to corroborate is

15
00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.300
that we live in a world that is

16
00:00:34.32 --> 00:00:38.430
improving and will be better in the

17
00:00:36.3 --> 00:00:41.520
future

18
00:00:38.43 --> 00:00:41.520
[Music]

19
00:00:43.27 --> 00:00:47.290
however that does not mean that there

20
00:00:45.16 --> 00:00:49.810
are no problems I mean obviously there

21
00:00:47.29 --> 00:00:52.090
are and some of these are as serious as

22
00:00:49.81 --> 00:00:54.250
this we are facing the largest

23
00:00:52.09 --> 00:00:57.160
humanitarian crisis since the creation

24
00:00:54.25 --> 00:00:58.900
of the United Nations in 1945 now more

25
00:00:57.16 --> 00:01:01.300
than 20 million people across four

26
00:00:58.9 --> 00:01:03.550
countries face starvation and famine yes

27
00:01:01.3 --> 00:01:06.580
of course there are still many problems

28
00:01:03.55 --> 00:01:08.920
on this planet well with in recent years

29
00:01:06.58 --> 00:01:11.320
globalization has become in most cases

30
00:01:08.92 --> 00:01:13.330
the culprit of everything and the

31
00:01:11.32 --> 00:01:16.340
scapegoat for all of our sins

32
00:01:13.33 --> 00:01:18.390
[Music]

33
00:01:16.34 --> 00:01:20.310
unemployment's relocation poverty

34
00:01:18.39 --> 00:01:22.530
inequality for many people these are the

35
00:01:20.31 --> 00:01:24.299
consequences of a process of global

36
00:01:22.53 --> 00:01:26.310
integration which more and more people

37
00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.229
think has gone too far the numbers are

38
00:01:26.31 --> 00:01:30.000
quite clear every time a survey is done

39
00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.920
most people think that the world is

40
00:01:30.0 --> 00:01:35.490
getting worse and this is happening in a

41
00:01:31.92 --> 00:01:37.770
way because of globalization on an

42
00:01:35.49 --> 00:01:39.420
example well in 2016 a study was

43
00:01:37.77 --> 00:01:41.579
published in The Economist that found

44
00:01:39.42 --> 00:01:43.320
that less than half of Americans Brits

45
00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.459
and the French leaved that this whole

46
00:01:43.32 --> 00:01:49.170
process was a good thing and as we have

47
00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.270
seen here a visual politic all this

48
00:01:49.17 --> 00:01:53.580
growing unpopularity of globalization

49
00:01:51.27 --> 00:01:56.310
has been exploited in practically every

50
00:01:53.58 --> 00:02:00.090
corner of the world by all kinds of

51
00:01:56.31 --> 00:02:02.250
politicians these are politicians who

52
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:04.649
oppose immigration who oppose free trade

53
00:02:02.25 --> 00:02:06.149
and oppose ultimately well everything

54
00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.160
that's different however on this

55
00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.319
occasion it is not a matter of political

56
00:02:08.16 --> 00:02:12.540
color in both right-wing parties and

57
00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.670
left-wing parties we find this type of

58
00:02:12.54 --> 00:02:16.530
discourse perhaps a good example was the

59
00:02:14.67 --> 00:02:17.940
elections in the United States where we

60
00:02:16.53 --> 00:02:20.070
saw how both Donald Trump and the

61
00:02:17.94 --> 00:02:22.079
Democratic primary candidate Bernie

62
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:24.120
Sanders defended in one way or another

63
00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.590
this sort of speech which can be

64
00:02:24.12 --> 00:02:28.890
summarized in a sentence as

65
00:02:25.59 --> 00:02:32.700
globalization is destroying our society

66
00:02:28.89 --> 00:02:37.430
it used to be cars were made in Flint

67
00:02:32.7 --> 00:02:42.870
and you couldn't drink the water in

68
00:02:37.43 --> 00:02:48.709
Mexico now cars are made in Mexico and

69
00:02:42.87 --> 00:02:55.590
you can't drink the water in Flint since

70
00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:59.459
2001 we have seen over 50,000 factories

71
00:02:55.59 --> 00:03:03.239
in America shut down millions of workers

72
00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.299
right millions of workers have lost

73
00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.760
decent paying jobs but then America

74
00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.130
changed his policy from promoting

75
00:03:08.76 --> 00:03:17.030
development in America in in in America

76
00:03:13.13 --> 00:03:20.030
to promoting development in other

77
00:03:17.03 --> 00:03:20.030
nations

78
00:03:21.67 --> 00:03:26.080
[Applause]

79
00:03:24.01 --> 00:03:27.459
together with political movements that

80
00:03:26.08 --> 00:03:28.090
in recent years have spread like

81
00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.040
wildfire

82
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:32.230
ARIMA has emerged a widespread

83
00:03:30.04 --> 00:03:34.930
perception that says that globalization

84
00:03:32.23 --> 00:03:37.000
is stopping so did you I think the

85
00:03:34.93 --> 00:03:38.829
question we have to answer here is this

86
00:03:37.0 --> 00:03:41.349
what is really happening with

87
00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.980
globalization are we facing a paradigm

88
00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.459
change well let's have a look

89
00:03:42.98 --> 00:03:52.469
[Music]

90
00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.329
the break for the last seven decades

91
00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.819
since the Second World War

92
00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.829
globalization has accelerated constantly

93
00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.319
and with it the movement of people goods

94
00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:06.269
and capital all over the world through

95
00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.519
all these years many political barriers

96
00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.109
to trade have been eliminators for a

97
00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.939
company to have factories or sell

98
00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.799
products in a country produced thousands

99
00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.810
of kilometers away well it's become

100
00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.609
totally normal suddenly wherever you

101
00:04:15.81 --> 00:04:19.139
live eating sushi pizza and nachos with

102
00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.239
guacamole or even drinking a Heineken

103
00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:28.590
has become the most normal thing in the

104
00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:31.280
world almost a tradition in itself yeah

105
00:04:28.59 --> 00:04:31.280
maybe honey

106
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:37.169
there were even those who predicted that

107
00:04:35.22 --> 00:04:38.970
national borders would become a thing of

108
00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.650
the past however perhaps the culminating

109
00:04:38.97 --> 00:04:43.410
moment of all this culture occurred in

110
00:04:40.65 --> 00:04:45.210
December of 2001 when China joined the

111
00:04:43.41 --> 00:04:47.250
World Trade Organization

112
00:04:45.21 --> 00:04:48.660
that is when China really integrated

113
00:04:47.25 --> 00:04:50.220
into the world economy and became

114
00:04:48.66 --> 00:04:52.139
something of a factory to the world

115
00:04:50.22 --> 00:04:56.150
however with the financial crisis

116
00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:59.669
suddenly things they started to change

117
00:04:56.15 --> 00:05:01.650
according to data between 2011 and 2015

118
00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.690
the value of the world's exports

119
00:05:01.65 --> 00:05:05.760
plummeted by 10 percent this is

120
00:05:03.69 --> 00:05:07.710
according to the WTO and not only that

121
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:09.990
according to McKinsey the annual capital

122
00:05:07.71 --> 00:05:11.880
movements this is stocks bonds foreign

123
00:05:09.99 --> 00:05:17.330
investments or loans collapsed more than

124
00:05:11.88 --> 00:05:17.330
60 percent between 2007 and 2015

125
00:05:19.54 --> 00:05:23.410
in addition the crisis and all those

126
00:05:21.67 --> 00:05:25.810
politicians who consider that trade is a

127
00:05:23.41 --> 00:05:28.090
zero-sum game where some win and others

128
00:05:25.81 --> 00:05:29.920
always lose have resulted in recent

129
00:05:28.09 --> 00:05:32.050
years in protectionist regulations

130
00:05:29.92 --> 00:05:35.800
becoming fashionable once again from

131
00:05:32.05 --> 00:05:39.850
this day forward a new vision will

132
00:05:35.8 --> 00:05:45.540
govern our land from this day forward

133
00:05:39.85 --> 00:05:49.320
it's going to be only America first

134
00:05:45.54 --> 00:05:49.320
America first

135
00:05:49.47 --> 00:05:53.880
business leaders are scrambling to

136
00:05:51.48 --> 00:05:55.770
adjust to world few imagine possible

137
00:05:53.88 --> 00:05:57.840
just a year ago the myth of a borderless

138
00:05:55.77 --> 00:06:00.300
world has come crashing down Pankaj

139
00:05:57.84 --> 00:06:01.920
Ghemawat according to the global trade

140
00:06:00.3 --> 00:06:03.330
alert a panel that monitors how

141
00:06:01.92 --> 00:06:06.570
government's take measures that affect

142
00:06:03.33 --> 00:06:08.700
trade since 2008 more than 8000

143
00:06:06.57 --> 00:06:11.120
protectionist regulations have been put

144
00:06:08.7 --> 00:06:11.120
into place

145
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.069
well wait just a moment it because

146
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.749
although it does seem true that in

147
00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:24.449
recent years international trade has

148
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:24.449
lost strength this is not entirely true

149
00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.560
it's not true for two main reasons

150
00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.840
first instead of seeing what has

151
00:06:29.56 --> 00:06:33.819
happened since the crisis let's take a

152
00:06:31.84 --> 00:06:36.219
slightly longer period of time for

153
00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.990
example since the year 2000 if we look

154
00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.229
at what is happening in the 21st century

155
00:06:37.99 --> 00:06:45.249
it so happens that both trade and

156
00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:48.159
investments have grown a lot and seconds

157
00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:50.680
well you know what in 2017 globalization

158
00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.879
is returning with strength that's right

159
00:06:50.68 --> 00:06:54.039
in recent years there has been a

160
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:55.779
revolution that not even Donald Trump or

161
00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.909
Vladimir Putin has been able to put a

162
00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:01.680
stop to a revolution that will make our

163
00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.680
world look a whole lot smaller

164
00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:12.719
but digital globalization well trade has

165
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.789
been around for a number of years but

166
00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.669
now international data traffic has

167
00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:20.039
exploded in the United States alone 80

168
00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.830
terabytes of data enter and leave the

169
00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.779
country every minute a gigantic number

170
00:07:22.83 --> 00:07:26.459
that is 8 times the content of the

171
00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.889
Library of Congress of the United States

172

important to the economy than the trade

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:45.149
of goods for example Facebook has just

179
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:47.159
exceeded the 2 billion active users mark

183
00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:56.969
truth is that the business they generate

00:09:13.56 --> 00:09:17.550
well the fact is that if we consider all

208
00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:19.139
this it turns out that the global

209

than in 2007 just before the outbreak of

the great global crisis the truth is

213
00:09:26.37 --> 00:09:30.569
that each day that passes brings us into

indeed it's only going to grow in fact

we'd now like to pose a question is it

possible that despite politicians like

220

Donald Trump we are at the door of a new

asked us how we see the future of

227

respond negatively as we've seen in this

strengthen its commercial commitment in

00:11:20.01 --> 00:11:23.250
fact it is demanding that the World

market economy

260
00:11:24.62 --> 00:11:30.300
you see when in 2001 trying to join the

261
00:11:27.6 --> 00:11:32.220
WTO it did so under its economic status

262
00:11:30.3 --> 00:11:34.470
not market status and it was agreed that

263
00:11:32.22 --> 00:11:40.620
15 years later this condition would be

264
00:11:34.47 --> 00:11:42.510
reviewed now that time has come we're

265
00:11:40.62 --> 00:11:44.580
talking about a technicality that allows

266
00:11:42.51 --> 00:11:46.710
the rest of the WTO countries such as

267
00:11:44.58 --> 00:11:48.900

268
00:11:46.71 --> 00:11:52.770
impose protectionist measures in their

269
00:11:48.9 --> 00:11:54.660
relations with China for example

270
00:11:52.77 --> 00:11:56.580
anti-dumping measures or to restrict

purpose and is recognized as a full

00:12:00.66 --> 00:12:03.750

00:12:02.46 --> 00:12:05.760
that will happen eventually

we will see how its commercial relations

with the rest of the world are going to

278

have another important upturn

00:12:11.57 --> 00:12:16.260
it is true that people listen to a lot
