1
00:00:00.0 --> 00:00:06.109
it's the second most populated country

2
00:00:01.86 --> 00:00:09.120
on earth as the seventh biggest economy

3
00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.769
as one of the ten biggest military

budgets in the world and is a nuclear

5
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.730
power however India is a stranger in

6
00:00:18.0 --> 00:00:22.410
political town if I was asked you where

7
00:00:20.73 --> 00:00:27.599
is the Prime Minister of India couldn't

8
00:00:22.41 --> 00:00:29.580
tell me now I am aware that many of you

9
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.529
will actually know this especially if

10
00:00:29.58 --> 00:00:33.180
you're watching this video from India

11
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.950
but if you don't know who the Prime

12
00:00:33.18 --> 00:00:38.180
Minister of India is don't worry because

13
00:00:34.95 --> 00:00:38.180
well that happens a lot

14
00:00:43.62 --> 00:00:49.149
on the 26th of May 2014 after an

15
00:00:47.5 --> 00:00:51.640
absolute majority which had not been

16
00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.559
seen in 30 years Narendra Modi it became

17
00:00:51.64 --> 00:00:55.799
the Prime Minister of India Modi's

18
00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.420
mission well it was clear boost growth

19
00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.969
investment and create millions of jobs

20
00:00:58.42 --> 00:01:02.739
in conclusion turn India into a

21
00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.199
superpower capable of competing with

22
00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.119
China on an economic political and

23
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.220
military level Jim Kim has had

24
00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.680
productivity excellence Emily's some a

25
00:01:09.22 --> 00:01:13.899
symbol for their product now India gives

26
00:01:11.68 --> 00:01:16.720
your politic viewers is something of an

27
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.729
eternal promise it's always that country

28
00:01:16.72 --> 00:01:20.590
that seems to be the next one that's

29
00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.720
going to take off but it never really

30
00:01:20.59 --> 00:01:24.549
done we can see that this is definitely

31
00:01:22.72 --> 00:01:27.130
the case if we take a look at India's

32
00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.950
GDP and compare it to that of China

33
00:01:27.13 --> 00:01:30.950
[Music]

34
00:01:32.67 --> 00:01:36.750
they've seen quite different economic

35
00:01:35.01 --> 00:01:39.000
development in the last few decades

36
00:01:36.75 --> 00:01:41.010
so with Modi's victory expectations are

37
00:01:39.0 --> 00:01:42.869
once again high-end India has again

38
00:01:41.01 --> 00:01:44.880
become the talk of the town Modi is

39
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.610
repeating over and over again that the

40
00:01:44.88 --> 00:01:49.560
21st century is going to be India's

41
00:01:47.61 --> 00:01:52.910
century well before we get into all of

42
00:01:49.56 --> 00:01:57.119
that let's take a look at Modi himself

43
00:01:52.91 --> 00:01:59.670
Luiz Narendra Modi's vegetarian single

44
00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.100
and a yoga enthusiast Modi escapes the

45
00:01:59.67 --> 00:02:03.810
traditional politician profile he comes

46
00:02:02.1 --> 00:02:05.220
from a family of limited means and when

47
00:02:03.81 --> 00:02:07.560
he was a child used to help his father

48
00:02:05.22 --> 00:02:09.030
sell tea in a train station this has

49
00:02:07.56 --> 00:02:11.370
helped him earn the sympathy of many

50
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:13.860
poor people in the country they see him

51
00:02:11.37 --> 00:02:16.050
as an example of a rags to riches story

52
00:02:13.86 --> 00:02:21.300
and shows the rags to riches in India

53
00:02:16.05 --> 00:02:23.430
can sometimes work his political

54
00:02:21.3 --> 00:02:25.980
ideology has always been very attached

55
00:02:23.43 --> 00:02:28.019
to Hinduism and he has not always taken

56
00:02:25.98 --> 00:02:30.209
a moderate approach in fact before

57
00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.940
getting involved with the BJP party he

58
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.070
was involved with the RSS party the RSS

70
00:03:00.29 --> 00:03:04.579
alongside these impressive figures

71
00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.260
social welfare has also greatly improved

72
00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.180
almost every home has accessed the

plumbing electricity and preschool

the rest of India furthermore he

promised to do this in just 10 years

this is because the Modi as a year 2022

is a landmark year it's the 75th

world's most populous country reaching a

population of 1.6 billion people Modi

says by the Year 2022 it's going to be

91
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.280
clear that the 21st century is India's

92
00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:59.010
century

93

[Music]

94
00:03:59.01 --> 00:04:04.510
but this is certainly not going to be

95
00:04:02.29 --> 00:04:08.140
easy especially in a country where the

96
00:04:04.51 --> 00:04:15.040
population is growing by 28 people every

97
00:04:08.14 --> 00:04:17.739
minute India major problems now India

98
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:20.380
has many problems but 3 do you stand out

99
00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.200
as particularly important the first is

100
00:04:20.38 --> 00:04:25.389
that India is a bureaucrats paradise in

101
00:04:23.2 --> 00:04:27.550
fact if bureaucracy was the key to

102
00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.440
prosperity India would probably be the

103
00:04:27.55 --> 00:04:31.510
most prosperous country in the world

104
00:04:29.44 --> 00:04:33.669
unfortunately though the errata see

105
00:04:31.51 --> 00:04:36.340
instead of encouraging business actually

106
00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.110
prevents it John Curtin has slimmed the

107
00:04:36.34 --> 00:04:40.240
Indian bureaucracy for putting

108
00:04:38.11 --> 00:04:42.100
roadblocks in the growth of Indian

109
00:04:40.24 --> 00:04:43.450
economies according to the doing

110
00:04:42.1 --> 00:04:45.639
business report from the World Bank

111
00:04:43.45 --> 00:04:49.240
which estimates how easy it is to do

112
00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.950
business India occupies the 130 earth

113
00:04:49.24 --> 00:04:53.470
position each step of the way to

114
00:04:50.95 --> 00:04:55.990
establishing a business in India takes a

115
00:04:53.47 --> 00:04:57.880
ton of document and then the taxes are

116
00:04:55.99 --> 00:05:00.400
not only high not that anyone really

117
00:04:57.88 --> 00:05:02.229
pays them but they are also a nightmare

118
00:05:00.4 --> 00:05:04.450
to sort out for example there are not

119
00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.190
only different taxes in each individual

120
00:05:04.45 --> 00:05:08.169
state but there are sometimes different

121
00:05:06.19 --> 00:05:10.240
taxes for each individual product or

122
00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.800
different models of the same products

123
00:05:10.24 --> 00:05:14.650
this is something that commonly happens

124
00:05:11.8 --> 00:05:18.120
with vehicles and it is a real night map

125
00:05:14.65 --> 00:05:21.100
anyone to work out but all Sicily

126
00:05:18.12 --> 00:05:22.960
Katrina will be here early but it's joke

127
00:05:21.1 --> 00:05:25.030
of a bear for example a banach of

128
00:05:22.96 --> 00:05:26.830
negligent direct further

129
00:05:25.03 --> 00:05:29.169
absenteeism among public workers has

130
00:05:26.83 --> 00:05:30.970
reached such a critical state that some

131
00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.950
hospitals have been forced to close

132
00:05:30.97 --> 00:05:34.570
temporarily because of the lack of staff

133
00:05:32.95 --> 00:05:36.700
the second big problem is that

134
00:05:34.57 --> 00:05:39.250
regulations in the marketplace make it

135
00:05:36.7 --> 00:05:41.320
so complicated that the market is barely

136
00:05:39.25 --> 00:05:43.270
able to function on the borders between

137
00:05:41.32 --> 00:05:45.220
different states you'll find trucks that

138
00:05:43.27 --> 00:05:46.479
are just queueing across the border not

139
00:05:45.22 --> 00:05:48.250
a few people say that it's actually

140
00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.110
easier to import something from abroad

141
00:05:48.25 --> 00:05:52.000
than it is to get something from another

142
00:05:50.11 --> 00:05:53.740
state further there is the terrible

143
00:05:52.0 --> 00:05:54.290
state of the country's infrastructure as

144
00:05:53.74 --> 00:05:57.529
well

145
00:05:54.29 --> 00:05:57.529
[Music]

146
00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.759
as a consequence of this it is estimated

147
00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:04.189
that a half of the country's harvest

148
00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.349
goes to waste every year because of

149
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.659
these delays and the third big problem

150
00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.729
is that corruption is a big issue in

151
00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.800
Indian society as a great example of

152
00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.539
this it is estimated that 50 percent of

153
00:06:12.8 --> 00:06:16.279
all money that the government gives for

154
00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.740
welfare either ends up in the hands of

155
00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.499
corrupt politicians or middlemen and so

156
00:06:18.74 --> 00:06:25.310
this is the country that Modi is having

157
00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:28.939
to deal with the new government

158
00:06:25.31 --> 00:06:30.529
polic the revolution that some have

159
00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.240
suggested has not yet taken place

160
00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.729
however the truth is is that the

161
00:06:32.24 --> 00:06:35.840
government has achieved some notable

162
00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.610
advances for example we could highlight

163
00:06:35.84 --> 00:06:39.800
the following in order to reduce

164
00:06:37.61 --> 00:06:41.090
bureaucracy the government has created a

165
00:06:39.8 --> 00:06:42.979
committee with the purpose of

166
00:06:41.09 --> 00:06:45.229
determining which rules and regulations

167
00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.789
are obsolete and should be eliminated so

168
00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.370
far they've done away with more than

169
00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.169
1700 of these rules Modi has also

170
00:06:49.37 --> 00:06:52.789
eliminated many restrictions on foreign

171
00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.279
investments he has passed the first

172
00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.620
bankruptcy law and to set up a powerful

173
00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.129
planet to make India a destination for

174
00:06:57.62 --> 00:07:00.129
businesses

175
00:07:00.77 --> 00:07:05.750
is also set forth an ambitious plan for

176
00:07:03.41 --> 00:07:07.370
better Financial Inclusion this plan has

177
00:07:05.75 --> 00:07:08.930
a pretty unpronounceable name so I'm

178
00:07:07.37 --> 00:07:11.210
just going to show it on the screen now

179
00:07:08.93 --> 00:07:12.710
and this plan has basically allowed for

180
00:07:11.21 --> 00:07:14.270
people to have a bank account for the

181
00:07:12.71 --> 00:07:16.520
first time the number of people who've

182
00:07:14.27 --> 00:07:18.139
taken this up is about 200 million and

183
00:07:16.52 --> 00:07:19.340
this basically means that that welfare

184
00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.470
money that is coming from the government

185
00:07:19.34 --> 00:07:23.150
doesn't have to go through any middlemen

186
00:07:21.47 --> 00:07:25.009
so that the government is also put forth

187
00:07:23.15 --> 00:07:27.680
a plan to simplifies very complicated

188
00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:32.569
tax system having a flat sales tax at

189
00:07:27.68 --> 00:07:33.500
the national level Modi has also

190
00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:34.610
announced that they're going to be

191
00:07:33.5 --> 00:07:36.830
spending a lot of money on

192
00:07:34.61 --> 00:07:39.110
infrastructure with a hundred and thirty

193
00:07:36.83 --> 00:07:41.389
billion dollars being spent on rail by

194
00:07:39.11 --> 00:07:42.800
2020 so again this year our plan is to

195
00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.690
really connect a lot of these small

196
00:07:42.8 --> 00:07:46.220
towns and cities to the main national

197
00:07:44.69 --> 00:07:48.050
highway and and the target of the

198
00:07:46.22 --> 00:07:50.210
government is to construct ten thousand

199
00:07:48.05 --> 00:07:52.940
kilometers of road every year but these

200
00:07:50.21 --> 00:07:58.000
aside Modi's most risky move so far

201
00:07:52.94 --> 00:07:58.000
happens in November of 2016

202
00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:04.759
India's cash crisis in order to fight

203
00:08:02.69 --> 00:08:06.919
corruption India suddenly made the

204
00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:09.169
country's five hundred and one thousand

205
00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:11.419
rupee notes illegal these represented

206
00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:14.300
eighty-five percent of all of our cash

207
00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:16.610
in India a country that is really a cash

208
00:08:14.3 --> 00:08:18.560
based economy the goal was to find dirty

209
00:08:16.61 --> 00:08:20.570
money and punish it when the owners came

210
00:08:18.56 --> 00:08:22.460
into the bank to switch out their five

211
00:08:20.57 --> 00:08:24.830
hundred and a thousand loads the ones in

212
00:08:22.46 --> 00:08:27.469
the new design however the plan was an

213
00:08:24.83 --> 00:08:29.060
utter disaster the government didn't

214
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:30.949
have enough cash to replace the money

215
00:08:29.06 --> 00:08:32.659
that people wanted to exchange further

216
00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:34.579
the country's ATMs weren't working

217
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.320
properly because the new currency was a

218
00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:38.750
different shape to the old currency and

219
00:08:36.32 --> 00:08:40.159
the ATM hadn't been adjusted I don't

220
00:08:38.75 --> 00:08:42.229
know what to do people here have no

221
00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.270
money to buy my products so I can't buy

222
00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:45.980
stock from the market either it's the

223
00:08:44.27 --> 00:08:47.120
end of my business this was a botched

224
00:08:45.98 --> 00:08:49.640
operation that left the country

225
00:08:47.12 --> 00:08:51.860
moneyless and caused significant damage

226
00:08:49.64 --> 00:08:53.149
to the economy sales fell in November by

227
00:08:51.86 --> 00:08:54.800
more than 30%

228
00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.450
many businesses simply weren't able to

229
00:08:54.8 --> 00:08:58.370
pay their workers and many business

230
00:08:56.45 --> 00:08:59.990
transactions had to be cancelled some

231
00:08:58.37 --> 00:09:02.060
studies estimate that the total damage

232
00:08:59.99 --> 00:09:03.980
with two points of India's GDP this

233
00:09:02.06 --> 00:09:06.470
would mean that the banknotes which cost

234
00:09:03.98 --> 00:09:08.630
India fifty billion dollars and

235
00:09:06.47 --> 00:09:10.459
unfortunately the poorest in the country

236
00:09:08.63 --> 00:09:11.990
were the hardest hit then the government

237
00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:13.880
tried to say that it was all part of

238
00:09:11.99 --> 00:09:14.420
some big plan to encourage people to use

239
00:09:13.88 --> 00:09:19.459
more

240
00:09:14.42 --> 00:09:22.579
electronic money our politicians foreign

241
00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:24.410
policy agenda now this is the field

242
00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:26.540
where the Prime Minister has really

243
00:09:24.41 --> 00:09:30.339
excelled in his first year alone he

244
00:09:26.54 --> 00:09:30.339
visited 19 country

245
00:09:34.36 --> 00:09:37.450
[Music]

246
00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:41.860
by the fact that he's only been in power

247
00:09:40.3 --> 00:09:43.870
for a short amount of time he has

248
00:09:41.86 --> 00:09:45.730
achieved some notable advances the

249
00:09:43.87 --> 00:09:47.800
Pakistan treaty has improved India

250
00:09:45.73 --> 00:09:49.570
Pakistani relations and a relationship

251
00:09:47.8 --> 00:09:51.550
with China has started dealing with some

252
00:09:49.57 --> 00:09:53.890
economic and commercial issues at a

253
00:09:51.55 --> 00:09:55.750
joint press Congress President Xi

254
00:09:53.89 --> 00:09:58.029
Jinping announced 20 billion u.s.

255
00:09:55.75 --> 00:10:00.430
dollars worth of investment in India's

256
00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:02.500
infrastructure in five years however

257
00:10:00.43 --> 00:10:04.899
without any doubt the greatest strength

258
00:10:02.5 --> 00:10:06.790
of Modi's political agenda has been his

259
00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:08.649
approach to the United States the

260
00:10:06.79 --> 00:10:10.300
chemistry between Obama and Modi has

261
00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:11.829
been quite significant and their

262
00:10:10.3 --> 00:10:13.420
encounters have been frequent and

263
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:14.649
friendly they have those even published

264
00:10:13.42 --> 00:10:19.089
an article together in The Washington

265
00:10:14.649 --> 00:10:22.180
Post so what we really need to ask now

266
00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:24.070
is will Modi achieve his goal there are

267
00:10:22.18 --> 00:10:25.959
certainly a great deal of challenges

268
00:10:24.07 --> 00:10:27.610
that he is going to have to overcome for

269
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.470
example it's been made clear to the

270
00:10:27.61 --> 00:10:31.540
Prime Minister just how tricky it is to

271
00:10:29.47 --> 00:10:33.970
put limits on bureaucracy further Modi

272
00:10:31.54 --> 00:10:36.250
has avoided many essential reforms such

273
00:10:33.97 --> 00:10:37.839
as ending Indian labor regulation which

274
00:10:36.25 --> 00:10:40.120
has meant that four out of every five

275
00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:42.459
jobs in the country are on the gray

276
00:10:40.12 --> 00:10:44.709
market Modi claims to be an admirer of

277
00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:46.540
the equine you singapore's X prime

278
00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:48.459
minister but Modi doesn't seem to have

279
00:10:46.54 --> 00:10:51.100
the same Drive or determination to

280
00:10:48.459 --> 00:10:53.110
transform India's model so this is just

281
00:10:51.1 --> 00:10:55.720
our opinion here a visual politic and we

282
00:10:53.11 --> 00:10:57.579
would love to know what you think do you

283
00:10:55.72 --> 00:10:59.589
think that the 21st century is going to

284
00:10:57.579 --> 00:11:01.690
be India century do you think that Modi

285
00:10:59.589 --> 00:11:04.089
is going to achieve all this he has set

286
00:11:01.69 --> 00:11:05.410
out to achieve do let us know in the

287
