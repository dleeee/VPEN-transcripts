2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,180
these are the Inuits one of the few

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,519
tribes that despite having contact with

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,440
Western culture have managed to keep

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,509
their traditions alive the first thing

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,280
you need to know about them is that the

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,100
word Eskimo is extremely offensive this

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,080
is why we call them Inuits even though

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,270
greenland is part of denmark they have

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,340
their own laws their own language and

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,990
their own governments and in the past

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,810
few years lots of Chinese Australian and

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,179
American investors have flocked here why

14
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,920
well I guess you might be able to figure

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
that one out natural resources wise

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,940
Greenland is the new Africa there's oil

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,790
gas zinc gold there's plenty of it and

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,070
it's mainly unexploited this explains

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,690
why Donald Trump is suddenly so

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,879
interested in this territory at the end

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,800
of this video you'll understand why that

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
interest is not quite as crazy as it

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,030
might seem

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,570
[Applause]

25
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,949
[Music]

26
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:00,079
imagine a village with little more than

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,610
50,000 inhabitants that the oil reserves

28
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,899
of Russia

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,150
this is Greenland's current situation

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,790
and this is why news like this is to be

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,950
taken seriously

32
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,840
no jokes Trump really does want to buy

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,820
Greenland yes I know when it comes to

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,109
Donald Trump it's hard to tell whether

35
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,610
he's kidding on our sands of course

36
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,590
tweets like this don't make it any

37
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,049
easier I promise I will not do this to

38
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,520
green man but this time

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,259
it makes a lot of sense we all know that

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,569
Trump is trying hard to make history and

41
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,399
this is perhaps one of his less crazy

42
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,950
attempts to achieve that goal the one

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,450
it's not the first time that America has

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,189
tried to buy Greenland's back in the

45
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,289
1950s president harry s truman made a

46
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,360
solid purchasing offer to the Danish

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,039
crown and let's not forget that America

48
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,840
has already bought many other lands from

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,819
other countries Louisiana Florida and

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,429
Alaska were bought from France Spain and

51
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,799
Russia respectively and finally when it

52
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,750
comes to natural resources Greenland is

53
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,530
the promised land

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,420
Ireland is widely believed to host

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,369
several natural resources including lead

56
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,399
zinc iron or gold copper and last but

57
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,129
certainly not least dare old

58
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,900
and if all the studies are right

59
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,359
Greenland contains 15% of the world's

60
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,670
undiscovered oil beds but if you still

61
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,349
aren't fully convinced the Trump's not

62
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,870
crazy for trying to buy Greenland here's

63
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,920
the real deal

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,170
Greenland's political status is far from

65
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,480
clear yes right now it's not honest

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,459
region within the Kingdom of Denmark but

67
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,769
its political autonomy is growing and in

68
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,000
the future it might become an

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,889
independent country now the question

70
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,260
becomes well how do you even buy

71
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,930
countries or territories is Greenland's

72
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,340
are really that good of an investment

73
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,469
and would Greenlandic citizens have a

74
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,599
say in what happens well today we're

75
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,590
going to answer all of these questions

76
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,680
and more but before we do let's take a

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,949
look back at the history empires through

78
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:59,769
sale usually countries expand by violent

79
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,840
conquering or peaceful annexation but

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,909
these are the only formulas our story

81
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,459
begins in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson the

82
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,169
third President of the United States

83
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,090
purchased about eight hundred and twenty

84
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,590
eight thousand square miles of territory

85
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,469
from Napoleon's France this is what we

86
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,409
know of today as the states of Louisiana

87
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:19,989
Missouri Arkansas Iowa North Dakota

88
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,139
South Dakota Nebraska and Oklahoma for

89
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,790
fifteen million dollars the u.s. doubled

90
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,709
the size of its young Republic of course

91
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,540
it sparked a bit of controversy back

92
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,060
then but France badly needed the money

93
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,739
Napoleon he wanted to conquer Europe

94
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,750
which was far from cheap and America

95
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,699
wanted to become a grown-up country soak

96
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,500
the treaty was signed and immediately

97
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,359
after one of the signers founding father

98
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,400
robert Livingston made this famous

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,940
statement

100
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,000
[Music]

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,610
I've lived long but this is the noblest

102
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,580
work of our whole lives from this day

103
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,200
the United States takes their place

104
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,140
among the powers of the first rank but

105
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,760
this is not the end of the story you see

106
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,410
the 19th century offered lots of

107
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,420
opportunities for a young Republic to

108
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,760
expand the Spanish Empire was at the

109
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,100
brink of bankruptcy and it was trying to

110
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,260
keep its colonies in South America then

111
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,880
France was putting all of its conquering

112
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,070
energies into Africa so basically they

113
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,900
couldn't care less about North American

114
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,910
territories and again they needed money

115
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,100
and this is when America was more than

116
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,500
willing to do business America's second

117
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,000
big purchase was Florida

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,400
in 1819 even though Spain had long

119
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,350
rejected the u.s. as office to purchase

120
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,180
the territory the kingdom of Spain was

121
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,950
having some serious trouble in the

122
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,140
colonies several revolutions in Central

123
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,520
and South America demanded their

124
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,230
attention and the kingdom was worn out

125
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,660
by the war against Napoleon in Europe so

126
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,590
the king had to make a tough decision

127
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,720
and that's how Florida was ceded to the

128
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,300
US which is largely seen as a great

129
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,610
diplomatic victory from that moment on

130
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,620
the US was more than happy to acquire

131
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,720
new territories from Mexico Spain

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,630
Germany etc but the biggest purchase

133
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,990
came decades later and that of course

134
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,270
Alaska

135
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,490
[Music]

136
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,320
yes America's biggest state was bought

137
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,740
from Russia for 7.2 million in 1867 tsar

138
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,750
alexander ii decided to sell it because

139
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,460
the territory would be very difficult to

140
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,350
defend should any future conflict arise

141
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,630
the deal made some politicians frown but

142
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,669
it soon became clear that hadn't been a

143
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:19,490
great move between the purchase in 1867

144
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,530
in the final Alaskan gold rush in the

145
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,840
Klondike many people flocked the region

146
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,550
looking to fulfill their own American

147
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,910
dream

148
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,670
[Applause]

149
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,990
Alaska only managed to become a state in

150
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,270
1959 and according to reports extractive

151
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,980
industries accounted for 15 percent of

152
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,100
its GDP in 2016 and what do these

153
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,160
industries extract exactly well yes of

154
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,470
course that would be oil as of now asker

155
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,910
is one of the top five crude oil

156
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,890
producers in the nation and the state's

157
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,170
output in 2017 was the highest in three

158
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,570
years the state also ranks third in the

159
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,640
u.s. for natural gas production so again

160
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,950
weird as it might sound buying Alaska

161
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,080
from the Russians was actually a pretty

162
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,420
solid investment but ok I know what

163
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,560
you're thinking all that land was

164
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,360
purchased from absolute monarchies or

165
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,130
colonial powers the people living there

166
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,470
they didn't have much say about who they

167
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,540
wanted to be governed by but now things

168
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,460
have changed green lenders have rights

169
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,530
and they vote in elections and besides

170
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,240
is Greenland's really such a great

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,590
business opportunity well let's have a

172
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,130
look shall we

173
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,990
[Music]

174
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,030
the would-be richest country on earth

175
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,740
and despite the enormous wealth of

176
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,690
resources Greenlanders have under their

177
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,910
feet their most important industry at

178
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,590
the moment is fishing which contributes

179
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,410
90% of the islands total export value in

180
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,540
fact more than a third of these 56,000

181
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,400
people living in Greenland work one way

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,870
or another for the Danish government

183
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,400
some of them are civil servants and

184
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,620
others are employed at some subsidizing

185
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,960
company like a shopping mall yep you

186
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,280
heard that right Greenland's capital

187
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,500
nuke has little more than 16 thousand

188
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,940
inhabitants and they have a mall that is

189
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,280
paid for with Danish money every year

190
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,980
Denmark stands around 530 million u.s.

191
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,170
dollars in transfers to Greenland that's

192
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,940
more than nine thousand dollars per

193
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,100
inhabitant every year and Denmark

194
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,960
citizens they get little in return but

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,730
things are changing

196
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,780
[Music]

197
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,670
a few years ago a lot of Chinese and

198
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,200
Australian mining companies started

199
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,580
showing interest in Greenland's

200
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,350
potential and that's when Europe

201
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,360
realized they couldn't let the Chinese

202
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,090
be the only waters

203
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,820
we need innovative partnerships with

204
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,620
other countries over raw materials

205
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,690
companies are pushing the commission for

206
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,330
this they need this to survive Europe is

207
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,190
not so wealthy in raw materials and

208
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,840
needs to do better at forming

209
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,970
partnerships with other countries

210
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,010
antonio tejani european commissioner of

211
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,010
industry in 2012 and the question is why

212
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,020
I mean having so much oil and other

213
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,800
resources

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,020
why don't they exploit that wealth it's

215
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,280
because of environmental concerns please

216
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,690
the let's be serious here of course

217
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,250
everybody would love to exploit this

218
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,229
natural resources but good luck drilling

219
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:04,870
under a kilometer thick layer of ice yes

220
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,979
just a guess you didn't realize

221
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:08,410
Greenland has a ton of ice and in some

222
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,970
places we're talking about layers that

223
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,860
can surpass one kilometer in thickness

224
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,900
and even though climate change might

225
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,210
make things easier it also creates other

226
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,250
problems that oil we're talking about is

227
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,020
concentrated on the coast and if you

228
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,790
thought the Greenlandic coastline was

229
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,040
like the frozen version of Venice Beach

230
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,669
well you better think again

231
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,259
you know that iceberg that sunk the

232
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,940
Titanic well chances are that it came

233
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,919
from Greenland's most of the icebergs in

234
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,839
the Atlantic they come from there and

235
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,399
we're talking about an ice rock that is

236
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,919
as big as a residential building when it

237
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,140
breaks off from the mainland in just a

238
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,120
matter of minutes believe me you don't

239
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,339
want to have an oil platform right next

240
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,230
to a place where icebergs are forming

241
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,329
and guess what more the ice cap melts

242
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:53,220
the more icebergs there are but assuming

243
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,019
that you manage to find a way to extract

244
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,240
some oil from a safe spot or drill

245
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,890
through a 1 kilometer thick layer of ice

246
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,990
then you'll have the next problem and

247
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:07,529
that's infrastructure for example in the

248
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:08,940
northernmost part of the islands an

249
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,500
Australian company is preparing to

250
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,269
exploit zinc mine once they finish

251
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:13,560
building the project it might even

252
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,720
become the world's biggest zinc mine but

253
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,250
don't forget that the distance from that

254
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,560
line to the Greenland's at capital nuke

255
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,690
is as far as the distance from a central

256
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,240
Norway to Gibraltar which is near Spain

257
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,550
and there are no roads no railways to

258
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,529
connect those two points remember that

259
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:29,640
the central part of Greenland is

260
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,800
completely unfit for human habitation in

261
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,660
fact only 3 percent of the island's

262
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,000
entire surface is fit for living this

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
explains why there are over 56,000

264
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,050
Greenlanders who are concentrated in

265
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,790
just a few villages of course though

266
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,959
that can still be mines that are

267
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,790
profitable a good example is the zinc

268
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,050
mine that we're talking about but in

269
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,910
order to make it happen this Australian

270
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,040
company whose name is ironbark had to

271
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,260
invest more than 500 million dollars in

272
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,670
other words in order to extract wealth

273
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,800
in Greenland you have to make a big

274
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,630
investment but let's stop talking about

275
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,579
economics and let's dig deeper into

276
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,709
politics because even if Greenland could

277
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,630
build that infrastructure and technology

278
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,670
became cheaper America would still need

279
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,050
to convince the Danish and the

280
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,820
Greenlanders to sell out to them and

281
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,500
well what are the chances of that

282
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,790
happening well let's find out

283
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,620
a strange relationship greenland's has

284
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,700
been part of the Kingdom of Denmark

285
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,490
since 1840 still they have kept most of

286
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,620
their Inuit tradition and laws and you

287
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,630
might wonder how is this possible how

288
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,220
can Denmark one of the most modern

289
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,620
countries on earth except a region where

290
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,570
they don't even have laws to grant

291
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,640
private lands and that's not all we're

292
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,900
talking about the area of the planet

293
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,790
with the world's highest suicide rate

294
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,830
where gender violence and Alcoholism

295
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,570
they're still pretty common and crime

296
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,670
rates outnumber those of any European

297
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,030
country the truth is that despite being

298
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,650
owned by the Kingdom of Denmark since

299
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,080
1814 Greenland's became an autonomous

300
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,780
region in 1974 basically an autonomous

301
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,730
County it became even more independent

302
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,400
in 2009 when more than 70% of

303
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,320
Greenlanders voted in favor of the

304
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,450
self-government act now Danish isn't

305
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,010
even the official language of the island

306
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,390
the government is pushing hard to have

307
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,070
the color suit language taught in all

308
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,720
schools Greenland even has the local

309
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
Parliament's so most of their

310
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,630
relationship with Copenhagen can be

311
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,880
summarised by the two reserved seats

312
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
that they have in the Danish Parliament

313
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,800
[Laughter]

314
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,170
this and of course the money because for

315
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,850
200 years Denmark has been transferring

316
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,709
money to Greenland and getting little in

317
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,749
return and especially after the 1950s

318
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:33,730
Denmark sought to transform Greenland

319
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,439
and its economy into a completely

320
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,269
self-sufficient one for example in the

321
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,939
1950s and 1960s Danish funded and Danish

322
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,019
designed housing and other

323
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,119
infrastructure contributed to turning

324
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,129
nuke Greenland's capital into a city if

325
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,389
you go to nuke you can find lots of

326
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,939
European amenities and malls all paid

327
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,459
for by Denmark but still life expectancy

328
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,199
is 10 years shorter than Denmark's

329
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,389
unemployment is high and the region has

330
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,279
as we mentioned the world's highest

331
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,470
suicide rate and in the cultural clash

332
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,449
which we Inuit tribalism and Danish

333
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:03,549
influence you can understand why so many

334
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:05,350
green lenders want to become a sovereign

335
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,299
nation they're independent is party is a

336
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,100
powerful force in Parliament and more

337
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,779
than 67 percent of the adult population

338
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:13,269
is convinced that independence is the

339
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,799
way to go I still believe that Greenland

340
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,839
will achieve independence during the

341
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,699
time that I'm still active in politics

342
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,429
alayka Hammond former Greenlandic

343
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,439
premier but as you can imagine Denmark

344
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,089
wants to keep Greenland's because after

345
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:29,709
decades of paying so much without

346
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,779
getting anything in return things may

347
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:32,840
finally change

348
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,570
[Music]

349
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,430
the country's set to cash in on climate

350
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,110
change record temperatures threaten

351
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,760
traditional ways of life in Greenland

352
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,670
but as the sea ice retreats new mining

353
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,560
fishing and tourism opportunities are

354
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,899
helping communities to adapt as global

355
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,639
warming continues to melt the Arctic ice

356
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,380
Greenland's resources are becoming more

357
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,149
accessible the political establishment

358
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,649
in Greenland has made extracting those

359
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,899
resources their focal point in order to

360
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,490
achieve full independence from Denmark

361
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,500
and again if you thought that those

362
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,839
Greenlandic nationalist politicians so

363
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,820
proud of their Inuit traditions are

364
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,130
diehard ecologist cyou will never sell

365
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,079
out to the big oil companies well you'd

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,190
better think again

367
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,690
three handers are very good at seeing

368
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,699
new opportunities we've simply refused

369
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,199
to be victimized due to climate change

370
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,970
I'm very optimistic

371
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,889
I see more positive options for the

372
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,750
country than negatives I wish that it

373
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,730
weren't happening but it is and that's a

374
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,649
fact once it's there you have an

375
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,079
obligation to do the best of it alayka

376
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,760
Hammond country's former prime minister

377
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,730
in fact in 2013 Greenland's Parliament's

378
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,470
reversed a decades-old ban on uranium

379
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,720
mining so another Australian mining

380
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,940
company Greenland minerals already has

381
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,190
plans for a major uranium and rare earth

382
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,930
minerals mine at a mountain in the

383
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,550
southern coast but it's not just about

384
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,410
the reserves is also about the Arctic

385
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,000
routes that might develop in the future

386
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,100
the receding ice cap is opening up the

387
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,990
Northwest Passage a change that has the

388
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,120
potential to completely reshape global

389
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,740
shipping

390
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,510
if this comes to pass we would be

391
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,040
talking about routes that would be a

392
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,410
gift for nations like China the passage

393
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,480
became ice free in 2007 in countries

394
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,980
soon began talking about it as a

395
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,870
potential seasonal alternative to the

396
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,880
Suez and Panama canal's since it would

397
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,620
enable the shippers to save time and

398
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,630
avoid pirate-infested regions all of

399
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,910
this explains why Trump is so interested

400
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,380
in Greenland's but the Danish government

401
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,200
is absolutely not willing to make this

402
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,870
purchase happen and then is not for sale

403
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,730
Greenland is not Danish Greenland

404
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,350
belongs to Greenland I strongly hope

405
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,330
that this is not meant seriously Danish

406
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,580
Prime Minister met Fredrickson responded

407
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,690
and this is the question that we have

408
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,610
for you do you think Greenlanders would

409
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,800
be happy to be sold to America should

410
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,900
they keep trying for independence do you

411
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,790
think they can really reap the benefits

412
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,710
of the enormous wealth that they have

413
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,480
under their feet well please leave your

414
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,130
