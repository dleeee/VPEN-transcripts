2
00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.490
lately the word brexit has become a

3
00:00:09.24 --> 00:00:13.679
synonym for apocalypse for most of media

4
00:00:11.49 --> 00:00:15.299
at least the media outside of the UK

5
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.820
there are many things to be said about

6
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.189
this but today we're going to focus on

7
00:00:17.82 --> 00:00:25.650
this goldman sachs to move hundreds of

8
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.240
its staff out of london and this is just

9
00:00:25.65 --> 00:00:28.650
one example that the time we're making

10
00:00:27.24 --> 00:00:30.330
this video 20 banks have already

11
00:00:28.65 --> 00:00:32.700
announced they will move part of their

12
00:00:30.33 --> 00:00:34.230
staff out of the UK the most optimistic

13
00:00:32.7 --> 00:00:36.809
estimations claim that the City of

14
00:00:34.23 --> 00:00:39.329
London might lose over 30,000 workers

15
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.420
and the most pessimistic argue that this

16
00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
could be as high as 200 thousands but

17
00:00:42.42 --> 00:00:46.500
wait just a minute I mean why is this

18
00:00:44.61 --> 00:00:48.329
important well if you've been following

19
00:00:46.5 --> 00:00:50.280
visual politic for a while you already

20
00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.469
know that London is the global financial

21
00:00:50.28 --> 00:00:54.480
capital more specifically that global

22
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.879
financial capital would be the City of

23
00:00:54.48 --> 00:00:59.070
London also known as the square mile the

24
00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.660
square mile is essentially a city inside

25
00:00:59.07 --> 00:01:01.859
of a city where most of the

26
00:01:00.66 --> 00:01:04.199
international banks have their

27
00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.790
headquarters

28
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.650
yes even after brexit it is possible

29
00:01:06.79 --> 00:01:11.110
that London will keep its way on the

30
00:01:08.65 --> 00:01:13.120
markets in Asia and even America but so

31
00:01:11.11 --> 00:01:15.520
far European business accounts for 35%

32
00:01:13.12 --> 00:01:18.010
of the city's workload and of course

33
00:01:15.52 --> 00:01:19.480
leaving the European Union is going to

34
00:01:18.01 --> 00:01:21.010
have some consequences

35
00:01:19.48 --> 00:01:22.720
well now you might be wondering well

36
00:01:21.01 --> 00:01:24.820
where are these banks gonna go which

37
00:01:22.72 --> 00:01:25.450
city will be the new financial capital

38
00:01:24.82 --> 00:01:27.130
after London

39
00:01:25.45 --> 00:01:30.930
well after months of competition it does

40
00:01:27.13 --> 00:01:30.930
seem as if we do finally have a winner

41
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:37.509
banks and other companies plan expansion

42
00:01:35.05 --> 00:01:39.009
in Frankfort after brexit so far it

43
00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.930
looks as if Frankfort is going to become

44
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.000
the new financial powerhouse in Europe

45
00:01:40.93 --> 00:01:45.280
and perhaps one of the most important in

46
00:01:43.0 --> 00:01:46.869
the entire world but what does Frankfort

47
00:01:45.28 --> 00:01:49.630
have that other cities like Madrid or

48
00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.430
Paris don't well today we are going to

49
00:01:49.63 --> 00:01:55.020
answer this question but before we do

50
00:01:51.43 --> 00:01:55.020
let's have a look back at the history

51
00:01:57.59 --> 00:02:02.990
why are banks leaving the city the City

52
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.729
of London is an area about a square mile

53
00:02:02.99 --> 00:02:06.829
see where the name comes from which is

54
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.330
located inside broader London they have

55
00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.130
their own laws they have their own mayor

56
00:02:08.33 --> 00:02:11.750
they even have their own police this

57
00:02:10.13 --> 00:02:13.730
little space is the home for the main

58
00:02:11.75 --> 00:02:15.349
international banks three hundred

59
00:02:13.73 --> 00:02:17.599
thousand people work here and of this

60
00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.610
three hundred thousand 60,000 are

61
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.319
European immigrants who entered the

62
00:02:19.61 --> 00:02:23.180
country thanks to being part of the

63
00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.590
European Union and okay my dear

64
00:02:23.18 --> 00:02:26.480
countrymen I know what you're thinking

65
00:02:24.59 --> 00:02:28.069
despite being an EU country that UK

66
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:29.209
never was really inside the free

67
00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.830
circulation area

68
00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.269
this means that theoretically the

69
00:02:30.83 --> 00:02:33.799
British government could have closed the

70
00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.780
borders to all those immigrants of any

71
00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.310
time they wanted but in practice

72
00:02:35.78 --> 00:02:39.170
European citizens were getting in and

73
00:02:37.31 --> 00:02:41.090
out of the country as they pleased it's

74
00:02:39.17 --> 00:02:42.830
clear that EU migration to the UK has

75
00:02:41.09 --> 00:02:45.950
increased significantly over the last

76
00:02:42.83 --> 00:02:47.870
two decades in 2015 there were just over

77
00:02:45.95 --> 00:02:49.730
three million people living in the UK

78
00:02:47.87 --> 00:02:53.030
who were born in other EU countries an

79
00:02:49.73 --> 00:02:55.489
increase of about 1.9 million since 2003

80
00:02:53.03 --> 00:02:58.250
nevertheless things they are going to

81
00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.890
change order questions to the Prime

82
00:02:58.25 --> 00:03:01.970
Minister the British prime minister

83
00:02:59.89 --> 00:03:05.350
Conservative Theresa May holds an

84
00:03:01.97 --> 00:03:05.350
extremely weak position

85
00:03:05.62 --> 00:03:10.250
this is despite the fact that she won

86
00:03:08.09 --> 00:03:11.629
the general election in June she just

87
00:03:10.25 --> 00:03:13.700
lost a large number of seats in

88
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.019
parliament doing math in fact it's not

89
00:03:13.7 --> 00:03:17.569
even clear if she's gonna finish our

90
00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.579
turn and of course people from in and

91
00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.680
out of a party they are pushing her to

92
00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.810
increase immigration controls I've

93
00:03:21.68 --> 00:03:26.329
consistently said that the referendum

94
00:03:23.81 --> 00:03:27.859
vote was a vote for us to change that

95
00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.629
freedom of movement was a vote for us to

96
00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.040
bring control into our immigration

97
00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.689
system for people coming from the

98
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:34.430
European Union there's a variety of ways

99
00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.409
in which that can be done this would

100
00:03:34.43 --> 00:03:38.180
have a big impact in the city of London

101
00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.099
indeed a bigger impact than anywhere

102
00:03:38.18 --> 00:03:42.290
else in the UK as we said in another

103
00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.060
video part of London's success comes

104
00:03:42.29 --> 00:03:45.799
from their ability to attract talent

105
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:47.510
from all over the world but if the

106
00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.280
government closes its doors to

107
00:03:47.51 --> 00:03:51.319
foreigners those banks who hire

108
00:03:49.28 --> 00:03:53.659
immigrants will have it as significantly

109
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.239
harder than before and make no mistake

110
00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.099
this is not only due to praxis in fact

111
00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.409
the anti-immigrant sentiment in the UK

112
00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.490
it's been going well beyond the borders

113
00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.180
of the European Union

114
00:04:02.49 --> 00:04:07.769
[Music]

115
00:04:05.18 --> 00:04:10.590
Teresa may to charge companies two

116
00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.530
thousand pounds per year for each non

117
00:04:10.59 --> 00:04:15.510
European Union worker they employ but

118
00:04:13.53 --> 00:04:16.739
wait a minute because there's still more

119
00:04:15.51 --> 00:04:18.600
as I said Teresa may and her

120
00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.160
Conservative Party have lost a good

121
00:04:18.6 --> 00:04:22.470
share of the seats in parliament and

122
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:24.300
well where did those seats go well they

123
00:04:22.47 --> 00:04:25.650
went to the Labor Party a party whose

124
00:04:24.3 --> 00:04:28.169
leader Jeremy Corbyn

125
00:04:25.65 --> 00:04:30.090
has declared war on the backs on his

126
00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.490
election manifesto he already proposed

127
00:04:30.09 --> 00:04:39.590
things like of this Labour called

128
00:04:35.49 --> 00:04:39.590
through UK financial transaction tax

129
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.610
until now this tax was one of the

130
00:04:42.33 --> 00:04:46.830
biggest advantages the UK had over the

131
00:04:44.61 --> 00:04:48.570
EU as you might know Brussels has been

132
00:04:46.83 --> 00:04:51.570
for years debating the possibility of

133
00:04:48.57 --> 00:04:53.580
having a financial transaction tax this

134
00:04:51.57 --> 00:04:55.740
is something bankers really don't want

135
00:04:53.58 --> 00:04:58.080
and no one really wants to pay but if

136
00:04:55.74 --> 00:04:59.910
the UK's parliament ends up passing such

137
00:04:58.08 --> 00:05:01.500
a law a lot of companies will be

138
00:04:59.91 --> 00:05:03.330
wondering if they still want to keep

139
00:05:01.5 --> 00:05:05.760
their offices in London in other words

140
00:05:03.33 --> 00:05:07.889
even if the brexit negotiations end up

141
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:09.810
being great for the UK's interests the

142
00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.120
air is still becoming more and more

143
00:05:09.81 --> 00:05:13.830
poisonous for the UK's financial

144
00:05:12.12 --> 00:05:15.300
industry and this explains why so many

145
00:05:13.83 --> 00:05:19.039
banks are starting to think about

146
00:05:15.3 --> 00:05:21.409
opening offices outside of the UK

147
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.869
but now the question is why are they

148
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.490
choosing Frankfurt well let's have a

149
00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:28.420
look at that

150
00:05:25.49 --> 00:05:30.850
[Applause]

151
00:05:28.42 --> 00:05:32.980
Europe's financial capital on the very

152
00:05:30.85 --> 00:05:34.810
day after the brexit referendum the race

153
00:05:32.98 --> 00:05:37.150
to take over London as the global

154
00:05:34.81 --> 00:05:38.980
financial capital started for example in

155
00:05:37.15 --> 00:05:40.990
Spain the regional governments of Madrid

156
00:05:38.98 --> 00:05:44.640
launched their own advertising campaign

157
00:05:40.99 --> 00:05:44.640
designed to attract bangers

158
00:05:44.92 --> 00:05:48.890
even the finance minister Louise Dugan

159
00:05:47.42 --> 00:05:50.780
does help personal meetings with

160
00:05:48.89 --> 00:05:53.300
executives from JPMorgan and elsewhere

161
00:05:50.78 --> 00:05:54.950
to offer special tax conditions in Paris

162
00:05:53.3 --> 00:05:56.870
Emmanuel macron had already announced

163
00:05:54.95 --> 00:05:59.390
lower taxes for banks in order to lure

164
00:05:56.87 --> 00:06:02.370
them from London but I'm sorry guys it's

165
00:05:59.39 --> 00:06:04.120
really hard to beat the Indira Frankfurt

166
00:06:02.37 --> 00:06:07.639
[Applause]

167
00:06:04.12 --> 00:06:10.639
Standard Chartered plc Nomura Holdings

168
00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.830
Inc and Daiwa securities Group Inc have

169
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.560
all picked Germany's financial capital

170
00:06:12.83 --> 00:06:17.090
for their EU base to ensure continued

171
00:06:15.56 --> 00:06:19.400
access to the single market which we

172
00:06:17.09 --> 00:06:21.229
want to still work through Twitter if

173
00:06:19.4 --> 00:06:23.630
you slipped upon balls and clock foot

174
00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.789
city grouping Goldman Sachs group and

175
00:06:23.63 --> 00:06:27.710
Morgan Stanley are weighing a similar

176
00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.990
decision but what's so special about

177
00:06:27.71 --> 00:06:31.550
this city well first of all Frankfurt

178
00:06:29.99 --> 00:06:33.620
already has the headquarters of the

179
00:06:31.55 --> 00:06:35.479
European Central Bank as well as other

180
00:06:33.62 --> 00:06:37.280
big banks like Deutsche Bank this means

181
00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.990
that they already have the network

182
00:06:37.28 --> 00:06:40.340
effects we always mention here official

183
00:06:38.99 --> 00:06:43.130
politic they have lots of other things

184
00:06:40.34 --> 00:06:45.260
like startups law firms consultancy etc

185
00:06:43.13 --> 00:06:46.970
besides Frankfurt has many business

186
00:06:45.26 --> 00:06:48.590
schools with international prestige as

187
00:06:46.97 --> 00:06:50.600
well as a university and the

188
00:06:48.59 --> 00:06:53.389
second-biggest airport in Europe you now

189
00:06:50.6 --> 00:06:57.199
have in Frankfurt like foreign that

190
00:06:53.389 --> 00:07:00.979
Chinese companies we have like a tonne

191
00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:03.560
Turkish companies 1000 companies from

192
00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.930
the United States only the rate of the

193
00:07:03.56 --> 00:07:08.000
English companies is quite little but

194
00:07:05.93 --> 00:07:11.060
this will change from my point of view

195
00:07:08.0 --> 00:07:13.039
automatically if this was not enough 70%

196
00:07:11.06 --> 00:07:15.020
of the German population speak English

197
00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.460
fluently this means those British banks

198
00:07:15.02 --> 00:07:18.380
can send their managers to Frankfurt

199
00:07:16.46 --> 00:07:20.539
hold international meetings and even

200
00:07:18.38 --> 00:07:22.340
hire locals without having to worry

201
00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:24.349
about language if you think this is not

202
00:07:22.34 --> 00:07:26.570
important good luck trying to find the

203
00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:28.820
same setup in France where only 39

204
00:07:26.57 --> 00:07:30.710
percent of the population speaks

205
00:07:28.82 --> 00:07:32.690
Shakespeare's language not to mention

206
00:07:30.71 --> 00:07:35.530
Spain where this percentage is lower

207
00:07:32.69 --> 00:07:35.530
than 25%

208
00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.759
but hold on a minute because there is

209
00:07:37.96 --> 00:07:42.669
still more as I said in a previous video

210
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.560
Germany is a decentralized country

211
00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:46.659
this means regional governments and

212
00:07:44.56 --> 00:07:48.129
trade unions have way more autonomy here

213
00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:49.870
than they have in any other country

214
00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:51.879
thanks to this political architecture

215
00:07:49.87 --> 00:07:56.219
the region of Hessen where Frankfurt is

216
00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:56.219
other cases can offer things like this

217
00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.979
labor laws make it difficult to fire

218
00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:02.050
people

219
00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:04.210
Frankfurt had initially proposed a

220
00:08:02.05 --> 00:08:06.340
change in labor laws that would either

221
00:08:04.21 --> 00:08:08.949
exempt bankers or high income earners

222
00:08:06.34 --> 00:08:10.659
more generally from the rules okay but

223
00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:12.099
now let's think about something else if

224
00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:14.020
you have a bank and you want to set up

225
00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:16.180
your offices somewhere what is the first

226
00:08:14.02 --> 00:08:18.460
thing you will need well that would be a

227
00:08:16.18 --> 00:08:20.169
building you need a physical place where

228
00:08:18.46 --> 00:08:22.090
you can put your offices well in this

229
00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:24.069
regard Frankfurt is better suited than

230
00:08:22.09 --> 00:08:25.389
anywhere else you see after world war ii

231
00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:27.729
you frankfurt it was totally destroyed

232
00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:29.589
and they had to rebuild it almost from

233
00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:31.419
nothing in other German cities urban

234
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:33.370
laws forbid the building of skyscrapers

235
00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:35.560
in order to maintain the uniform more

236
00:08:33.37 --> 00:08:37.510
traditional skyline but not in Frankfurt

237
00:08:35.56 --> 00:08:39.810
here you can make buildings as high as

238
00:08:37.51 --> 00:08:39.810
what

239
00:08:40.13 --> 00:08:45.090
[Music]

240
00:08:42.23 --> 00:08:46.730
this explains why despite a population

241
00:08:45.09 --> 00:08:49.170
of less than 1 million inhabitants

242
00:08:46.73 --> 00:08:51.450
Frankfurt looks like a big metropolis

243
00:08:49.17 --> 00:08:53.070
further Germany as one of the cheapest

244
00:08:51.45 --> 00:08:55.080
real estate markets in all of Europe

245
00:08:53.07 --> 00:08:56.640
despite the high salaries houses rents

246
00:08:55.08 --> 00:08:58.740
and square meters are half the price of

247
00:08:56.64 --> 00:09:01.100
Paris and a fraction of the cost of

248
00:08:58.74 --> 00:09:01.100
London

249
00:09:03.2 --> 00:09:06.990
okay okay but now I know what you're

250
00:09:05.52 --> 00:09:08.279
thinking I mean come on Simon what about

251
00:09:06.99 --> 00:09:10.560
corporate tax isn't this the most

252
00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:12.720
important thing of all well yeah I know

253
00:09:10.56 --> 00:09:15.570
Germany has a corporate tax that in some

254
00:09:12.72 --> 00:09:17.490
cases reaches 30% by comparison the UK's

255
00:09:15.57 --> 00:09:18.750
at 20 and you're absolutely right but

256
00:09:17.49 --> 00:09:19.290
the devil here it's really in the

257
00:09:18.75 --> 00:09:20.640
details

258
00:09:19.29 --> 00:09:22.410
do you ever how I said that Germany is

259
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:24.390
highly decentralized well this applies

260
00:09:22.41 --> 00:09:26.070
to corporate tax too in this country

261
00:09:24.39 --> 00:09:28.260
corporate tax it's divided into two

262
00:09:26.07 --> 00:09:29.880
parts a national and a regional one this

263
00:09:28.26 --> 00:09:32.820
means that the federal government gets

264
00:09:29.88 --> 00:09:35.270
only 15% of the tax the rest depends on

265
00:09:32.82 --> 00:09:35.270
the region

266
00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:39.939
this means technically the state of

267
00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:42.609
Hesse on where Frankfurt is really has

268
00:09:39.939 --> 00:09:44.649
the ability to reduce this tax a lot and

269
00:09:42.609 --> 00:09:45.970
of course doing this might endure more

270
00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:47.739
and more British bankers there and

271
00:09:45.97 --> 00:09:49.989
finally if none of this was enough for

272
00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:52.629
you here comes the big finale the

273
00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:54.220
financial transaction tax this was the

274
00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:56.529
tax that we mentioned before that scares

275
00:09:54.22 --> 00:09:58.600
away so many bankers that tax at least

276
00:09:56.529 --> 00:10:00.699
in Europe has about as many loopholes as

277
00:09:58.6 --> 00:10:02.649
possible there are so many exceptions on

278
00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:04.809
this tax that even its biggest supporter

279
00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:09.730
the German Finance Minister had this to

280
00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:11.350
say even as Swiss cheese needs more than

281
00:10:09.73 --> 00:10:13.629
holes there has to be something in

282
00:10:11.35 --> 00:10:18.740
between them otherwise it's just a hole

283
00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:20.630
not a Swiss cheese Wolfgang schäuble

284
00:10:18.74 --> 00:10:22.790
so now we have a question for you

285
00:10:20.63 --> 00:10:24.620
imagine you are the manager of one of

286
00:10:22.79 --> 00:10:26.090
these London banks what would you do

287
00:10:24.62 --> 00:10:27.650
would you remain in London or perhaps

288
00:10:26.09 --> 00:10:29.330
would you move your offices to Frankfurt

289
00:10:27.65 --> 00:10:30.800
well do let us know in the comments
