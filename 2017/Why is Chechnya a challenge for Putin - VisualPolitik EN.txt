[Music]

3
00:00:06.98 --> 00:00:11.820
Chechnya is an island of Islamic

4
00:00:09.33 --> 00:00:14.400
fanaticism in the middle of Vladimir

5
00:00:11.82 --> 00:00:15.960
Putin's Russia yup you heard that right

6
00:00:14.4 --> 00:00:18.300
in the country that congratulate sit

7
00:00:15.96 --> 00:00:20.100
self on being the spiritual shelter of

8
00:00:18.3 --> 00:00:22.289
the West the last bulwark of

9
00:00:20.1 --> 00:00:24.330
Christianity this is a country where you

10
00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.310
can find the Republic of Chechnya it's a

11
00:00:24.33 --> 00:00:31.830
part of Russia where it is impossible to

12
00:00:26.31 --> 00:00:33.450
buy mod car oh yes and I know what

13
00:00:31.83 --> 00:00:35.070
you're going to say are you waited in

14
00:00:33.45 --> 00:00:37.200
assignment didn't you just say the

15
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:38.670
Republic of Chechnya didn't you say that

16
00:00:37.2 --> 00:00:40.559
it was a part of Russia well the truth

17
00:00:38.67 --> 00:00:42.450
is the Russian Federation is territory

18
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
wise the biggest country in the world

19
00:00:42.45 --> 00:00:46.680
and that means that their political

20
00:00:43.92 --> 00:00:48.090
distribution is really complicated the

21
00:00:46.68 --> 00:00:50.250
biggest part of the country is divided

22
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:51.960
into the so called or blasts which are

23
00:00:50.25 --> 00:00:54.000
similar to the states in the United

24
00:00:51.96 --> 00:00:55.110
States of America these areas they have

25
00:00:54.0 --> 00:00:57.030
their own governor they have their own

26
00:00:55.11 --> 00:00:58.980
Parliament's but they must respect the

27
00:00:57.03 --> 00:01:00.870
Russian Constitution as well as the

28
00:00:58.98 --> 00:01:03.359
Kremlin however there are other regions

29
00:01:00.87 --> 00:01:05.670
in Russia the so-called Republic's that

30
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.960
have way more autonomy they have their

31
00:01:05.67 --> 00:01:08.250
own Constitution they have their own

32
00:01:06.96 --> 00:01:14.640
language and they can even have their

33
00:01:08.25 --> 00:01:17.070
own official religion one of these

34
00:01:14.64 --> 00:01:19.259
Republic's is the Crimean Republic and

35
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:21.659
despite not being recognized by America

36
00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.450
or by Europe it is controlled by Russia

37
00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.869
you see in theory Russian law guarantees

38
00:01:24.45 --> 00:01:29.610
a lot of autonomy Baths I say in theory

39
00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.890
like that because as you know Vladimir

40
00:01:29.61 --> 00:01:34.710
Putin loves to keep this country under

41
00:01:31.89 --> 00:01:36.600
tight control in fact almost all of the

42
00:01:34.71 --> 00:01:38.520
presidents of the Republic's belong to

43
00:01:36.6 --> 00:01:40.770
Putin's political party and that would

44
00:01:38.52 --> 00:01:42.869
be United Russia any time one of those

45
00:01:40.77 --> 00:01:46.850
governors challengers Putin even just

46
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.850
the little things like this happen

47
00:01:47.11 --> 00:01:52.040
Tatarstan the last region to lose its

48
00:01:49.94 --> 00:01:54.380
special status under Putin nonetheless

49
00:01:52.04 --> 00:01:55.970
there is a republic that Putin does not

50
00:01:54.38 --> 00:01:58.010
dare to bully yep you heard that right

51
00:01:55.97 --> 00:02:00.670
Vladimir Putin the Chuck Norris of

52
00:01:58.01 --> 00:02:03.970
politics is afraid sometimes too

53
00:02:00.67 --> 00:02:06.920
specifically when it comes to Chechnya

54
00:02:03.97 --> 00:02:09.259
it is often unclear who rules whom

55
00:02:06.92 --> 00:02:11.510
Russian observers of the region complain

56
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.750
that Russian law and authority stops at

57
00:02:11.51 --> 00:02:18.290
the Chechnya border

58
00:02:13.75 --> 00:02:21.299
[Music]

59
00:02:18.29 --> 00:02:23.159
for example in Chechnya the hijab is

60
00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.349
promoted by the government's things like

61
00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.379
polygamy and even marriages involving

62
00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.689
minors are actually tolerated and no

63
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.480
restaurant dares to open a day time

64
00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.489
during Ramadan season nonetheless all of

65
00:02:33.48 --> 00:02:38.840
these things are nothing compared to

66
00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:44.849
what some newspapers showed in April of

67
00:02:38.84 --> 00:02:47.159
2017 Chechnya opens world's first

68
00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.319
concentration camp for homosexuals yeah

69
00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.389
yeah listen I know Putin is not exactly

70
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.269
the biggest fan of LGBT rights but

71
00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:57.389
opening a gay concentration camp sounds

72
00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.430
like it it too much even for him so the

73
00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.459
question to be made here is why doesn't

74
00:02:59.43 --> 00:03:04.560
Putin put some order into Chechnya what

75
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.319
is the Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov

76
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:09.180
secret to getting Putin to let him do as

77
00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.219
he pleases well today we are going to

78
00:03:09.18 --> 00:03:13.319
answer all of those questions but before

79
00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.739
we do let's take a look back at the

80
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.739
history

81
00:03:16.45 --> 00:03:21.910
the Sicily of the Caucasus fourth

82
00:03:19.42 --> 00:03:24.310
centuries Chechnya was ruled by big

83
00:03:21.91 --> 00:03:26.770
clans that had power over specific areas

84
00:03:24.31 --> 00:03:28.750
those clans named took hung in the

85
00:03:26.77 --> 00:03:31.000
chechen language were composed of

86
00:03:28.75 --> 00:03:33.010
hundreds of smaller families the so

87
00:03:31.0 --> 00:03:35.170
called teep for a better understanding

88
00:03:33.01 --> 00:03:37.750
this was pretty similar to the Sicilian

89
00:03:35.17 --> 00:03:40.069
Mafia system everything stayed in the

90
00:03:37.75 --> 00:03:42.769
family

91
00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.840
and everything was done according to the

92
00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.120
principles of religion now in this case

93
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:49.159
Sunni Islam and the same way the

94
00:03:47.12 --> 00:03:51.319
Sicilian Mafia resisted all kinds of

95
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.140
invasions the Chechen cooking system

96
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.640
survived the SARS and even the Soviet

97
00:03:54.14 --> 00:03:59.900
Union must be Soviets in public and

98
00:03:58.64 --> 00:04:01.849
Muslims in private

99
00:03:59.9 --> 00:04:04.280
Chechnya proverb in other words during

100
00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.840
the Soviet era there were two parallel

101
00:04:04.28 --> 00:04:08.060
systems that were running at the same

102
00:04:05.84 --> 00:04:10.549
time on the surface there was communism

103
00:04:08.06 --> 00:04:13.579
that underground there was a hierarchy

104
00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.980
of Muslim clans and families this is why

105
00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.729
in the year 1991 when the Soviet Union

106
00:04:15.98 --> 00:04:18.739
disappeared

107
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.079
Chechens seized the opportunity and

108
00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.940
declared the Chechen Republic of a

109
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.139
carrier this name might ring about with

110
00:04:22.94 --> 00:04:30.979
you because it appeared in one of the

111
00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:32.630
call of duty video games now back then

112
00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.300
the president of the brand-new Russian

113
00:04:32.63 --> 00:04:37.729
Federation that was Boris Yeltsin and he

114
00:04:35.3 --> 00:04:42.590
replied to those rebels with military

115
00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.810
power Yeltsin declares emergency curfew

116
00:04:42.59 --> 00:04:47.539
in Chechen region nevertheless of this

117
00:04:44.81 --> 00:04:49.370
state of emergency failed entirely the

118
00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.830
Russian army was incapable of stopping

119
00:04:49.37 --> 00:04:54.680
the Chechen rebels and they had to run

120
00:04:51.83 --> 00:04:56.840
back home but not only that during their

121
00:04:54.68 --> 00:04:59.690
retreats the separatist rebels seized

122
00:04:56.84 --> 00:05:02.360
Russian weapons so three long years the

123
00:04:59.69 --> 00:05:07.190
Kremlin that put up with Chechnya but in

124
00:05:02.36 --> 00:05:09.870
the year 1994 well things they changed

125
00:05:07.19 --> 00:05:12.850
[Music]

126
00:05:09.87 --> 00:05:14.919
you can build a throne with bayonets but

127
00:05:12.85 --> 00:05:16.389
it's difficult to sit on it Boris

128
00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.009
Yeltsin you met what I told you about

129
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.110
the political system of Chechnya which

130
00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.180
was based on the tooken clan system well

131
00:05:20.11 --> 00:05:24.310
the truth is those different clans

132
00:05:22.18 --> 00:05:26.680
didn't really get on very well with each

133
00:05:24.31 --> 00:05:28.930
other and this was the start of a civil

134
00:05:26.68 --> 00:05:31.150
war a civil war that two Russian eyes

135
00:05:28.93 --> 00:05:33.400
was the perfect opportunity to take back

136
00:05:31.15 --> 00:05:35.440
control of the Republic however a year

137
00:05:33.4 --> 00:05:37.120
later the Russian army had lost 6,000

138
00:05:35.44 --> 00:05:38.919
soldiers and poor Boris Yeltsin had to

139
00:05:37.12 --> 00:05:41.169
sign a peace treaty with the separatist

140
00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.090
and pretty weak government of Chechnya

141
00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.960
meanwhile many Islamic terrorists from

142
00:05:43.09 --> 00:05:45.849
Saudi Arabia

143
00:05:43.96 --> 00:05:48.610
and Afghanistan fled to Grozny the

144
00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.740
Chechen capital to recruit new members a

145
00:05:48.61 --> 00:05:52.449
failed state with a tribal system where

146
00:05:50.74 --> 00:05:53.949
Islam is the official religion that

147
00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.780
sounds like a pretty great market for

148
00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.780
recruiting terrorists doesn't it

149
00:05:59.59 --> 00:06:03.900
[Applause]

150
00:06:01.43 --> 00:06:05.669
well in other words all of this meant

151
00:06:03.9 --> 00:06:08.910
that it was just a matter of time before

152
00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.100
another war began so this war it started

153
00:06:08.91 --> 00:06:13.500
in 1999 when a group of Islamic rebels

154
00:06:11.1 --> 00:06:16.169
invaded a neighboring Russian Republic

155
00:06:13.5 --> 00:06:18.030
the Republic of Dagestan so if making

156
00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.250
trouble in their own territory wasn't

157
00:06:18.03 --> 00:06:23.250
enough Chechens wanted to attack other

158
00:06:20.25 --> 00:06:25.410
parts of Russia now as you might imagine

159
00:06:23.25 --> 00:06:27.419
from this the Kremlin decided to send

160
00:06:25.41 --> 00:06:29.970
their troops immediately but this time

161
00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.979
it was pretty different so why was this

162
00:06:29.97 --> 00:06:33.840
well despite the fact Boris Yeltsin was

163
00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.539
the president this time the Prime

164
00:06:33.84 --> 00:06:37.949
Minister was the one and only the hero a

165
00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.910
visual politic and that would be

166
00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.910
Vladimir Putin

167
00:06:42.1 --> 00:06:46.270
well Putin he actually went there and he

168
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:47.650
found one of these separatists Chiefs

169
00:06:46.27 --> 00:06:50.410
and that would be mr.

170
00:06:47.65 --> 00:06:51.760
akhmad Kadyrov so basically Pisan went

171
00:06:50.41 --> 00:06:54.160
to this cataract eye and said alright

172
00:06:51.76 --> 00:06:55.630
dude look I'm gonna show you in gold I'm

173
00:06:54.16 --> 00:06:57.790
gonna give me as many weapons and as

174
00:06:55.63 --> 00:06:59.410
much power as you need you could do

175
00:06:57.79 --> 00:07:02.380
whatever you want there in Chechnya but

176
00:06:59.41 --> 00:07:05.590
there is only one condition no Wars no

177
00:07:02.38 --> 00:07:07.720
terrorism alright and as we say here at

178
00:07:05.59 --> 00:07:10.240
visual politic as it was said well so it

179
00:07:07.72 --> 00:07:12.130
was done the war it was over and CAD

180
00:07:10.24 --> 00:07:14.290
refused all that help from the Kremlin

181
00:07:12.13 --> 00:07:16.190
to destroy the other warlords in the

182
00:07:14.29 --> 00:07:18.550
Republic

183
00:07:16.19 --> 00:07:21.610
[Music]

184
00:07:18.55 --> 00:07:24.160
and now you might be wondering well did

185
00:07:21.61 --> 00:07:27.759
all of this work well the answers yes

186
00:07:24.16 --> 00:07:29.860
and sort of also no of course there were

187
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.900
no more Wars but many of those other

188
00:07:29.86 --> 00:07:33.729
warlords started organizing terrorist

189
00:07:31.9 --> 00:07:36.370
attacks in other areas of Russia

190
00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:38.560
including Moscow in the Moscow case a

191
00:07:36.37 --> 00:07:41.380
terrorist group kidnapped over 300

192
00:07:38.56 --> 00:07:44.229
hostages in a theater of those 300

193
00:07:41.38 --> 00:07:46.840
civilians a hundred and seventy died in

194
00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:49.300
other words Putin's plan was far from

195
00:07:46.84 --> 00:07:51.220
perfect and cataratas Authority was not

196
00:07:49.3 --> 00:07:53.050
taken for granted in fact some years

197
00:07:51.22 --> 00:07:55.690
later he would die in another terrorist

198
00:07:53.05 --> 00:07:57.819
attack in Grozny and well that was the

199
00:07:55.69 --> 00:08:05.710
moment when the main character of this

200
00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:09.009
story comes into the picture the

201
00:08:05.71 --> 00:08:11.259
Instagram star Ramzan Kadyrov succeeded

202
00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:13.659
his father in power and he learned a

203
00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:16.569
valuable lesson if you want to start a

204
00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.979
dictatorship you better make it big we

205
00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:19.479
are talking about a country full of

206
00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:22.030
warlords fighting each other where

207
00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:24.219
al-qaeda or - are recruiting people who

208
00:08:22.03 --> 00:08:25.690
might challenge cataratas power in other

209
00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:27.699
words he was not willing to let those

210
00:08:25.69 --> 00:08:29.710
weird Western fashions you know like

211
00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:32.079
democracy or human rights make him look

212
00:08:29.71 --> 00:08:34.270
weak besides he had PTIN support he had

213
00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:40.000
wealth he had weapons what more could he

214
00:08:34.27 --> 00:08:42.279
possibly ask for I owe my life to Putin

215
00:08:40.0 --> 00:08:44.529
if I ever forget this I am NOT a man

216
00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:46.600
when I went through a terribly hard time

217
00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:51.329
in my life he helped he is the most

218
00:08:46.6 --> 00:08:51.329
saintly man to me Ramzan Kadyrov

219
00:08:51.45 --> 00:08:56.140
the truth is since catarah came to power

220
00:08:54.25 --> 00:08:58.210
Chechen terrorists in other parts of

221
00:08:56.14 --> 00:09:00.850
Russia while they've disappeared but not

222
00:08:58.21 --> 00:09:03.310
only that al-qaeda and - militants are

223
00:09:00.85 --> 00:09:04.960
disappearing - cata Rob's police chases

224
00:09:03.31 --> 00:09:07.660
them expels them from the country with

225
00:09:04.96 --> 00:09:08.810
their families and then burns down their

226
00:09:07.66 --> 00:09:11.890
houses

227
00:09:08.81 --> 00:09:11.890
[Music]

228
00:09:12.16 --> 00:09:15.640
but if this was not enough cutter off

229
00:09:13.87 --> 00:09:17.710
soldiers offer themselves as volunteers

230
00:09:15.64 --> 00:09:19.570
for the most dangerous missions in

231
00:09:17.71 --> 00:09:20.290
Ukraine in fact in order to show his

232
00:09:19.57 --> 00:09:22.090
love for Putin

233
00:09:20.29 --> 00:09:24.100
Ramzan camera of organized the military

234
00:09:22.09 --> 00:09:26.230
parade at Cross knee football stadium

235
00:09:24.1 --> 00:09:29.850
thousands of soldiers were waving at the

236
00:09:26.23 --> 00:09:32.260
Chechen president ready to die for him

237
00:09:29.85 --> 00:09:35.110
if Putin tells me to get my army

238
00:09:32.26 --> 00:09:37.990
together I am ready rosna cutter off but

239
00:09:35.11 --> 00:09:40.000
things well they are not as sweet as

240
00:09:37.99 --> 00:09:42.130
they might seem actually with that

241
00:09:40.0 --> 00:09:44.380
military parade catarah was giving two

242
00:09:42.13 --> 00:09:46.480
messages one was hey Putin I'm your

243
00:09:44.38 --> 00:09:49.690
buddy but the other was hey Putin if you

244
00:09:46.48 --> 00:09:53.140
ever stop being my buddy come and get me

245
00:09:49.69 --> 00:09:54.820
if you dare yes dear viewer if Vladimir

246
00:09:53.14 --> 00:09:57.340
Putin ever wanted to confront his

247
00:09:54.82 --> 00:09:58.830
Chechen bestie it would be complicated

248
00:09:57.34 --> 00:10:01.790
to say the least

249
00:09:58.83 --> 00:10:03.650
[Music]

250
00:10:01.79 --> 00:10:05.570
and there are many signs this could

251
00:10:03.65 --> 00:10:07.460
actually happen in fact all of cataratas

252
00:10:05.57 --> 00:10:10.430
political foes they've been murdered

253
00:10:07.46 --> 00:10:11.690
regardless of where they were from

254
00:10:10.43 --> 00:10:13.100
journalists living in Moscow two

255
00:10:11.69 --> 00:10:15.470
political opponents hiding in some

256
00:10:13.1 --> 00:10:17.000
petersburg they've all been killed so

257
00:10:15.47 --> 00:10:19.300
what does this mean well it means the

258
00:10:17.0 --> 00:10:21.530
government of Grozny has its own KGB

259
00:10:19.3 --> 00:10:23.930
situated all across the country

260
00:10:21.53 --> 00:10:27.050
and well they're happy to use it anytime

261
00:10:23.93 --> 00:10:29.210
someone Chechen or not gets a little

262
00:10:27.05 --> 00:10:31.370
bit's bothersome so put it more

263
00:10:29.21 --> 00:10:33.830
poetically while Putin created Ramzan

264
00:10:31.37 --> 00:10:37.480
Kadyrov and now his creation has become

265
00:10:33.83 --> 00:10:37.480
big enough to look him in the eyes

266
00:10:38.44 --> 00:10:42.890
this explains why unlike other

267
00:10:40.88 --> 00:10:44.510
presidents of Russian republics catarah

268
00:10:42.89 --> 00:10:46.910
dares to give his opinion on

269
00:10:44.51 --> 00:10:48.470
international affairs and the Kremlin

270
00:10:46.91 --> 00:10:52.970
they pretend they don't see those

271
00:10:48.47 --> 00:10:55.070
horrific gay concentration camps Russia

272
00:10:52.97 --> 00:10:57.350
backs Chechnya government's denials over

273
00:10:55.07 --> 00:10:59.150
killing and torture of gay men meanwhile

274
00:10:57.35 --> 00:11:02.450
Chechnya is getting wealthier and

275
00:10:59.15 --> 00:11:04.790
wealthier thanks to Russia 90% of their

276
00:11:02.45 --> 00:11:06.440
wealth comes direct from money transfers

277
00:11:04.79 --> 00:11:08.270
from the Kremlin cut her off

278
00:11:06.44 --> 00:11:10.040
he's built a republic where the cult of

279
00:11:08.27 --> 00:11:12.500
aspersion ality is almost like a second

280
00:11:10.04 --> 00:11:14.240
religion just surpassed by Islam his

281
00:11:12.5 --> 00:11:16.430
Instagram account by the way has over 3

282
00:11:14.24 --> 00:11:19.370
million followers which is twice as many

283
00:11:16.43 --> 00:11:21.230
as the Chechen population and on this

284
00:11:19.37 --> 00:11:23.510
account you can see the lifestyle of one

285
00:11:21.23 --> 00:11:25.580
of the craziest dictators around and at

286
00:11:23.51 --> 00:11:27.260
the same time the only one that makes

287
00:11:25.58 --> 00:11:31.139
Putin afraid

288
00:11:27.26 --> 00:11:31.139

so now the question is will Vladimir's

291
00:11:35.99 --> 00:11:39.950
in and ramzan kadyrov ends up clashing

292
00:11:38.24 --> 00:11:42.200
should the Kremlin try to stop the human

293
00:11:39.95 --> 00:11:44.390
rights violations in Chechnya well
