Cambodia is far from an ordinary country

00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,550
it went through such a bad period that

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,470
this place became one of the poorest

ruthless histories of the entire

in 1975 the Cambodian Communist Party

took control of the country for the next

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,559
four years until its downfall in 1979

20
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,050
the chimeras as the party members were

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,090
known perpetrated one of the worst

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,280
genocides humanity has ever known during

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,440
the existence of democratic Kampuchea

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,440
three million people lost their lives

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,690
due to their policies that's a quarter

28
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,759
of the population of the entire country

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,860

execution of political dissidents and

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,700
racial and religious minorities made up

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,649
most of this chilling figure because

33
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,690
nobody was safe that Muslims Christians

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,790
Buddhists people of one ethnic group or

considered as an enemy of the revolution

39
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,130
yes the Khmer Rouge were crazy and of

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,960
course all of this crippled Cambodia's

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,640
development prospects for years to come

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,350
because how can you possibly recover

43
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,450
from something so horrendous as you can

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,550
imagine it was no easy task and yes

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,930
that's exactly what we're going to talk

46
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,420
about in this video today how cambodia

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,220
has changed since the fall of communism

48
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,200
both in the economic and political

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
fields we're also going to look at what

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,739
we can expect from this small Asian

51
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,330
country in the future because it's

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,250
located in one of the areas of the world

53
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:24,300
that has the most potential a 100%

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,870
dependent economy Cambodia has

55
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,120
experienced impressive exponential

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,350
economic growth in recent years between

57
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,280
1997 and 2017 its GDP has grown every

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,140
year at an average of seven point seven

59
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,330
percent its gdp per capita is multiplied

60
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,130
by more than three

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,700
these are excellent numbers but what

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,650
exactly has such development translated

64
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,190
into well for example this huge economic

65
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,569
growth has meant that the population

66
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,040
living below the poverty line has

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,630
decreased from approximately 50 percent

68
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,239
to just over 13 percent and of course

69
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,280
with this date so you may think well Wow

70
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,260
things seem to be going really great in

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:25,310
Cambodia well yes and no the truth is

72
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,870
that right now the country is

73
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,300
experiencing what you could call a great

74
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,670
uncertainty it sits between China and

75
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,590
the Western actors that United States

76
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,600
and the European Union but let's look at

77
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,610
this step by step

78
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,740
we've already seen the Cambodian

79
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,510
economy's enormous growth in the last

80
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,370
two decades so that raises the question

81
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,640
what exactly does Cambodia offer what is

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,209
their economic model based on

83
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,310
while the answer here is simple the

84
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,659
textile industry and tourism the

85
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,459
powerful Cambodian textile industry

86
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:06,409
accounts for approximately 80% of the

87
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:08,530
country's exports and employs more than

88
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,569
700,000 people this industry is by far

89
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,489
the country's driving force in the main

90
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,349
source of income for many Cambodian

91
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,489
families by the way Cambodia has a

92
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,259
feature that is seriously harming its

93
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,150
developments and it could also be a huge

94
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,620
problem for its future Cambodia is still

95
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,380
a mostly rural country us than 25% of

96
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,060
the population lives in cities which

97
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,490
places it as one of the least urbanized

98
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,110
countries on the planet to give you an

99
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,060
idea of what this figure means its

100
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,150
neighbor Lao is nearing 40 percent under

101
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,400
these conditions access and provision of

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,380
educational services are very expensive

103
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,449
and difficult to manage most rural

104
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,699
schools don't have books or an internet

105
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,740
connection and people continue to look

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,020
to the countryside as a way of life this

107
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,150
explains why approximately 20% of the

108
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,770
adil population is illiterate well let's

109
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,960
not get off-topic the fact is that a

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,760
large part of Cambodia's economic

111
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,830
takeoff was due to another character a

112
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,110
protagonist who arrived with a huge wad

113
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,930
of bills and stacks of bricks under his

114
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,789
arm you want to know who's hiding behind

115
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:24,759
this sudden deluge of investments

116
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,770
well no surprises that would be China

117
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,930
China has spent hundreds of millions of

118
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,819
dollars in infrastructure and in

119
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,229
real-estate developments in Cambodia

120
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:37,909
it's very common to see a landscapes

121
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,370
full of cranes and imposing buildings

122
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,740
and skyscrapers under construction in

123
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,409
the last two years alone about 6,000

124
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,909
construction projects valued at more

125
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,919
than 11 billion dollars have been

126
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,930
approved and he has most of the buyers

127
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,639
in this promising new real-estate market

128
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,349
come from China typically between 50 and

129
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,629
80% of the properties of the most

130
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,580
luxurious real estate developments in

131
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,860
the capital pnom Penh are required by

132
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,090
Chinese but just a second because what

133
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,669
triggered such fervor are the Chinese

134
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:16,280
crazy about Cambodia well maybe but

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,629
there's another compelling reason the

136
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,919
poor supervision that Cambodia

137
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:20,690
implements on the source of money

138
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,190
invested as well as its lacks

139
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,229
regulations has led many Chinese

140
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:26,449
millionaires to use Cambodia as a refuge

141
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:27,259
for their money

142
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,610
you know in case things go a bit

143
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,349
pear-shaped in China but of course

144
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,659
there's two sides to every coin and in

145
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,759
this story it's certainly no different

146
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,949
so far we've seen the attractive face

147
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,260

[Music]

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,200
hunson China and the death of democracy

150
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,400
we've already told you what's happening

151
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,560
in the Cambodian economy but we can't

152
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,630
forget Hun Sen the country's Prime

153
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,670
Minister and a major player in Cambodian

154
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,150
news you see hunson was one of the main

155
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,340
opponents of the chimeras Maoist regime

156
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,530
and reached power in 1979 with the

157
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,420
Vietnamese invasion the Britain ends to

158
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,370
democratic Kampuchea and the horrors of

159
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,780
the Khmer Rouge led by Pol Pot since

160
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,100
then hunson has ruled the country

161
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,320
becoming seconds on the list of longest

162
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,510
ruling leaders second only to equatorial

163
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,980
Guinean leader Teodoro Obiang and so

164
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,960
what can I say at first glance the fact

165
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,220
that a ruler has been in power for so

166
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,320
long doesn't look good right

167
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,650
[Music]

168
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,719
the fact is that in 1993 Hong's an

169
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,669
approved a new constitution that at

170
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,560
least on paper would democratize the

171
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,879
country by turning it into a

172
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,500
constitutional monarchy with a

173
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,360
multi-party system that could allow for

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,740
a democratically elected prime minister

175
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,250
however 26 years have passed and well

176
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,259
there's still no trace of democracy the

177
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:56,389
Constitution exists but there's no

178
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,039
opposition because the regime itself

179
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,599
doesn't allow it and in recent years

180
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,080
things have actually got worse in the

181
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,780
local elections of June 2017 the

182
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,879
opposition party national rescue of

183
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,310
Cambodia achieved significant popular

184
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,590
support however their droid in last Lok

185
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,060
the Supreme Court controlled by the

186
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,620
Prime Minister ordered the dissolution

187
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,539
of the opposition party and the

188
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,879
imprisonment of its leader kam Sokka in

189
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,099
November the reason as is often the case

190
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,750
the opposition was accused of planning

191
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,879
an uprising after the illegal ization of

192
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,979
the opposition and the imprisonment of

193
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:29,659
soccer which led to other opposition

194
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,169
leaders going in to XR her Hansen regime

195
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,310
demonstrated that the political freedoms

196
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,010
promulgated by the 1993 Constitution

197
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,110
where I came down to it nearly cosmetic

198
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,660
but such a disregard for democracy and

199
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,860
political freedoms would have

200
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,060
consequences

201
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,550
US House passes bill to sanction

202
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,880
Cambodia's top officials you begins

203
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,680
process to hit Cambodia with trade

204
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,170
sanctions and it's precisely this that

205
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,630
can hurt Cambodia the most European

206
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,730
Union's trade sanctions although in

207
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,680
reality it's not about sanctions but

208
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,720
about Cambodia's withdrawal from the

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,210
European all but arms program a program

210
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,010
that benefits the poorest countries by

211
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,600
giving them access to the European

212
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,580
market through tariffs exemptions which

213
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,890
has greatly helps the Cambodian textile

214
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,210
industry to develop but of course in

215
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,710
order to profit from these commercial

216
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,690
advantages certain conditions have to be

217
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,880
met and one of them is securing human

218
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
rights and political and democratic

219
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,520
freedoms and it's precisely because of

220
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,860
Hansen's violation of these principles

221
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,510
that the EU is immersed in the process

222
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,640
of expelling Cambodia from this

223
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,470
initiative this expulsion may jeopardize

224
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,540
a good part of Cambodia's textile

225
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,490
production whose exports to the European

226
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,260
Union account for about 6 billion

227
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,620
dollars which in turn equates to 40% of

228
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,390
the country's total exports

229
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,850
and of course in the face of such a

230
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,220
threats the logical thing is for humson

231
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,290
to take a step back what do you think

232
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,779
well the thing is no nothing could be

233
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:00,589
further from the truth

234
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:02,089
hunson has not only reaffirmed his

235
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:03,769
position but he's blamed the European

236
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,959
Union for meddling in internal affairs

237
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,209
but hold on a second because if Hansen

238
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:09,769
doesn't really care about the sanctions

239
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,440
and this check on the Cambodian economy

240
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,360
is the Prime Minister condemning the

241
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,140
country to disaster

242
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,760
[Music]

243
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,760
well perhaps but the truth is just a bit

244
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,660
more complicated

245
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,699
what Hansen really has in mind is

246
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,829
decreasing their dependence on the west

247
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,360
by turning to China

248
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,399
moreover relations with Beijing is so

249
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,870
good that the support is mutual

250
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,550
see while China floods the Cambodian

251
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,560
regime with Aden investments Cambodia

252
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,779
supports China in the ASEAN resolutions

253
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,820
which condemn Beijing's military and

254
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,589
territorial expansion in the South China

255
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:50,139
Sea and just a second because that's not

256
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:53,170
all China reportedly signs secret deal

257
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,570
to stationed troops in Cambodia with all

258
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,940
this one thing is very clear Hun Sen has

259
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,699
become a Beijing man and is turning his

260
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,980
back on the West and he's just the

261
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,720
latest player to do so but now it's your

262
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,100
turn what do you think about China

263
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,529
wielding its power in Southeast Asia by

264
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,630
clashing its checkbook even at the cost

265
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,790
of humming political freedoms should Hun

266
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,070
Sen retract and remain more neutral

267
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,810
towards the West and China well leave

268
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,029
