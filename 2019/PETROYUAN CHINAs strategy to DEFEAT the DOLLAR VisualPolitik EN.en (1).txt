Kublai Khan's court the first emperor of

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,299
the yuan Chinese dynasty and grandson of

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,630
Genghis Khan himself

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,790
there he founds what was probably the

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,980
first fiduciary currency of all time a

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,050
currency that was entirely based on the

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,760
government's reputation and the threat

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
of a harsh and certain punishment for

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,380
those who refuse to use it

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,560
I love China the biggest bank in the

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,210
world is from China

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,160
what's going on with China is

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,910
unbelievable the largest devaluation in

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,100
two decades you know where they're the

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,410
United States headquarters is located in

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,379

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,050
China

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,160
because even though in recent centuries

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,810
the world of finance has been chiefly

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,850
dominated by the West the pound sterling

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,620
in the United States dollar becoming

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,360
hegemonic for more than 200 years we're

25
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,160
forgetting that it was the Chinese back

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,050
in the seventh century who developed one

27
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,390
of the greatest financial innovations in

28
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,220

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,229
regain that leadership but of course in

30
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,540
order to do so they have to do one thing

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,420
and that of course is defeat the US

China in the United States have an

almost overwhelming rivalry the

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,979
difference between the two is huge and

38
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:37,960
of course it favors the North American

39
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,670
power in practically every field

40
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,829

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,110
is the second largest economy and the

45
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,090
largest exporter in the world in spite

46
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,860
of all of this however its own currency

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,110
the one doesn't really have much

48
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,119
international clout and hold on a sec

49
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,590
because I can guess what you're probably

50
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,310
thinking

51
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,140
yep the Chinese yuan has been used more

52
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,909
in recent years due to the Chinese

53
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:06,490
economy's huge growth but let's not fool

54
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,289
ourselves we aren't willing to convert

55
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,390
our savings into you are an in the same

56
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,459
way that many people do with dollars and

57
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,080
certainly drug traffickers aren't

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,239
willing to be paid in briefcases full of

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:25,299
Chinese currency in other words in

60
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:26,260
practice the you'ens

61
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,090
importance at an international level

62
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,400
remains pretty insignificant or at least

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,549
that was until now because folks in this

64
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,170
video we're gonna talk to you about how

65
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,120
Xi Jinping's government wants to end the

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,650
dollars dominance and make the yuan

67
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,630
reflect the economic weight of the

68
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,310
Chinese giant and you know what this is

69
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,260
a lot to do with the fact that China has

70
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,299
already surpassed the United States as

71
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,460
the world's biggest oil importer

and now you are wondering well yes I'm

75
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,740
in but I mean what does the yuan what's

76
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,420
got to do with oil well we're gonna get

77
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,280
to that soon but first we need to go

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,180
back in time about 45 years we have to

79
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,120
go to the 1970s maybe you've heard about

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,450
the petro dollar the time has come for a

81
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,040
new economic policy for the United

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:29,040
States the petro dollar the story of a

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,730
pact since the Second World War and the

84
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,769
Bretton Woods agreements of 1944 the

85
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,330
dollar has been the reference currency

86
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,160
the leading world currency if you are

87
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,200
indeed the dollar is by far the most

88
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,030
commonly used in the international

89
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,070
currency market indeed two-thirds of all

90
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,690
of the world's central bank's reserves

91
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,690
are in dollars and almost 40% of all

92
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:56,130
debt issued globally is in US dollars in

93
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,260
other words nowadays the dollar is like

94
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,239
the oxygen of the global economic system

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,430
any country will have a very hard time

96
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,530
moving forward if they can't get some

97
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,420
dollars however there was a period in

98
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,000
history where this ecosystem almost

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,329
collapsed

[Music]

101
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,430
this'll happens on August the 15th 1971

102
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,800
when Richard Nixon announced the ends of

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,080
the dollars convertibility I have

104
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,580
directed the Secretary of the Treasury

105
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,700
to take the action necessary to defend

106
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,040
the dollar against the speculation I

107
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,570
have directed secretary Connolly to

108
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,980
suspend temporarily the convertibility

109
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,190
of the dollar into gold or other reserve

110
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,820
assets except in amounts and conditions

111
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,750
determined to be in the interest of

112
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,790
monetary stability and in the best

113
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,850
interest of the United States before

114
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,200
then the dollar was a convertible

115
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,060
currency that is the different central

116
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,070
banks could convert it into gold this

117
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,139
means you could tell the Federal Reserve

118
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,060
Area dollars now give me the equivalent

119
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,370
value in gold the problem was that the

120
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,350
Korean War the Vietnam War and numerous

121
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,180
public spending plans were adding up so

122
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,130
the Federal Reserve issued many more

123
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,080
dollars than they had goals to back it

124
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,669
up

125
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,200
but with Nixon's decision all of this

126
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,910
ended and the dollar became a fully

127
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,520
fiduciary currency

128
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,289
well the thing is that this decision

129
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:27,940
which was announced as a temporary

130
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,800
measure and then became permanent risked

131
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,539
the people's faith in the dollar up

132
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,250
until then the dollar had been the

133
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,560
benchmark currency but from then on why

134
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,389
would anyone accept some paper that the

135
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,220
Federal Reserve could simply printer

136
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,610
will the French president himself

137
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,110
General Charles de Gaulle had already

138
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,539
stated his concern in 1965 even before

139
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,520
the dollars convertibility was abolished

140
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,819
check this out the fact that many

141
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,340
countries accept as a principle dollars

142
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,009
as good as gold leads Americans to get

143
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:59,349
into debt and to get into debt for free

144
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,780
at the expense of other countries

145
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,360
because what the u.s. owes them it is

146
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,300
paid at least in part with dollars they

147
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,819
are the only ones allowed to omit

148
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,729
Charles Dougal but folks faced with the

149
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,169
risk that the global monetary system

150
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,030
could collapse if the dollar was the

151
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,770
reference currency the United States

152
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,349
found a formula to save and consolidate

153
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,270
the dollars hegemony of course during

154
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,390

156
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,050
you see in 1974 the United States and

157
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,909
Saudi Arabia they agreed that all oil

158
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:39,520
purchases would be done in US dollars

159
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,349
and not only that the reserves of the

160
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:42,879
money generated would be channelled

161
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,680
through the North American financial

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
system which of course is run with

163
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,729
dollars and this this is how the petro

164
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,849
dollar was born a year later 1975 the

165
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,889
other OPEC countries joined in and dear

166
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,569
viewer we're talking about the oil

167
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,819

170
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,520
in other words Saudi Arabia essentially

171
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,289
came to the dollars rescue which of

172
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:09,669
course they didn't do for free Saudi

173
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,530
Arabia's ruling family wanted nothing

174
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,870
less than absolute protection from the

175
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,190
United States something like a

176
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,560
comprehensive insurance plan bit of a

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,719
spoiler alert if they absolutely got

178
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,000
that you probably knew that the Saudi

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,550
led operations are fully US backed

180
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,550
trying to bring stability to Yemen but

181
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,590
the US has its own fight

182
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,730
as we told you here before a visual

183
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,680
politic in exchange for receiving every

184
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,790
kind of protection from the North

185
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,010
American military first Saudi Arabia and

186
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,870
then the other OPEC countries promised

187
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,120
to flood the United States with money

188
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,830
and cheap oil

189
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,289
but I know I'm sure that at this point

190
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,879
some of you might be wondering well what

191
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,830
good does this do for the United States

192
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,930
well the dollar is in such huge demand

193
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,449
as the worldwide reference currency for

194
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,039
trade savings and investments that it

195
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,810
has allowed the United States for

196
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,849
example to print money to finance the

197
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,169
government's without generating

198
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,840
inflation or affecting their economic

199
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,070
stability

200
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,670
and not only that the dollars present

201
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,320
throughout the world has also favored

202
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,880
the United States as they've been able

203
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,590
to create more developed financial

204
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,000
markets they've been able to have more

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,620
buyers for their debt securities and

206
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,660
they've been able to secure the current

207
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,370
importance of Wall Street but we talk

208
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,900
extensively about all of that in another

209
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,880
video I'm going to link to that in the

210
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,400
description below the point is that now

211
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,410
the Chinese the world's biggest oil

212
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,479
importers want to flip around this

213
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:51,820
established order the petrol one

214
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,940
[Music]

215
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,190
a visual politic we already talked to

216
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,590
lots about the New Silk Road well we

217
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,570
could say that this is another of the

218
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,980
great products which the Chinese

219
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,750
government is currently working on

220
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,970
pretty intensively see in June of 2017

221
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,770
Beijing took the first step when it

222
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,720
agreed with Russia that oil purchases

223
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,790
could be made in you want thus was born

224
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,850
what is known as the petrol yuan this is

225
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,620
a form of sale that is now being used in

226
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,390
many of the oil deals that China makes

227
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,240
with Russia Iran Angola and Venezuela

228
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,260
however the truth is that countries

229
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,030
haven't been eager to accept this

230
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,440
currency why is this well that's because

231
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,870
it's considered a liquid rather risky

232
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,910
highly volatile and not exactly a

233
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,470
reliable currency well to overcome this

234
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,290
reluctance in March 2018 China announced

235
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,540
a new twist oil futures contracts they

236
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,770
were launched on the Shanghai

237
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,900
International Energy exchange under a

238
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,360
yuan denomination but first a quick note

239
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,280
a futures contract is an agreement that

240
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,350
forces the contracting parties to buy or

241
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,690
sell an assets in this case oil for a

242
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,670
fixed price that is agreed on today

243
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,260
despite the fact that the delivery of

244
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,990
said asset of the oil in this case will

245
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,280
be made in the future this is our

246
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,200
companies and governments can organize

247
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,940
themselves and know how much oil they'll

248
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:18,640
be able to buy at a predetermined price

249
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,320
but that's not all to reassure sellers

250
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,760
China announced that the yuan

251
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,950
denominated futures would be backed by

252
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,720
gold in other words the country that

253
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,400
sells the oil will be able to exchange

254
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,710
the yuan it receives for gold whenever

255
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,020
it wants to this this is a pretty

256
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,580
attractive deal than you think

257
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,990
this is another detail the countries

258
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,450
that charge in yuan can also escape the

259
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,340
US sanctions the pace of expansion has

260
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,340
been explosive the shanghai contract has

261
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,620
become an unexpected thorn in the side

262
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,740
of the main Western benchmarks Steven

263
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,110
Ennis head of asia-pacific trading at

264
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,770
futures brokerage Oh Wanda in Singapore

265
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,940
obviously there's still a long way to go

266
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,470
before it can catch up with Western

267
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,510
markets but so far reception seems to

268
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,900
have been well rather good

269
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:17,840
[Music]

270
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,150
so with this new framework in place do

271
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,430
you know what China is doing exactly

272
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,110
it's pressuring their suppliers to

273
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,050
accept charging for oil in yuan oh and

274
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,460
if you don't want to accept that you're

275
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,900
on wells I'm worried about it I'm just

276
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,390
gonna buy less oil from you no problemo

277
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,760
in fact this explains exactly why China

278
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,529
has prioritized countries such as Russia

279
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,750
and Angola as its oil suppliers in

280
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,500
recent years

281
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,180
[Music]

282
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,040
but that's not all China knows that

283
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,930
Saudi Arabia could play a major role in

284
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,120
this entire process if this country even

285
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,280
partially accepted the yuan the entire

286
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,290
global monetary order would totally

287
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,510
change news stories like these that have

288
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,940
longer just about energy security but

289
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,220
about financial and political strategies

290
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,320
check this out

291
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,840
Saudi Aramco agrees to Chinese JV deal

292
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,820
for ten billion dollar refinery could he

293
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,640
imagine if the Saudi oil that Aramco is

294
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,650
going to supply to this new refinery was

295
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:23,710
paid in yuan this folks is the move with

296
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,660
which Beijing wants to end the dollars

297
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,850
importance or at least weaken it

298
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,920
China is buy more and more oil each time

299
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,690
than they're paying for a great part of

300
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,940
it in yuan and this has many many

301
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,020
implications for example China's oil

302
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,760
suppliers will have more accounts and

303
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,860
reserves in yuan with which they won't

304
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,930
only buy Chinese technology and products

305
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,850
but the surplus will be heavily invested

306
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,890
in China itself and government debt in

307
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,930
the real estate sector in stocks when

308
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,120
they are released etc etc in other words

309
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,890
China wants to have all of the benefit

310
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,930
that the United States has enjoys in

311
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,090
recent decades China wants the petrol

312
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,460
you want to contribute decisively to its

313
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,530
national development strategy far beyond

314
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,880
the export sector

315
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,770
all the while pressuring their main

316
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,730
rival

317
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,540
[Music]

318
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,070
now hold on just a moment because China

319
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,470
will have to introduce many reforms to

320
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,480
achieve these objectives not only will

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
they have to give more freedom to

322
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,750
foreign investors they'll also have to

323
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,870
give them more legal security because

324
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,279
let's be honest if you have to save

325
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,330
money right now you're probably not

326
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,730
gonna be doing it in a Chinese bank but

327
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,860
