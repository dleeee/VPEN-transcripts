[Music]

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,389
India is the world's largest movie

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:11,610
producer we've all heard of Bollywood

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,929
but let me ask you a question

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,150
what's the second largest movie producer

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,620
what comes after India

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,410
[Music]

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,890
the answer is Nigeria yep I'm sure

10
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,779
almost nobody guessed that right but my

11
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,730
dear viewers so-called Nollywood

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,859
produces more titles a year than

13
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,750
Hollywood itself but of course nobody

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,370
knows this because Africa is the

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,530
Forgotten continent African politics and

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,300
economics hardly appear in the

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,100
newspapers and this is why we can say

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,170
that Africans are witnessing a silent

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,899
miracle until the 2000s this region it

20
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,180
seemed completely dude but since the

21
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,489
beginning of the new century Africans

22
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,710
have tripled their income countries like

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,220
Ethiopia are growing at a rate of 10%

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,640
year after year

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,789
[Music]

26
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,410
and I know what you're going to tell me

27
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,699
you're gonna say what come on Simon

28
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,369
these are just statistics is life really

29
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:08,470
changing for the average African look if

30
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,780
you're expecting to see skyscrapers and

31
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,479
caravans of BMWs on the streets of

32
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,670
Nairobi then yes you are going to be

33
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,090
disappointed we're not there yet in fact

34
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,740
there are still regions of the continent

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,539
stark and extreme poverty that would be

36
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,039
the case with the People's Republic of

37
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,020
Congo and the Central African Republic

38
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,659
this other regions are improving for

39
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,149
example at us over the ethiopian capital

40
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,369
is starting to get some supermarkets

41
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,409
this might seem like a rather trivial

42
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,810
thing to you but it's a giant step if

43
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,580
you remember that 30 years ago the whole

44
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,080
country was going through one of the

45
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,390
worst famines in history hold on a

46
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,759
minute because there's even more we are

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,950
starting to see how African companies

48
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,350
are expanding internationally for

49
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,530
example Ethiopian Airlines or m-pesa a

50
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,130
mobile phone payment platform

51
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,990
so now you might be wondering why is

52
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,000
Africa growing like this what has

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,979
changed in the continent and the answer

54
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,890
is clear and that's peace you see the

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,300
first requirement for a country to

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,220
develop is not do have to fight in wars

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,500
after that we can discuss political

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,020
systems tax policies or whatever but a

59
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,840
society that lives on a battlefield can

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,790
hardly prosper but now things are

61
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,959
starting to change

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,239
is that true sounder absolutely Simon

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,250
for decades Africa was a really violent

64
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,380
continent wars for independence tribal

65
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,200
clashes genocide today while violent

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
conflicts do still exist around the

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,709
continent from Libya to the say hell to

68
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,660
the Democratic Republic of Congo the

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,400
conflicts are less frequent or at least

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,950
smaller in scale for example in the year

71
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,130
1990 an average of forty five 400,000

72
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,410
Africans died in violent conflicts today

73
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,390
this figure has dropped to about eight

74
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,730
per 100,000 and of course this has

75
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,410
helped encourage trade and foreign

76
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,760
investment especially from China

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,980
nevertheless as we said before there is

78
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,350
still a lot of work to be done Africa is

79
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,720
far from being a prosperous region they

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,180
need to take the next step ins or what's

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,060
that well that would be

82
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,040
industrialization so far Africa remains

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,140
a rural consonant except for a few

84
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,940
exceptions everything you can buy in

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,130
Africa is a raw material and it's hard

86
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,170
to grow a modern economy based on

87
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,209
agriculture and mining so this is the

88
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,600
context in which this news takes place

89
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,260
[Music]

90
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,260
the largest free trade deal in nearly a

91
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,629
quarter century seeks to make Africa a

92
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,519
single market yep you had that right the

93
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,049
goal of this treaty is to make an

94
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,909
African version of the European single

95
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,280
market which was the seed for what we

96
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,260
know of today as the European Union

97
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,049
since May the 30th 2019 this treaty has

98
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,540
been a reality we're talking about 52

99
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,640
countries who have signed us in fact

100
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,920
only Benin Nigeria and Eritrea have

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,680
refused to enter these so-called f-c FTA

102
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,530
or just C FTA so now the question is can

103
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,390
this treaty change things or is it just

104
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,480
a bunch of nice words can a free-trade

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,549
agreement really improve lives in Africa

106
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,280
and why doesn't Nigeria the country with

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,470
the largest African economy want to sign

108
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,180
it well today we're going to answer all

109
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,890
of these questions but before we do

110
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,070
let's take a look back at the history

111
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,510
market no industry when we talk about

112
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,510
Africa we should remember one thing 55

113
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,030
countries 1.3 billion people we

114
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,560
shouldn't really talk about Africa like

115
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,389
it's a country then again there is one

116
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,310
thing that most of the African countries

117
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,770
have in common their colonial past most

118
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,450
of these nations have been independent

119
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,700
for less than 50 years and believe me

120
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,039
they still maintain their bonds with

121
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,050
their previous colonizers in many ways

122
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,419
the idea of Independence is kind of a

123
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:46,310
delusion look in a normal country the

124
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,440
main trading partner is that country's

125
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,539
neighbors American trades with Mexico

126
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,669
and Canada France trades with Germany

127
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:54,500
Germany trades with the Netherlands but

128
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,539
African countries are different animals

129
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:58,940
in this regard for example Ivory Coast

130
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,550
is neighbouring garner and Liberia but

131
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,830
who is Ivory Coast's main trading

132
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,110
partner no it's not either of their

133
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,729
neighbors their main trading partner is

134
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,440
the Netherlands and France which

135
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,479
surprise surprise is its former

136
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,100
colonizer

137
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,429
[Music]

138
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:18,079
and of course this trend is changing but

139
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,819
not in the way you might expect if

140
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,019
you've been following visual politic for

141
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,029
a long time you already know that China

142
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:25,279
has been increasing its sway in Africa

143
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,959
over the past several years and it's not

144
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,459
only the Asians that are playing a role

145
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:34,010
here just look at this news

146
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,840
China's coming slow down opens doors to

147
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,389
expanding African trade with India but

148
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,980
not only that over the last 15 years

149
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,870
trade with Africa has tripled with other

150
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,910
countries like Turkey and Indonesia

151
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,850
today Asia represents 45 percent of the

152
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,950
African foreign trade Europe is 30

153
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,530
percent so as you can see there's only a

154
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,590
little share for inter-african trade and

155
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,389
I know what you're thinking right now

156
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,760
you're probably thinking so what I mean

157
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,440
don't we live in a globalized economy I

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,210
mean what's the problem with trading

159
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,000
with Asia or Europe well it is a problem

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,980
think about it what does Europe or Asia

161
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,590
buy from Africa yep you guessed it raw

162
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,530
materials like oil gas gold and uranium

163
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,990
in other words everything you accept

164
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,570
manufactured goods and there is a good

165
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,800
reason for this let's look at an example

166
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,900
[Music]

167
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,540
Rwanda motorcycle company was born in

168
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,680
2017

169
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,780
they manufacture low-cost motorbikes

170
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,910
would you buy one of those probably not

171
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,400
their bikes are no match for Suzuki or

172
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,680
Honda so Asian and European countries

173
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,620
tend to not opt for a Rwandan model when

174
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,030
they could have a Japanese or American

175
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,880
one instead so where could Rowan's and

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,010
motorcycles find markets and of course

177
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,810
that's in other African countries in

178
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,000
fact Africa is a great place for them

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,280
because there are almost no competitors

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,710
if you live in Congo good luck finding a

181
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,110
BMW sharp to buy a bike from so in many

182
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,820
countries these Rwandan entrepreneurs

183
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,340
have a big blue ocean of market

184
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,650
opportunities to exploit this explains

185
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,290
why despite African countries trading so

186
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,730
little with each other most of the

187
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,070
things they trade are manufactured goods

188
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,660
in other words if Africa wants do you

189
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,760
have industry they need to trade with

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,640
each other more so what's the problem

191
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,500
here the problem is that things in

192
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,000
Africa are never easy

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,980
and trade is harder than anything there

194
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,540
are lots of tariffs and lots of

195
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,980
bureaucracy that makes it almost

196
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,930
impossible for local companies to cross

197
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,540
borders if you want to send your Rwandan

198
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,760
motorcycle to neighbouring Congo you'll

199
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,040
have to pay tariffs up to 20% but you'll

200
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,110
also have to bribe the guard at customs

201
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,450
otherwise your merch could be waiting

202
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,520
there for months

at this the insecurity the gangs and the

205
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,020
warlords that are still present in many

206
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,160
regions and you've got a bit of a

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,600
problem don't forget that just a few

208
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,880
years ago many of these countries were

209
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,530
killing each other citizens

210
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,050
so again bike manufacturer in Rwanda can

211
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,419
hardly survive with a small and poorer

212
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,220
market as the local one if they want to

213
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,860
survive they need to expand to their

214
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,020
neighbours in other words protectionism

215
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,630
is making it almost impossible of Africa

216
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,190
to develop the pay attention now because

217
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,930

African Union Blood Diamond is a

220
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,040
Hollywood movie that talks about how we

221
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,139
can end up killing each other just for

222
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,360
some precious minerals the conclusion of

223
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,969
this movie is that the West just wants

224
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,039
Africa's resources and nothing more

225
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,469
presented with this situation many might

226
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,089
think that Africans can't get themselves

227
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,250
together and they need a good old

228
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,680
Western helping hands but of course this

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,170
is visual politic and you know we think

differently British story has been

dark side his motto country is Singapore

237

fan of democracy or human rights but

239
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,990

dream is to turn Africa into a single

earlier in this video the African

255

continental free trade agreements their

256
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,440
ultimate goal is to have a common

currency for the whole continent

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,520
something similar to the euro but in

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,620

have free trade agreements and then we

268
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,180
have free trade agreements an example of

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,800
in South Africa has it worked well the

272
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,410
answer is no the countries who signed

273
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,509
this document were not willing to cede

274
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,220
sovereignty nobody was willing to

275
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,990
promote Arif sand let's their local

276
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,000
companies compete with foreign ones the

Mercosur treaty is full of exceptions

278
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,920
yes it has nice words in it but when you

279
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,319
look at the reality they realized that

280
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:40,509
the trade between its members hasn't

281
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,699
really increased something similar could

282
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,769
happen with the African free trade area

283
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,569
for example the main African economies

284
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,579
South Africa and Nigeria are not big

285
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,829
fans of this South Africa signed at the

286
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,129
last minute but Nigeria well this is

287
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:59,600
what my dear sir

288
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
see FTA I won't allow Nigeria to be a

289
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,530
dumping ground Muhammadu Buhari

290
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,810
president nigeria basically many

291
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,160
governments are reluctant to lose

292
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,140
control of the small industries they

293
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,030
already have besides their main income

294
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,340
is what they collect in tariffs don't

295
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,110
forget that in a country like Nigeria

296
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,840
there is no big and regulated job market

297
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,120
so it's hard to collect income tax in

298
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,010
most cases African governments get their

299
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,780
money from the only thing they can

300
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,610
control and that's foreign trade but

301
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,860
there is more to this the CFT a treaty

302
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,110
generates as many doubts as it does

303
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,150
hopes you see a treaty like this usually

304
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,090
takes decades to negotiate this one it

305
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,940
was done in only four years and in their

306
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,530
desire to have as many countries as

307
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,360
possible they've left lots of things off

308
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,760
of the negotiation table

309
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,880
final documents is vague and generic it

310
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,320
doesn't say anything clear about

311
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,329
competition causes investments or

312
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,250
intellectual property rights there is no

313
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,110
list of what goods you can trade freely

314
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,899
ins which ones will be protected in Siri

315
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,550
they have committed to removing tariffs

316
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,620
on 90% of the products over the next

317
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,779
decade of course governments can push

318
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,209
the most important goods inside of that

319
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,730
10% so if you only liberalize trade on

320
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,410
the goods that you don't actually sell

321
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,510
then you don't really have free trade

322
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,610
but hold on a second because there are

323
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,040
many many more problems of course the C

324
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,990
FTA would be wonderful as a way to

325
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,209
incentivize the emergence of new

326
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,329
industries but so far Africa relies

327
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:30,519
heavily on agriculture and to what to

328
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,949
African farmers think well many of them

329
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:39,070
are not exactly happy smugglers thrive

330
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,440
as Nigeria tries to keep foreign rice

331
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,110
away in this case Nigeria is afraid of

332
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,540
neighboring the neem the neem has become

333
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,790
a big importer of Thai rice apparently

334
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,230
Thai rises high quality and affordable

335
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,750
if Nigeria suddenly opens trade with

336
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,940
Benin its local rice producers might

337
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,100
have a hard time this is where the big

338
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,529
time dilemma comes in should we risk the

339
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,660
agriculture that we have already in

340
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,029
exchange for would be brand new

341
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,709
industries or do we just leave

342
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:11,020
everything as it is

343
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,270
and this is the real debate according to

344
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,580
the United Nations if the CFDA turns out

345
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,260
the way it was meant to inter-african

346
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,600
trade could grow 52 percent in the year

347
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,630
2022 this is only three years after the

348
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,279
year that we made this video but of

349
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,570
course if the member countries keep

350
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,700
adding exceptions and mistrusting each

351
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,089
other

352
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:31,100
we could end up with a Merck assort kind

353
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,050
of thing in other words our friends from

354
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,910
the Rwandan motorcycle company would

355
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,650
keep struggling to open markets

356
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,110
elsewhere and remember with no market

357
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,680
there is no industry at all so the

358
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,720
question now goes to you do you think

359
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,150
the C FTA will go in a European Union

360
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,130
like direction or will it go with a more

361
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,920
murca source style also should Nigeria

362
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,600
sign it well we witnessed the

363
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,160
