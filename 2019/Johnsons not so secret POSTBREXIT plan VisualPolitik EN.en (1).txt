3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,960
brexit is like nuclear power everyone

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,519
has an opinion about it but almost

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,980
nobody knows how it really works

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,650
too many brexit means the UK isolating

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,449
themselves from the rest of the worlds

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,820
but brexit supporters think the exact

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,189
opposite that brexit means globalization

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,939
and open markets on steroids check this

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,099
out year's Bors Johnson is planning to

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,610
turn UK into Singapore on fames after

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,460
breakfast in 2019 the phrase Singapore

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,160
on Thames became a sort of mantra for

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980
many brexit ears as you know Singapore

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,450
is one of the main hubs for

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,370
international trade they have free

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,559
market deals with nearly everyone and

19
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,870
their laws have attracted thousands of

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,030
companies according to Boris Johnson the

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,160
European Union is blocking the UK from

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,440
becoming as free and as open as

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,690
Singapore is and there is some truth to

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,340
this

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,229
[Music]

26
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:08,049
no I haven't gone nuts think about it

27
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,659
for a moment the EU is the biggest free

28
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,000
market area in the world thanks to this

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,310
there are 28 countries that can't read

30
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,500
with each other and yes it is true that

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,689
the EU has very few tariffs when it

32
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,340
comes to foreign trade but it's also

33
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,829
true that the years Brussels has been

34
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,929
cheating in the international free trade

35
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:31,640
market

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,420
yeah the flea uses Colombia WTO over

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,110
fries

38
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,270
yes you heard that right we're talking

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,010
about French fries Europe has been

40
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,380
selling french fries to Colombia for

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,410
years so far so good the EU and Colombia

42
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,660
have a free trade agreement so everybody

43
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,660
is happy so what's the problem the

44
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,820
problem comes when Brussels heavily

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,490
subsidizes European farmers thanks to

46
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,100
see ap grants producers can sell under

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,680
market price to the Colombians at ads

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,050
this the EU food regulations which tend

49
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,610
to be stricter than elsewhere and you

50
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,459
can understand why Colombian farmers can

51
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,319
hardly compete with European ones

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,569
many of you might think that the French

53
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,359
fry is a stupid example but we can find

54
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:22,180
the same issue in a much much bigger

55
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,909
industry the battle between the American

56
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,700
Boeing and the European Airbus it

57
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,219
follows the very same principle and here

58
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,780
we're talking about something much more

59
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,700
serious than just some chips

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,230
[Music]

61
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,930
lesson poses record 7.5 billion dollar

62
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,300
tariffs on European goods in other words

63
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,370
the United Kingdom wants to stay away

64
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,980
from all these trade wars in order to do

65
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,550
that

66
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,130
Johnson's post brexit plan would be to

67
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,040
sign free trade deals with anyone deals

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,260
that would allow the UK to trade with

69
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,959
the whole world without restrictions all

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,989
of this it sounds beautiful but there's

71
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,900
a bit of another problem here time

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,160
negotiating a trade deal between two

73
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,430
countries can take years so the UK will

74
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,500
need more than a decade to see the

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,110
singaporean dream come true if it ever

76
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,110
does and well what would happen in the

77
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,470
meantime is a big question

78
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,080
the UK it would have to trade with the

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,030
world according to the World Trade

80
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,150
Organization rules which are not that

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,280
convenient so if you're watching this

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,800
video from brexit plans then you'd

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,270
better get ready for lots and lots of

84
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,400
tariffs while your government negotiates

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,490
something a bit better maybe not what if

86
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,500
there was an easy quick and handy

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,890
solution to all of this well yes Boris

88
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,470
Johnson has a not-so-secret plan to have

89
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,990
free trade without negotiations I'm

90
00:03:51,990 --> 00:04:01,500
talking about this Boris Johnson whitens

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,230
pushed for singapore-style free ports in

92
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,260
UK exactly the so-called supercharged

93
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,720
free ports these ports would work as

94
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,420
islands of free trade in the middle of

95
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,510
the UK here is an example imagine that

96
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,100
we have a Colombian ship full of

97
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,720
potatoes and we want to sell those

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,450
potatoes in the UK let's assume that the

99
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,360
tariffs would be 30% but now imagine

100
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,970
that instead of loading your merchants a

101
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,760
Liverpool you do it in a supercharged

102
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,100
free port in the port of Tyne near

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,040
Newcastle initially you pay no tariffs

104
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,660
very close to the port there is a

105
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,030
factory that can process these potatoes

106
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,430
cut them into chips freeze them and put

107
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,860
them into bags and this factory is built

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,370
on special Freeport land so far you

109
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,800
haven't paid any tariffs whatsoever

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,620
besides the taxes here are very low and

111
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,419
there is freedom of movements there's no

112
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,210
border control no customs Jack's nothing

113
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,710
[Music]

114
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,510
and once we have the frozen french fries

115
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,150
we sell them to the UK market this is

116
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,130
when you have to cross the border that

117
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,290
limits the area of the supercharged

118
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,050
Freeport however you are now already in

119
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,660
the UK when you have to pay the tariffs

120
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,640
today good news unlike raw potatoes

121
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,910
frozen fries have only a 10% tariff so

122
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,800
now the Colombians have paid less

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
tariffs you've secured some jobs and

124
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,700
you've bypassed a lot of trade

125
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,710
restrictions it all sounds pretty easy

126
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,690
doesn't it I mean it just sounds like a

127
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,350
great idea then well why didn't the UK

128
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,360
do it before why does the UK

129
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,270
need to be out of the European Union in

130
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,159
order to do this well today we're going

131
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,259
to answer all of those questions but

132
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,810
before we do let's take a look back at

133
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:52,770
the history matchers lace

134
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,419
if you ever travel to London there is a

135
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,659
place you can't miss Canary Wharf it's

136
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,490
one of the most modern neighbourhoods in

137
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,680
the town with a whole lot of skyscrapers

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,439
and even a funicular Canary Wharf is one

139
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,509
of the world's financial hubs and this

140
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,400
is surprising given that the area in the

141
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,909
1970s was extremely poor back then this

142
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:13,740
region had of course the Isle of Dogs

143
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,440
port and they had a big problem during

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,569
the 70s merchant ships started getting

145
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:19,379
bigger and bigger

146
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,659
indeed eventually they couldn't fit in

147
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,210
to the Isle of Dogs port so year after

148
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,430
year they had lasting less traffic in

149
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,250
the 70s this area was marginalized but

150
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,090
things changed in 1982 back then the

151
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,770
British prime minister was the woman you

152
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,960
see on the screen now Margaret Thatcher

153
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,240
that wrote was a big fan of businesses

154
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,250
so in order to restore this neighborhood

155
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,259
she had an idea she turns it into a

156
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,750
so-called enterprise so basically this

157
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,090
area would have lower taxes and much

158
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,879
more flexible times the government would

159
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,529
make sure it was well connected with

160
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,839
public transport and ropes all of this

161
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,460
was enough to convince a lot of

162
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,529
developers to come here and build office

163
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,750
buildings and today Canary Wharf is a

164
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,240
skyscraper forest it makes lots of money

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,190
and employs thousands of highly skilled

166
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,580
workers

167
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,380
in other words the experience was good

168
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,420
so good that Thatcher repeated it over

169
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,640
and over again during the 80s the United

170
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,260
Kingdom started opening more and more

171
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,510
enterprise zones with lower taxes if

172
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,160
this wasn't enough they also gave

173
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,350
licences to some ports to become free

174
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,900
ports with no tariffs whatsoever this is

175
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,910
our missin opens their New Castle

176
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,980
factory near the port of Tyne that

177
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,590
employs 7,000 people so what's the

178
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,540
problem well these two great examples I

179
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,700
just gave you some of the few that

180
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,130
really worked out in most cases these

181
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,960
special economic zones didn't generate

182
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,550
as much growth as Thatcher thought

183
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,040
according to many studies 40% of the new

184
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,320
jobs they created were just relocated

185
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,120
ones this means instead of brand new

186
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,710
companies and brand new jobs being

187
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,080
created businesses for other areas moved

188
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,210
into the enterprise zones so the net

189
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,430
result was actually zero but beyond this

190
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,260
the government had to spend lots of

191
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,850
money on infrastructure to make the

192
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,380
enterprise zones really attractive to

193
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,940
businesses just to give you an example

194
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,070
Canary Wharf has its own Airport London

195
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,530
Central so basically for each job that

196
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,480
was created with this policy the

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,750
government spent 17,000 pounds in 2012

198
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,130
the United Kingdom stopped giving

199
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,410
licences to these zones no more tax

200
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,020
breaks no more tariffs free ports so now

201
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,420
you might wonder if the idea was so bad

202
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,120
why do they want to do it again why are

203
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,220
you so excited about it well let's have

204
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,909
a look

205
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,820
[Music]

206
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,280
hard breaks of therapy while the UK lost

207
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,780
its faith in these special economic

208
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,000
zones the European Union did the you

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
might not know but today Europe has more

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
than 80 special economic zones with

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,080
lower taxes and lower or no tariffs for

212
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,940
example if your Colombian friends want

213
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,830
to unload their french fries in the port

214
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,660
of Cadiz in southern Spain they would

215
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,970
pay no tariff they can then store those

216
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,040
tasty tasty fries in the port for as

217
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,780
long as they want of course as soon as

218
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,920
they want to sell it in Spanish

219
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
territory they cross a beautiful border

220
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,390
with some customs Jackson they pay the

221
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,450
tariff

222
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,580
but if they just store the fries because

223
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,350
eventually they want to send a tube say

224
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,290
Morocco they pay no tariffs whatsoever

225
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,780
to Spain so now you might wonder if this

226
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,310
is already happening in Europe

227
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,100
why does Boris Johnson need brexit to do

228
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:36,870
it well here's the reason the treaty on

229
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,610
the functioning of the European Union

230
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,370
passed in 2007 is one of two primary

231
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,610
treaties of the European so what does

232
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,230
this treaty say among many other things

233
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,880
it says that these special economic

234
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,160
zones could be created for two purposes

235
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,860
one helping a poor region to develop or

236
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,710
to boosting a specific type of industry

237
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,050
like green energy or something like that

238
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,120
all of this explains why most of these

239
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,430
80 zones are placed in Eastern Europe

240
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,190
Croatia has 11 free zones while Austria

241
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,500
and the UK have none and this makes

242
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,240
sense because the wealthiest Croatian

243
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,920
region has eleven thousand four hundred

244
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,010
euros of GDP per capita meanwhile the

245
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,750
Newcastle area one of the poorest

246
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,810
regions of the UK has 35,000 euros of

247
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,000
GDP per capita I think it's pretty clear

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,140
who needs the most help right so yes and

249
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,030
of course from an EU perspective the UK

250
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,220
does not need special economic zones but

251
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,690
if we look at it from a British

252
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,000
perspective we can see how there are big

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,730
differences between regions

254
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,920
[Music]

255
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,109
Weston in a London as a GDP per capita

256
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:43,779
of a hundred and ninety one thousand

257
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,119
euros so as you can see compared with

258
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:48,160
London the northern regions are much

259
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,889
poorer and economics is sometimes a

260
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,749
matter of comparison in fact these

261
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,119
poorer regions are we're brexit is so

262
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,579
popular and all of this explains why in

263
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:59,859
this area of the country this Freeport

264
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:06,009
idea sounds like heaven to mail-order

265
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:08,949
tide wants virtual Freeport stretching

266
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,529
to Nissan Factory in Newcastle but the

267
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,509
question remains the same special

268
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,819
economic zones didn't do marvels in the

269
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,519
80s so why would they do marvels now and

270
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,009
this is when we get to the idea of the

271
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,290
supercharged free ports basically in the

272
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,149
80s we had two types of special economic

273
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:27,790
zones enterprise zones with some tax

274
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,249
breaks and free ports with no tariffs

275
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,470
imagine what would happen if we merge

276
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,869
these two things into one what we have

277
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,939
we have a place with freedom of movement

278
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,209
low taxes flexible urban regulations and

279
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,179
no tariffs boom all of a sudden we can

280
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,980
make the story of the Columbian

281
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,410
french-fry make possible they come with

282
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,970
their raw ingredients they unload it

283
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,739
they processes and they sell it with

284
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:52,869
lower tariffs in the meantime we have

285
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:54,879
created companies factories and jobs for

286
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,679
lots of people in the poorest areas of

287
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,720
the country it sounds pretty good and in

288
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,029
the north it sounds really good free

289
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,850
ports plan for North could give UK 9

290
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,129
billion pound boost according to a

291
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,139
consultancy named the mace group filling

292
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,819
northern England with these supercharged

293
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,679
free ports would create over a hundred

294
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,569
and fifty thousand jobs as you can

295
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,309
imagine the port associations in the

296
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,759
country are enthusiastic about this idea

297
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,189
conservatives a b2 and labor is pretty

298
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:26,470
divided on the national level they say

299
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,970
this

300
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,010
mores Johnson's reports are for the

301
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,860
super-rich to dodge taxes and launder

302
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,430
money

303
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,350
nevertheless the northern English Labour

304
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,870
MPs art is clear just look at what my

305
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,350
kill an MP from Manchester says my kill

306
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,600
for jobs in northern coastal towns

307
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480
create supercharged free ports so now

308
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,070
the question is are we really talking

309
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,920
about the last resort for post brexit UK

310
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,980
can these free ports really work so far

311
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,360
it looks as though they have more

312
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,520
advantages than disadvantages but we're

313
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,680
not talking about a game-changer at all

314
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,900
can they create jobs of course they can

315
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,210
definitely in Newcastle where the Nissan

316
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,280
Factory is based they could be a great

317
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,170
incentive for other car manufacturers to

318
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,730
set up assembly plants they could also

319
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,590
import the cars piece by piece and then

320
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,540
put them together in the UK this could

321
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,940
provide some jobs but not really highly

322
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,470
skilled ones at the end of the day

323
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,570
assembly is one of the cheapest parts of

324
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,200
the value chain of a product

325
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,439
[Music]

326
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,970
but anyway we're just making predictions

327
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,100
and that's not our job so now the

328
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,019
question goes over to you do you think

329
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,970
these supercharged Freeport's are going

330
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,069
to turn the UK into a Singapore on tense

331
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:43,050
with this make up for the losses of a

332
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,120
heart brexit please leave your answer in
