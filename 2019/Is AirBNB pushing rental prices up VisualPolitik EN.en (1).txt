00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,400
a B&B is one of the fastest-growing

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,410
startups when it comes to international

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,690
expansion to get a better idea of how

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,240
crazy fast their growth is air B&B was

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,859
founded in California in February of

7
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,140
2009 just three years later in February

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,449
of 2011 seventy-five percent of their

9
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:24,400
business was from outside of the United

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,529
States Inga Barisan Facebook needed

11
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,810
twice as much time to consolidate their

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,440
international presence

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,960
no matter where you're watching this

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,330
video from I'm sure you have used air

16
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,220
B&B at some point just in the last

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,020
decade the website has registered over

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,020
400 million check-ins believe me when I

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,150
tell you that not many companies can say

20
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,490
they've changed an entire industry the

21
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,220
way air B&B has and done it in so little

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,940
time

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,350
in theory the idea could it be more

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,660
brilliant a B&B allows everybody to turn

25
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,310
his or her house into a hotel

26
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,870
thanks to this a lot of people are able

27
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,000
to travel for way less money but not

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,739
only that it has also created a brand

29
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,360
new generation of small business owners

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,850
today hundreds of people worldwide live

31
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,800
off their earnings from Airbnb in fact

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,390
according to many studies Airbnb has

33
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,729
created more jobs than it has destroyed

34
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,259
but hold on a minute because not

35
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:17,720
everything is sunshine and rainbows if

36
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,700
you thought that the Airbnb revolution

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,500
is no negative consequences well you

38
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,280
better think again activists took over

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,740
Airbnb headquarters in San Francisco to

40
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,970
protest evictions

41
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,710
exactly throughout the world cities

42
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,440
platforms against Airbnb are surfacing

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,600
in fact we'll soon see how many cities

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,090
are banning or restricting Airbnb but

45
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,369
the question is now why is that the case

46
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,649
well many people complain for two

47
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,600
reasons one is they don't want to have

48
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,250
tourists in their neighborhood they

49
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,869
complain about the noise and the mess

50
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,759
that the tourists make but the biggest

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,340
reason is the alleged increase in rental

52
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,229
prices then believe me this can be a

53
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,850
serious problem I'm sure many of you

54
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,440
know what I'm talking about there's this

55
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,149
global trends and that's what most of

56
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,470
the world's biggest cities are

57
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,270
experiencing a rise in rental prices

58
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,700
that just keeps getting higher Zander is

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,810
now gonna give us some more information

60
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,819
about this of course Simon you see

61
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,759
cities like LA or San Diego experienced

62
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,910
rent increases more than 15%

63
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,860
[Music]

64
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,660
the same goes for other cities like

65
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,030
Memphis or Reno but this is not just an

66
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,130
American thing in Berlin rents have

67
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,450
doubled in ten years

68
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,310
the same is happening in Madrid and

69
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,830
Barcelona and the question is for why

70
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,020
why rents getting so expensive but it

71
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,390
makes sense to believe that air B&B has

72
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,320
something to do with it

73
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,540
maybe it's not the only factor but it

74
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,970
could be a very important one at the end

75
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,770
of the day owners can make much more

76
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,810
money from tourists than they can from

77
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,870
tenants according to Ed DNA cleverly

78
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,640
named analytics website that analyzes

79
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,740
tourism rentals the average price for a

80
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,230
night in Barcelona is 187 euros the

81
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,870
average occupancy 81 percent with these

82
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,640
figures in hand an owner in the city

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,370
could make up to be 5,000 euros a year

84
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,550
in Spain it's a pretty high salary

85

[Music]

86
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,320
in other words with fewer flats for rent

87
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,930
prices go up it's just supply and demand

88
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,640
people but truth be told it's really

89
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,920
hard to study this topic why because

90
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,380
it's hard to find reliable data in order

91
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,810
to prepare this video we spent literally

92
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,180
more than two months doing our research

93
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,730
and finally we use two sources academic

94
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,440
studies some of which have data straight

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,590
from Airbnb and that website err DNA

96
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,390
that said I want to thank your nan tal

97
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,640
from several University in Prague for

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,350
helping us I also want to thank err DNA

99
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,760
for providing us with all the data we

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,260
need it may be some of the numbers we've

101
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,060
been using a not extremely accurate

102
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,100
these were the most precise numbers that

103
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,959
we could come up with so on so today's

104
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
question that is how much is Airbnb to

105
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
blame for rent prices going up well

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,170
today we will answer this question but

107
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,700
first a history

108
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,340
[Music]

109
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,950
cities against Airbnb once upon a time

110
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,590
two guys sharing a flat in San Francisco

111
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,420
couldn't pay their rent so what did they

112
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:04,840
do

113
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,610
well aired an empty room so they decided

114
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,560
to rent it to tourists back then was a

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,540
conference in the city so they decided

116
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,069
to turn their spare room into a small

117
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,569
bed-and-breakfast for people attending

118
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,040
the conference because the only mattress

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,600
they had was an inflatable one they

120
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,980
called the website they eventually

121
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,980
created Airbnb and this idea it couldn't

122
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,860
have gone any better

123
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,020
so these guys decided to share their

124
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,129
idea with the rest of the world

125
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,379
initially the idea was to host tourists

126
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:31,699
at their house for money

127
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,409
in fact even today there are a lot of

128
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,180
people who can pay their mortgage thanks

129
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,490
to putting a room up on Airbnb but the

130
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,169
story it doesn't stop here as soon as

131
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,639
this platform was born many people

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,349
realized there was more business to be

133
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,909
made here think about it if you can make

134
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,770
money with a room what why not rent the

135
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,199
entire flat this is how an unexpected

136
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,930
trend was born owners renting an entire

137
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,030
apartment tourists and make no mistake

138
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,790
this approach is not in the minority

139
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,469
[Music]

140
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:02,960
according to Airbnb 56% of the offerings

141
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,909
in New York our entire apartments in

142
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:07,490
Barcelona these listings make up 57% and

143
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,210
in Los Angeles

144
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,430
it's almost 70 percent so you might be

145
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,629
thinking well how is this all possible

146
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,610
managing an Airbnb apartment it's got a

147
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,990
job in itself you got to make

148
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,060
renovations the flat you got to keep it

149
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,099
clean give the keys to the guests I mean

150
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,599
if you're the owner and you don't have a

151
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,340
lot of time well sounds like it's gonna

152
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,969
be a problem

153
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,229
but don't worry good news there are

154
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:25,550
companies out there that will manage

155
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,949
your B&B for a bit of a commission

156
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,360
Thanks so there's all of the cities

157
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,710
around the world have been filled with

158
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,810
thousands of Airbnb apartments to get a

159
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,699
better idea of just how numerous these

160
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,949
listings are in Barcelona alone there

161
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,789
are more than 20 1800 Airbnb s all right

162
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,460
so it kind of sounds like a lot but how

163
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,440
much is that really well in 2011

164
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,449
Barcelona had a hundred and seventy

165
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,580
seven thousand houses for rent now in

166
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,729
2019 there might be more but let's use

167
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,199
2011 as a reference we could save that

168
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,699
around twelve percent of residential

169
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,310
houses are now for tourists and this

170
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,390
this is where the controversy starts

[Music]

172
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,800
Barcelona finds a way to control its

173
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,470
Airbnb market but we aren't just talking

174
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,230
about Barcelona for example in 2016

175
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,360
Berlin passed a bill that banned a B&B

176
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,790
throughout the entire city basically in

177
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,410
order to host tourists you had to ask

178
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,300
for a license from City Hall and those

179
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,000
were very restricted with fines as high

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,340
as a hundred thousand euros and 2018

181
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,290
they softened this legislation today

182
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,410
access is still very limited

183
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,540
[Music]

184
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,000
have an Airbnb property but if you want

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,010
to have a second property you have a

186
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,260
90-day limit something similar is

187
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,050
happening in LA New York and Japan yes

188
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,940
you have that right the entire country

189
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,680
of Japan has put a limit on Airbnb

190
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,600
listings and now you might be wondering

191
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,540
well is Airbnb really influencing rents

192
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,080
in the cities and the answer well is yes

193
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,240
absolutely but that's the wrong question

194
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,700
the real question is how much is it

195
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,370
affecting rental prices and this is

196
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,220
where we enter the beautiful world of

197
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,410
nuance you see the world's most serious

198
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,060
study that we have on this topic was

199
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,440
conducted by the University of

200
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,870
California in 2018 they researched

201
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,390
Airbnb --zz impact in the city of Boston

202
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:21,510
lands here's that conclusion we show

203
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,390
that a 1% increase in Airbnb listings is

204
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,420
causally associated with a 0.01 8%

205
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,190
increase in rental rates while these

206
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,410
effects may seem very small consider

207
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,600
that Airbnb is year-over-year average

208
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,300
growth is about 44% the study focused on

209
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,950
Boston but let's extrapolate those

210
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,020
numbers to Barcelona again this is not

211
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,790
going to give us an accurate figure at

212
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,070
all but it should at least help us with

213
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,290
an approximation using the data from air

214
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,240
DNA we know that the flat offerings for

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,950
tourists in the city have increased by

216
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,250
22% since 2016 this means that Airbnb is

217
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,010
contributed to a 0.44% increase

218
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,810
nevertheless rents in Barcelona have

219
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,760
raised by 11% in the same period

220
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,320
so how is this possible how is it

221
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,390
possible that Airbnb has had such a

222
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,970
small effect on rental rates well let's

223
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,840
check that out now

224
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,430
[Music]

225
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,560
airbnb x' biggest myths while we did the

226
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,940
research for this video we called a

227
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,610
friend who owns an air B&B in Malaga

228
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,350
which is a very touristy city in Spain

229
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,630
he makes an average of five thousand

230
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,520
euros a month this is a pretty decent

231
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,860
salary for Spain so right now everyone's

232
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,600
probably thinking well a B&B is got to

233
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,300
be a pretty solid business right I mean

234
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,450
why not start doing yourself well not so

235
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,670
fast cowboy things are just not that

236
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,030
easy

237
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,740
imagine you have a flat in New York City

238
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,200
and you rent it out on everything

239
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,420
everybody wants to spend New Year's Eve

240
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,700
in Times Square so in December you make

241
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,680
a good chunk of money but you know then

242
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,630
you have January and February and city's

243
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,350
pretty empty

244
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,790
don't worry though you'll compensate for

245
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,200
it with the summer earnings right

246
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,910
somebody's big time for tourism

247
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,000
everywhere and yes this is true but hold

248
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,769
on another minute because you aren't the

249
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:04,329
only one who came up with that idea and

250
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:05,889
summer everyone is putting their flats

251
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,500
on Airbnb for example in February 2017

252
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,769
New York had 8,500 listings in December

253
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,889
those went up to 19,000 beta in February

254
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,290
2018 it went down again so now do you

255
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,579
see what's going on here having these

256
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:21,100
strengths is at the same time its

257
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,620
biggest weakness there are just no

258
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,320
barriers to entry everybody can start an

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,139
Airbnb business and this explains news

260
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,290
like this

261
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,820
[Music]

262
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,130
Airbnb host sir having a hard time

263
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,350
gouging guests for the Super Bowl in

264
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,390
this case we're talking about the 2016

265
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,520
Super Bowl which was celebrated in Santa

266
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,510
Clara California

267
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,220
all of a sudden thousands of football

268
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,990
fans were willing to pay whatever it

269
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,880
took in order to spend a night in the

270
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,980
city hotels were full so thousands of

271
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,630
owners decided to list their flats for

272
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,460
tourists just a weekend's rent could be

273
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,170
enough to pay a month's salary so who

274
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,940
would want to do that right but that was

275
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,740
the thing everybody did it so supply

276
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,660
saturated the demands and prices went

277
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,020
down

278
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,420
this explains why despite the way things

279
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,270
look prices have been stabilizing since

280
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,100
2017 of course there is seasonality at

281
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,930
different times of the year but July

282
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,510
2017 was not that different from July

283
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:23,210
2018 or July 2009 T and yes having a

284
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,400
hotel can be a hell of a business that

285
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,950
tourists are not infinite so if you were

286
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,330
thinking of jumping into the Airbnb

287
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,120
bubble I have bad news for you the

288
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,580
golden times are over at least in the

289
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,740
cities where we had access to data Los

290
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,170
Angeles New York and Barcelona does this

291
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,880
mean that you can't make money on Airbnb

292
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,490
anymore well absolutely not and if you

293
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,350
have nightmares about cities full of

294
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,150
Airbnb listings and no more flats

295
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,700
Durin's well you can sleep soundly there

296
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,290
doesn't seem like this is gonna happen

297
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,510
anytime soon but wait a minute because

298
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,050
there's something else if you look at

299
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,030
these maps there's something you might

300
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,910
notice yes there are Airbnb listings in

301
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,440
all of the neighborhoods for example on

302
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,030
the snap of New York you can see how all

303
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,100
of Manhattan is covered in offerings but

304
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,290
Queens and the Bronx are almost empty

305
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,330
and this is not all do you see now there

306
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,850
are two types of bulls on the map you'll

307
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,680
see that are purple ones and there are

308
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,750
blue ones the purple ones are entire

309
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,160
listings and the blue ones are

310
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
individual rooms if you pay attention

311
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,640
you'll see a clear pattern the further

312
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,710
we get from the center the less purple

313
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,569
and the more blue there is

314
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:31,550
so yes in the most touristy areas which

315
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,709
are also the most expensive owners would

316
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,959
rather rent to tourists but the further

317
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,819
you get from those areas the more often

318
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,649
people use Airbnb to get some extra

319
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,749
income that being said where does Airbnb

320
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:43,399
have the biggest impact of course it's

321
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,679
not in middle-income or poor areas a B&B

322
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,199
impacts the prices a B&B has the biggest

323
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:50,059
impact on rent prices in the most

324
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,499
expensive neighborhoods and this

325
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:57,259
explains news like this papers of San

326
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,269
Antonia in Barcelona had been complained

327
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:01,189
for years about tourism in order to

328
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:03,350
illustrate this point a civil platform

329
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,929
has created a quote map of shame that

330
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:07,910
points out some of the tourist flats in

331
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,470
the neighborhood in this case sent

332
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,019
Antonio is a neighborhood in the center

333
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:12,980
of Barcelona

334
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,350
if Airbnb as a general impact of 0.4

335
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,910
percent on the rental price perhaps the

336
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,589
figure is higher here so in conclusion

337
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,329
there are many reasons to doubt that

338
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,179
Airbnb has such a huge impact on rental

339
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,889
prices of course there are many other

340
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,660
externalities that we could discuss but

341
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,119
rent increases are not one of them but

342
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,589
the question that we still haven't

343
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,559
answered is if not a B&B what is driving

344
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,420
rent increases in the world's biggest

345
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,279
cities and well we're going to answer

346
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,110
that in a future video we don't want to

347
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,299

bell button meanwhile I'm the only view

350
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,790
of the question why are Enterprises

351
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,769
getting so expensive how can we solve

352
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,569
this issue well please leave your answer
