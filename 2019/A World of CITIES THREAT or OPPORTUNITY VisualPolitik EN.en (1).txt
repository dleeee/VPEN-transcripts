made possible by Nord VPN data security

a foreign person living somewhere with

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,469
in the EU or the US nor VPN they're

console politick or click the link in

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,659
the description below and let's get into

35
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,200
it

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,500
[Applause]

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,720
let me ask you a question which do you

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,229
prefer the country or the city okay so

39
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm sure your answer is going to depend

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,979
on what sort of activity you have in

41
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,310
mind if we want to spend a few days away

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,170
from the hustle and bustle of the city

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,840
would probably choose the countryside

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,320
[Music]

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,320
but if instead we think about day to day

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,090
life undertaking her own business

47
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,310
projects or going on a night out the

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,630
answer is probably going to change

49
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,960
completely don't fool yourself we all

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,450
like cities and that's got consequences

51
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,070
for the first time ever in history more

52
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,750
than half the world's population lives

53
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,700
in cities

54
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,870
[Music]

55
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,819
cities have emerged as the nuclei in

56
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,770
which people completely unknown to each

57
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,560
other and of various origins coexist and

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,990
coordinate their lives to fulfill their

59
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,209
goals who hasn't felt amazed by the

60
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,280
hustle and bustle of London of New York

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,830
of Tokyo it's a huge mix of cultures

62
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,230
religions nationalities cities are made

63
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,180
up of very different people but many

64
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,800
have something in common and that's the

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,709
desire to grow as a society and it's

66
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,090
pretty amazing without thinking about it

67
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,010
or in many cases without even being

68
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,410
aware of it we contribute to the welfare

69
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,360
of a lot of people we don't even know

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,700
and they do the same in return by

71
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,860
providing a lot of services that we need

72
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,590
it is precisely for this reason folks

73
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,570
that cities have been consolidated as

74
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,030
the axis the nucleus the engine in the

75
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,820
freest and most prosperous human society

76
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:18,780
model that humanity has ever known

77
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,730
but does the growth of cities today pose

78
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,160
a threat to the rural world our cities

79
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
meeting the needs of their residents and

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,379
how is global urbanization affecting

81
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,480
people's lives well let's take a look

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,860
shall we from the countryside to the

83
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,780
city from the countryside to the city

84
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,970
I'm sure many of you have grandparents

85
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,099
or great-grandparents who were born and

86
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,950
lived in a village because the migration

87
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,569
from the countryside to the city has

88
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,620
been a relatively recent phenomenon you

89
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,510
all know this historically humans lived

90
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,340
scattered in small communities where

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,769
life was based on subsistence farming

92
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,480
and whatever products they were able to

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,760
produce if you were lucky you might have

94
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,260
your own plot of lands where you'd raise

95
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,030
a few animals and plant a few vegetables

96
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,980
which you later consume

97
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,930
as you can imagine life was very very

98
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,340
hot people spent their lives working

99
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,440
from childhood to try and get ahead

100
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,720
often with no chance of ever securing a

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,060
better life and what's more the risk of

102
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,450
external factors making life worst was

103
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,880
extremely high

104
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,620
for example drought or flood could lead

105
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,450
to a terrible famine that could end the

106
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,700
lives of thousands upon thousands of

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,370
people not to mention Wars invasion and

108
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,590
of course disease that's why among other

109
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,720
things mortality it was so high in the

110
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,950
past so would you like to go back to the

111
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,710
good old days probably not right I mean

112
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,660
don't get yourself in 99% of cases

113
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,600
things that were much worse in general

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,580
cities offer us a higher quality of life

115
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,850
and a range of opportunities

116
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,100
it all began with industrialization back

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,260
in the 18th and 19th centuries which

118
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,320
also led to a boom in trade and

119
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,170
technological innovations

120
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:10,610
[Music]

121
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,690
[Applause]

122
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,850
in that era cities began to grow

123
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,040
exponentially by attracting millions of

124
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,630
people from the countryside who wanted

125
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,610
to improve their living conditions and

126
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,280
that's the definition of urbanization

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,230
massive transfer of people from the

128
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,150
countryside to the city that has been

129
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,580
happening continuously for more than two

130
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,240
centuries it's a process that has

131
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,340
allowed many completely new economic

132
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,260
activities to flourish improving

133
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,150
everyone's lives since as recently as

134
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,310
the 1960s the world's urban population

135
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,380
is multiplied by 4 while the rural

136
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,480
population has grown very slowly and has

137
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,480
almost reached its tipping point it's

138
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,150
estimated the between 2025 and 2030 the

139
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,950
world's rural population will begin to

140
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,930
shrink for the first time in the history

141
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,330
of mankind so far it's decreased in

142
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,430
relative terms but now it will also

143
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,270
begin to do so in absolute terms

144
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:19,889
[Music]

145
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:22,389
basically we live in a world of cities

146
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,849
now how might this change affect us well

147
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,129
obviously in order to live we need goods

148
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,409
to be produced in the countryside's in

149
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:33,219
particular food and this leads us to a

150
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,319
big question that comes up every once in

151
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,029
a while and that's cannae world of

152
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,039
cities feed the planets growing

153
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,169
population does this urbanization

154
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,019
process threaten our food security now a

155
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,019
lot of people say yes but we're not so

156
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:54,969
sure so a question we need to ask

157
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,789
ourselves is are we producing food in

158
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,009
the same way we did 50 years ago the

159
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,889
short answer's no we're not nowadays we

160
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,349
don't need 10 20 or 30 farmers to plow a

161
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,019
couple of hectares of land john deere 80

162
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,490
to 85 our ore is just more than enough

163
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,179
[Music]

164
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:18,089
this has a name you probably heard

165
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,529
mechanization this is new technologies

166
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,779
being used which incidentally tend to be

167
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,369
developed in the cities and they've

168
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,349
brought tremendous improvements to the

169
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:28,449
rural environments improvements that's

170
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,860
of course translate into a better

171
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,479
quality of life and the countryside

172
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,429
mechanization has greatly reduced the

173
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:35,349
number of workers required in the fields

174
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,019
not only maintaining but even increasing

175
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,249
agricultural production

176
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:44,169
that's exactly why Malthusian theories

177
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,819
the theories that claim the world is

178
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:47,710
suffering from overpopulation that we

179
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,059
don't have the resources to feed

180
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:51,759
everyone fail over and over and over

181
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,330
again

182
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,159
however hold on a second folks because

183
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,990
as you might imagine this population

184
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,629
explosion creates many many challenges

185
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,490
in the cities especially in developing

186
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,589
countries the main one is urban poverty

187
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,180
caused among other things by the

188
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,249
scarcity of housing that occurs in

189
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,499
extreme cases of urban explosion we're

190
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,849
going to take a closer look at in a

191
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:12,069
minute but despite these challenges and

192
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:13,779
problems have you ever wondered what

193
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,580
exactly is the big attraction that

194
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,469
cities offer that leads so many people

195
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,700
to move to them well listen up

196
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,990
[Music]

197
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,900
city's cooperation hubs

198
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,510
why did industrialization emerge in

199
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,520
cities why are the head officers of

200
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,950
major companies always in the largest

201
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,780
cities well it's not only about having

202
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,430
access to better infrastructure such as

203
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,740
roads ports or airports but also about

204
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,140
having easy access to all of us that's

205
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,240
human resources companies need a lot of

206
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,100
different profiles different people to

207
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,610
be able to function have you ever

208
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,230
wondered how many people are involved in

209
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,870
the creation of just one everyday

210
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,540
product say for example a car you need

211
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,310
enter in his mechanics designers even

212
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,350
other Tanner's and artisans for the

213
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,830
vehicles interior details that's

214
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,810
precisely why the biggest cities where

215
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,370
more people of different profiles

216
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,980
coexist of the ideal place to find human

217
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,780
resources the more professionals and

218
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,400
different profiles there are the more

219
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,290
attractive the place is going to be

220
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,450
cities have become true hubs of human

221
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,430
cooperation where we fill the needs of

222
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,950
others and they in turn supply us with

223
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,270
what we lack

224
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,940
all this without even knowing us it's

225
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,860
rather incredible these hubs of

226
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,570
businesses entrepreneurship and

227
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,860
consumers have triggered economic growth

228
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,020
[Applause]

229
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,940
now at this point there's a question we

230
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,529
need to ask ourselves here on visual

231
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,120
politic and that's where is this

232
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,459
phenomenon happening most markedly do

233
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:50,029
you know

234
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,860
can you guess I'm sure it's not going to

235
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,480
surprise you because it's happening in

236
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,730
Asia but hold on a second because Africa

237
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:03,350
is already catching up and this is

238
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,120
hardly surprising since the beginning of

239
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,070
urbanization the income per capita for

240
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,050
the most urbanized Asian countries has

241
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,510
skyrocketed urbanization is directly

242
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,250
related to economic developments the

243
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,810
great amounts of knowledge goods and

244
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,610
services exchanges that take place in

245
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,350
cities were something unknown to mankind

246
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,540
until very recently they have something

247
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,270
of a modern miracle

248
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,620
Asian countries that have experienced

249
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,480
greater migrations from the country site

250
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,370
of the city have seen their citizens per

251
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,710
capita income skyrocket that's the case

252
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,050
in South Korea Thailand Japan and

253
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,370
Malaysia among others

254
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,439
check out this chart the greater the

255
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:46,209
concentration of inhabitants the higher

256
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,069
the country's per capita income and the

257
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,680
variation in just ten years between 2000

258
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,589
and 2010 leaves no room for doubt but

259
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,389
these aren't isolated cases this

260
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,160
phenomenon has extended throughout the

261
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,769
developed world Western Europe for

262
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,319
example was by far the first place to

263
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,509
experience urbanization doubling and

264
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,220
even tripling the rate of urbanization

265
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,319
found in the rest of the world in other

266
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,699
words to a large extent the old

267
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,559
continent success can be attributed to

268
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,959
its pioneering bet on cities in fact

269
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,730
with this data in hands the first thing

270
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,350
that may come to mind is how it is

271
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,569
surprising that it took so long for the

272
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,370
other regions to join this phenomenon

273
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,379
and yet achieve similar results so

274
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,209
quickly and it's not just an economic

275
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,199
issue not at all

276
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,059
science culture and political freedoms

277
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,870
have almost always originated in cities

278
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:46,230
[Music]

279
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,220
cooperation between human beings is

280
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,259
easier and simpler in these spaces

281
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,379
making it easier of a creativity

282
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,429
serendipity and influential political

283
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,740
movements to emerge and of course this

284
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,300
is no surprise in a village being

285
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,920
different or thinking differently can

286
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,929
make you an outcast in cities you become

287
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,639
one more part of an artistic

288
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,740
intellectual or political movement it's

289
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,870
really that simple now hold on just a

290
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,189
second I mean how can we accommodate

291
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,379
millions of rural people in cities

292
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,240
without having the necessary housing

293
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,519
infrastructure and services in India

294
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,319
well they know a bit about this

295
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:20,990
challenge

296
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,840
[Music]

297
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,940
India explosive organization

298
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,250
so we've already talked about this here

299
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,230
on visual politic India is starting to

300
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,870
become a manufacturing powerhouse it's

301
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,340
beginning to take its first steps

302
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,500
towards becoming China's competitor for

303
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,030
example Apple has already announced that

304
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,680
we'll stop manufacturing the new iPhone

305
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,050
in China to do it in India instead which

306
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,720
is pretty incredible actually Foxconn is

307
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,300
said close to trial output of newest

308
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,520
iPhones in India and of course

309
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,770
India's industrialization will require a

310
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,720
lot of workers people who are arriving

311
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,640
on mass from the countryside to the

312
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,810
cities

313
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,699
the urbanization phenomenon is happening

314
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,430
so rapidly that in India and in many

315
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,800
other cities of the developing world

316
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,029
guaranteeing access to basic services

317
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,029
such as electricity running water

318
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,319
education health and infrastructure is

319
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,779
posing gigantic problems as it requires

320
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,910
huge investment and this investment

321
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,889
poses quite a challenge in some

322
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,689
countries for example delegates around

323
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:30,579
700,000 new residents every single year

324
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:33,009
and already has more than 27 million

325
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,470
inhabitants in its metropolitan area its

326
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,439
growth is so astronomical by 2028 it

327
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,939
could become the largest mega city in

328
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:45,009
the world surpassing even Tokyo but hold

329
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,189
on just a second how can homes for

330
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:50,110
700,000 people be built in a single year

331
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,209
and what's more how can it be done year

332
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:54,639
after year after year in India

333
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,319
urbanization is happening very quickly

334
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:58,540
and this entails difficulties in

335
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,399
guaranteeing access to housing for all

336
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,019
the people arriving in the city due to

337
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,180
this is estimated that 24 percent of the

338
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,040
urban population lives in shanty towns

339
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,600
without even the most basic living

340
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,370
conditions basically in order to

341
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,990
accommodate all of Delhi's new

342
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,629
inhabitants you'd need to build between

343
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,360
700 and 900 million square meters of

344
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,819
accommodations every single year this

345
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,529
works outing something roughly the size

346
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,220
of Chicago being built every year so now

347
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:31,080
we have to ask is this even possible

348
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,330
it seems like a complicated challenge

349
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,550
and unfortunately many newcomers they're

350
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,899
forced to live in those shanty towns

351
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,730
which are better known as slums in Lao

352
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,740
boxy largest slum in Delhi more than

353
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,260
300,000 people live in a single square

354
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,940
kilometre it's really quite horrific

355
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,200
despy the Indian government's efforts to

356
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,269
build houses to relocate the poorest the

357
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,190
challenge is so huge that it's like

358
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,930
fighting against the clock to reduce

359
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,530
something that just doesn't stop growing

360
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,420
[Music]

361
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,880
so how is India going to deal with this

362
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,990
problem well we're going to talk about

363
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,120
this on a later video right here on

364
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,650
