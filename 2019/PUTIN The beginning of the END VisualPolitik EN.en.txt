[Music]

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,610
let's start with a question

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,620
it's Radomir Putin on the right or on

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,080
the left I know I know the answer might

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,790
seem obvious but think about it for a

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,240
moment

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,160
on one hand Putin's style has many

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,990
elements we would define as conservative

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,789
starting with his anti LGBT rights

11
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,710
gender and his ultra nationalistic

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,900
rhetoric

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,170
[Music]

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,580
but on the other hand he has many

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,050
qualities that would make a guy like

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,149
Jeremy Corbyn happy Russia is one of the

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,710
few countries that continues to support

18
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,900
nicolas maduro the communist dictator of

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,239
venezuela and his economic policy is far

20
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,190
from friendly to the free market even as

21
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,410
some left-wing artists like Oliver Stone

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,239
who would openly praise him anyway

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,129
regardless of where you place him on the

24
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,930
political spectrum Putin is one of the

25
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,550
most revered leaders according to his

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,360
own citizens

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,070
he has been ruling his country for 20

28
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,570
years and he still receives approval

29
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,030
ratings as high as 80% of course all of

30
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,129
this goes hand-in-hand with repression

31
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,109
of anybody who could challenge him but

32
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,879
facts are facts since the truth is that

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,589
the average Russian respects their

34
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,750
leader nevertheless this does seem to be

35
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,009
changing elections embarrassed the

36
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,920
Kremlin the ruling party loses half of

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,020
its Moscow's City Council seats

38
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,880
I know I know in a country like Russia

39
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,830
municipal elections aren't really that

40
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,750
important but they do show us that

41
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,460
something is beginning to change all of

42
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,920
a sudden Putin's party United Russia has

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,110
turned into a toxic brand its candidates

44
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,789
they no longer brag about their

45
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,649
membership but not only that if you've

46
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,000
been following visual politic for a

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,680
while you might remember a video we made

48
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,390
a year ago where we spoke about an

49
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,360
activist called Alexei Navalny we said

50
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,770
Navalny was the candidate with the

51
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,780
biggest chance of challenging Putin and

52
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,030
these latest elections proved us right

53
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,490
remember his name because he is certain

54
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,259
to generate a lots of headlines in the

55
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,820
future and rather the last time I gave

56
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,439
you a tip like this was when I predicted

57
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,329
the winner of the Nobel Prize some

58
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,340
months before Adi Ahmed actually won the

59
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,680
award so the question today is are we

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,210
witnessing the beginning of the end of

61
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,520
Putin why are so many Russians rejecting

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,740
that once revered leader one is changing

63
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,209
in Russia well today we're going to

64
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,009
answer these questions but before we do

65
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,920
let's take a look back at the history

66
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,910
a legend was born the year 1998 will

67
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,650
always be remembered because it was the

68
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,510
year Britney Spears released her first

69
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,280
super hit but this was not the only

70
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,110
tragedy that year while everyone was

71
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,060
suffering through hit me baby one more

72
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,720
time

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,850
Russians were suffering a world class

74
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,920
crisis out of nowhere international

75
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,360
investors were suddenly leaving the

76
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,250
country in droves and when investors

77
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,050
leave a country what will they do well

78
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,550
they quickly dumped that country's

79
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,650
currency in exchange for the currency of

80
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,510
the country where they want to reinvest

81
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,340
their money whether that's u.s. dollars

82
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,860
pound sterling etc this means that all

83
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,690
of a sudden everybody was selling rubles

84
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,489
and nobody wanted to buy them so what

85
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,739
happens in that case well obviously the

86
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,540
value of the currency drops like a rock

87
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,820
and so Russia underwent one of its

88
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,920
biggest devaluations ever from one day

89
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,570
to the next all the money Russian said

90
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,790
was worth half of what it used to be and

91
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,560
yes a good share of the blame should be

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,030
pins on the Russian presidents of the

93
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,830
time Boris Yeltsin Yeltsin was the

94
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,239
leader responsible for making the

95
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,980
transition from communism to capitalism

96
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,110
in Russia now without getting into

97
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,790
details a let's just say that even

98
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,410
Britney Spears would have done a better

99
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:22,950
job

100
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,750
unlike the Czech Republic or Poland

101
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,579
Russia sold their state-owned companies

102
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,980
to oligarchs this means that instead of

103
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,870
creating an environment where innovation

104
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,670
was encouraged the government just lived

105
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,920
on the only valuable thing they already

106
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,480
had to export yep

107
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,190
you guessed it of course I'm talking

108
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,660
about dinosaur juice

109
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,430
[Music]

110
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,890
in this regard poor Boris Yeltsin was

111
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,959
very unlucky well why

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,209
during the 1990s crude oil prices were

113
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,040
very low so it was only a matter of time

114
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,989
before the Russian economy would go down

115
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,790
the drain and this is exactly what

116
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,370
happened in 1998 Russia suffered from a

117
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,620
massive devaluation and a year later

118
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,689
Yeltsin had to resign with his

119
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,879
popularity hitting rock bottom and this

120
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,129
is when the man came into the picture

121
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,349
yes we're talking about the awesome the

122
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:14,980
unique the legendary resigns naming

123
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,169
Putin as Acting President to run in

124
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,600
March election having no political party

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,669
to back him Putin decided to run for

126
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,620
election as an independence and believe

127
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,360
me this was the best introduction to the

128
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,130
voting public he could have had liberal

129
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,600
parties have disappointed the Russians

130
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
so at the communist party before them

131
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Putin promised one thing and one thing

132
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,979
only stability to make sure that Russia

133
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,380
could have no more ugly surprises no

134
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,539
Chechen terrorism no currency

135
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:41,470
devaluations

136
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,860
no sudden recessions

137
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,690
[Applause]

138
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,150
and believe me back in 2000 this message

139
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,000
was even more of a hiss than oops I did

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,830
it again in fact while Britney Spears

141
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,750
was collecting platinum records Putin

142
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,640
won a landslide victory in his very

143
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,770
first elections with 53 percent of the

144
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,480
vote the next candidate on the list the

145
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,190
Communists won secured just 30 percent

146
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,130
and that's how Putin the legend was born

147
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,890
after that Putin created his own party

148
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,390
United Russia that was a merger between

149
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,820
two other large parties neither of which

150
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,120
at any specific ideology so yes unlike

151
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,370
Yeltsin's failed liberalism into the

152
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,440
harshness of Soviet Communism Putin

153
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,560
promised prosperity and stability so the

154
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,260
question is has he delivered well let's

155
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,090
take a look history repeats as soon as

156
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,550
Putin set foot in the Kremlin oil prices

157
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,320
skyrocketed all of a sudden the

158
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,790
government was making money like there

159
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,540
is no tomorrow

160
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,520
thanks to this Russia was able to lower

161
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,620
their tax rates to fiscal haven levels

162
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,930
today Russians pay a flat income tax of

163
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,060
just 13% then the government was still

164
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,040
making a lot of money from the oil

165
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,990
companies this income allowed Putin to

166
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,950
build roads skyscrapers and hospitals

167
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,170
on the face of it Moscow didn't seem to

168
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,720
have any reason to end the New York in

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,250
the average Russian saw how their

170
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,960
standard of living was also improving

171
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,730
there any problem the problem was that

172
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,170
instead of modernizing the economy

173
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:17,010
Russia remained essentially as it was

174
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,780
traded one elite group of corrupt

175
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,810
oligarchs for another elite group of

176
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,000
corrupt oligarchs today oil and gas

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,550
still account for 70% of Russian exports

178
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,380
in fact if you ever heard of a Russian

179
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,700
company that sells something other than

180
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,160
oil or gas showing us struggling so what

181
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,020
happens when you rely so much on one

182
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,910
commodity well this is what happens

183
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,260
economic and political headwinds are

184
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,480
battering Russia whose currency has been

185
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,820
weakened by the free falling oil price

186
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,670
and Western sanctions exactly once again

187
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,100
as soon as the oil prices dropped the

188
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,660
Russian economy fell apart

189
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,580
add to this the invasion of Crimea and

190
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,620
the subsequent economic sanctions and

191
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,600
you have the perfect storm it was the

192
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,240
case of DejaVu of the events of 1998 and

193
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,500
what happens when the international

194
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,650
investors fly away are once again in

195
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,300
2014 the currency was devalued because

196
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,610
everybody was selling but nobody was

197
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,650
buying so that same year the value of

198
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,990
the ruble hubbed in only five months the

199
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,180
average Russian saw how basic food items

200
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,400
such as breads or a humble cabbage

201
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,960
doubled in price and I know what you're

202
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,850
thinking now in such a terrible economic

203
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,770
crisis Putin's popularity must have

204
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,350
plummeted as low as britney Spears's

205
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,010
right well no actually wrong in fact the

206
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,870
opposite is true Putin's popularity kept

207
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,370
growing and this happened for two

208
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,080
reasons on the one hand the Kremlin

209
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,760
increased their propaganda on the other

210
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,260
hands who didn't made sure nobody

211
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,520
absolutely nobody could challenge him

212
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,590
1,400 arrested in opposition election

213
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,849
protests in Moscow

214
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,560
unless submitted this strategy has

215
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,870
worked for years until very recently

216
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,610
Putin's opposition was very weak and

217
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,889
very fractious it was a nuclear ideology

218
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,560
and nuclear leadership until now and now

219
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,659
is when we're going to introduce Alexei

220
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,699
Navalny again his name should sound

221
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,080
familiar if you've been following visual

222
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,090
politic for a while and you don't miss

223
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,069
any of our episodes which is what you

224
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,870
should do so back to our story mizuna

225
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,849
varney is a former lawyer who created an

226
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:12,650
anti-corruption platform his YouTube

227
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,509
channel has more than three million

228
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,099
subscribers and this is significant

229
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,080
given that Russian is a lot less widely

230
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,759
spoken than English and that Russia is

231
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,740
no country for political dissidents of

232
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,479
course Navalny himself was not allowed

233
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,129
to run for president and has spent more

234
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,800
time in jail than Britney Spears again I

235
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,419
guess but despite all of that

236
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,460
Navalny still holds enormous sway on

237
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,500
elections he just needed one course to

238
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,599
galvanize discontent among Russians

239
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,269
something else apart from corruption and

240
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,219
he found this cause in the raising of

241
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,560
the retirement age all vani calls for

242
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,930
mass rallies against pension reform so

243
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,399
some of you might be wondering are these

244
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,920
protests important can they really have

245
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,350
an impact election wise well let's take

246
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,430
a closer look country without ideologies

247
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,199
in the latest rounds of elections we

248
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,640
have seen how lots of liberals that

249
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,079
celebrated the fall of the Iron Curtain

250
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,000
have ended up voting for the Communists

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,410
for the first time in their lives and

252
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,850
while be wondering what has it even

253
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,649
possible while the truth is that in

254
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,690
today's Russia the land of Leninism

255
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,940
ideologies have basically died out there

256
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,670
is only putinism and all the rest in

257
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,829
these latest municipal elections all the

258
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,630
candidates that didn't belong to United

259
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,640
Russia were rejected by the electoral

260
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,800
committee and all of the protests were

261
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,480
repressed by the police nevertheless

262
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,880
unlike in the past the story had a very

263
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,080
different ending

264
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,700
Russian officials tried to frame Evon

265
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,640
goal enough instead they made him a hero

266
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,770
basically Ivan Golan oov is a journalist

267
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,570
who is researching corruption scandals

268
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,130
within the government as is often the

269
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,810
case in this country police found drugs

270
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,860
in his apartment

271
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,350
this is Russia after all you know you

272
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,960
start investigating PETA and drugs

273
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,820
appear in your apartment tomorrow

274
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,140
something like that

275
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,580
now these tactics they used to work in

276
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,920
the past but not with godunov protests

277
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,810
continued and the russian police have to

278
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,370
free golan off in fact support for

279
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,930
Putin's party fell to such a low level

280
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,150
that the candidates for Moscow City Hall

281
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,580
to make a drastic decision Russia United

282
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,100
candidates contested independence and

283
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,960
muff Scout polls however this hasn't

284
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,790
helped much Alexei Navalny presented a

285
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,710
list with all those fake independent

286
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,300
candidates but that's not all we said

287
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,680
earlier that opposition to Putin has

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,690
always been fractured right Novotny

289
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,340
couldn't even run for elections and he

290
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,960
has been sent to jail again nevertheless

291
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,120
despite all these obstacles this man has

292
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,830
managed to convince his followers to do

293
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:39,190
something very important with smart

294
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,440
voting strategy Russian opposition takes

295
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
aim of Putin's party of crooks and

296
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,480
thieves basically this smart voting plan

297
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,400
meant voting for whoever had the

298
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,410
greatest chance of defeating Putin's

299
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,100
candidates

300
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,690
no matter the ideology the values or the

301
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,400
party if you live in a district where

302
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,290
the Communist candidate has a strong

303
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,630
chance against Putin's candidate go and

304
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,220
vote to him anything is better than

305
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,380
United Russia literally anything and

306
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,180
this explains the good outcome that the

307
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,920
Communists have had this year in the

308
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,480
Moscow elections they went from having

309
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,720
five seats in City Hall to 13 in 2019

310
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,390
this means almost three times more seats

311
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,650
now this doesn't mean that all of a

312
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,630
sudden Muscovites have become communist

313
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,980
this just means they voted for whichever

314
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,440
candidate was not Putin and this is how

315
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,870
it played out

316
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,640
smart vote protests in Russia the deal

317
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,920
Putin's party of blow in the elections

318
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,140
we still can't say that this is the end

319
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,240
of putinism in fact Putin's party will

320
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,340
remain in power at Moscow city hall that

321
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,530
this is the first time Putin has

322
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,420
experienced some sort of defeat at the

323
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,220
elections what's more this is the first

324
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,780
time a rival political leader has been

325
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,190
able to look Putin in the face

326
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,680
in case you missed it Alexey Navalny and

327
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,149
I know what you're gonna say now here we

328
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,769
go again the guys from visual politic

329
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,420
with their free-market bias making

330
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,339
propaganda in favor of the Diwali guy

331
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,350
the reality is with far from celebrating

332
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,149
about his victory as we said a year ago

333
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,160
Navalny is not the type of politician we

334
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,810
would normally support a visual politic

335
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,850
first of all he's just another ultra

336
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,560
nationalist who has been very vocal

337
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,689
against immigration which is something

338
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:11,959
we usually like on this channel so far

339
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,149
he hasn't done or said anything that

340
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:16,279
proves he is the free market champion

341
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,569
that many people want to believe he is

342
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,459
but as you know by now here on visual

343
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:20,959
politic we analyze and we tell you

344
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,579
what's happening not what we wish would

345
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:23,990
happen and what is happening now is that

346
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,790
a man despite being in jail has been

347
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,560
able to convince millions of Russians to

348
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,329
make a protest vote so now the question

349
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,040
is over to you we witnessing the

350
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,420
beginning of the ends well we seen a

351
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,759
valley challenge Putin anytime soon and

352
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,829
if he were to win would we see just more

353
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,540
of the same or would he become a new

354
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,459
Putin please leave your answer in the
