3
00:00:08.24 --> 00:00:12.630
located between the Pacific Ocean and

4
00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
the Caribbean Sea we could say Colombia

5
00:00:12.63 --> 00:00:17.550
is something like the entry and exit

6
00:00:14.82 --> 00:00:20.789
door of South America and you know what

7
00:00:17.55 --> 00:00:23.250

the vibrant cities of midian Cali or

16
00:00:39.03 --> 00:00:45.059
barren quia and we can't forget about

17
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.870
the historical and proud Cartagena or

18
00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.520
the frantic Bogota those are being the

19
00:00:48.87 --> 00:00:52.320
great capital city of the country that

will leave you absolutely speechless yes

23
00:00:57.36 --> 00:01:01.469
we can't really be surprised that more

24
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.500
and more companies are making Colombia a

25
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.970
100% must visit destination well as you

26
00:01:04.5 --> 00:01:08.070
might have guessed this video is not

27
00:01:05.97 --> 00:01:10.470
going to be about tourism in Colombia

28
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:12.060
not at all it's politics that we do here

29
00:01:10.47 --> 00:01:14.780
at visual politic I mean it's right

30
00:01:12.06 --> 00:01:14.780
there in the name

31
00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.280
may 28th

32
00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.369
will have its next presidential election

33
00:01:20.28 --> 00:01:26.280
and by August 7th whoever wins will have

34
00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.470
begun his new job Juan Manuel Santos the

35
00:01:26.28 --> 00:01:30.450
current president cannot run again as he

36
00:01:28.47 --> 00:01:33.299
has reached his two-term limit

37
00:01:30.45 --> 00:01:34.890
so as Santos this time is coming to an

38
00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.750
end with this video we want to take a

39
00:01:34.89 --> 00:01:38.880
look ahead and find out what kind of

40
00:01:36.75 --> 00:01:40.439
Colombia he is going to leave to his

41
00:01:38.88 --> 00:01:43.229
successor we're going to have a look at

42
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:49.530
the great things as well as a not so

43
00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.090
great today's Colombia a gambling man a

44
00:01:49.53 --> 00:01:52.950
great poker player and part of one of

45
00:01:51.09 --> 00:01:57.090
the most influential families in

46
00:01:52.95 --> 00:01:58.049
Colombia this is Juan Manuel Santos even

47
00:01:57.09 --> 00:02:00.690
his great uncle

48
00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.810
Eduardo Santos was president of Colombia

49
00:02:00.69 --> 00:02:06.270
in the late 30s his family also owned

50
00:02:03.81 --> 00:02:09.269
example the most influential newspaper

51
00:02:06.27 --> 00:02:11.250
in the country in fact the very same

52
00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.560
quantum annual Santos was for a long

53
00:02:11.25 --> 00:02:15.599
time deputy director and a columnist at

54
00:02:13.56 --> 00:02:18.060
the newspaper what we are trying to say

55
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.920
is that this family a well never lacks

56
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:21.920
influence money or power

57
00:02:24.02 --> 00:02:29.670
but after two turns the 7th of August

58
00:02:27.0 --> 00:02:32.160
2017 marked the end of his time as

59
00:02:29.67 --> 00:02:34.980
president and to be honest his level of

60
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:37.200
popularity is pretty much rock-bottom

61
00:02:34.98 --> 00:02:39.240
this is even after winning the Nobel

62
00:02:37.2 --> 00:02:40.080
Peace Prize due to the deal that he got

63
00:02:39.24 --> 00:02:41.430
with FARC

64
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:43.980
the latest poll numbers when we're

65
00:02:41.43 --> 00:02:45.930
making this video show that 65 to 75% of

66
00:02:43.98 --> 00:02:48.660
Colombian people disapprove of his

67
00:02:45.93 --> 00:02:50.970
governance so the question now is how

68
00:02:48.66 --> 00:02:53.460
does a Nobel prize-winning leader have

69
00:02:50.97 --> 00:02:56.150
such strong disapproval ratings from his

70
00:02:53.46 --> 00:02:56.150
own people

71
00:02:57.76 --> 00:03:02.110
granted us to do with his broken promise

72
00:02:59.86 --> 00:03:03.430
about the peace deal with FARC remember

73
00:03:02.11 --> 00:03:05.769
he assured them that it was going to be

74
00:03:03.43 --> 00:03:07.659
the Colombian people and no one else you

75
00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.390
were going to have the last word on the

76
00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.329
deal and well let's just say that

77
00:03:10.39 --> 00:03:16.299
Santos forgot all about that Colombia

78
00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.239
referendum voters reject peace deal with

79
00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.579
FARC guerillas Columbia and FARC sign

80
00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.739
new peace deal this time

81
00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.540
skipping voters bus apart from all of

82
00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.640
this if there is really something that

83
00:03:25.54 --> 00:03:29.950
can make him have such low ratings well

84
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:32.109
well I would have to be the economy yeah

85
00:03:29.95 --> 00:03:34.090
during the last decade this specific Q

86
00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.889
Merkel's Colombia well you know it used

87
00:03:34.09 --> 00:03:37.720
to have quite strong growth and it even

88
00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.329
became one of the most thriving of the

89
00:03:37.72 --> 00:03:42.849
Latin American countries however lately

90
00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.549
things have been a little bit different

91
00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.200
actually they've been really quite a lot

92
00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.620
different I mean have a look at this

93
00:03:47.2 --> 00:03:49.620
chart

94
00:03:51.29 --> 00:03:57.439
plate Columbia is facing a situation of

95
00:03:54.64 --> 00:03:59.569
slowdown which is really much closer to

96
00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.370
what we've called stagnation the latest

97
00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.879
growth figures show a year-on-year

98
00:04:01.37 --> 00:04:06.980
increase of slightly above 1% and 2017

99
00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.129
forecasts don't seem to be that much

100
00:04:06.98 --> 00:04:13.579
better at all Lumbee --is economic

101
00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.370
growth rate will be 1.5 percent in 2017

102
00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.350
according to BBVA research as you can

103
00:04:16.37 --> 00:04:20.269
see this is really not a good figure

104
00:04:18.35 --> 00:04:22.490
especially if we consider that most of

105
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.560
the richest countries are growing at

106
00:04:22.49 --> 00:04:26.509
higher rate the United States Canada

107
00:04:24.56 --> 00:04:30.590
Spain Germany UK all of them will grow

108
00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.970
more than Colombia in 2017 and well you

109
00:04:30.59 --> 00:04:33.949
know it's kind of supposed to be there

110
00:04:31.97 --> 00:04:36.020
when you're a poorer country you grow

111
00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.720
more this is because of something that

112
00:04:36.02 --> 00:04:40.699
is called economic convergence so well

113
00:04:38.72 --> 00:04:42.710
now the question has to become what's

114
00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.870
going on in Colombia any blame this

115
00:04:42.71 --> 00:04:47.330
situation on the fall of oil and

116
00:04:44.87 --> 00:04:49.639
commodity prices and you know in a way

117
00:04:47.33 --> 00:04:53.840
this is sort of rice but there are some

118
00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.360
nuances that we do need to consider now

119
00:04:53.84 --> 00:04:58.430
it is true that at its climax in 2013

120
00:04:56.36 --> 00:05:00.680
oil did represent more than 50 percent

121
00:04:58.43 --> 00:05:02.630
of all the country's exports more than

122
00:05:00.68 --> 00:05:04.699
30 percent of all foreign direct

123
00:05:02.63 --> 00:05:08.810
investments and more than 20 percent of

124
00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:10.699
public reserves but it's also true that

125
00:05:08.81 --> 00:05:12.740
for many years thanks to the high oil

126
00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.810
prices the government of Colombia has

127
00:05:12.74 --> 00:05:16.729
had more resources than it's ever had

128
00:05:14.81 --> 00:05:18.560
before resources that could have been

129
00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.110
used to boost a productive and

130
00:05:18.56 --> 00:05:23.419
competitive economy unrelated to those

131
00:05:21.11 --> 00:05:24.590
original commodities and this is

132
00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.530
something that the Santos administration

133
00:05:24.59 --> 00:05:29.510
seems to not really have done perhaps

134
00:05:27.53 --> 00:05:32.419
this is because they've been dedicated

135
00:05:29.51 --> 00:05:35.000
is almost exclusively to that peace deal

136
00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.639
with fog anyway let's now have a look at

137
00:05:35.0 --> 00:05:39.810
what are the main weaknesses of the

138
00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.490
Colombian economy

139
00:05:39.81 --> 00:05:46.030
[Music]

140
00:05:41.49 --> 00:05:49.180
disastrous infrastructure the news

141
00:05:46.03 --> 00:05:51.460
Colombia has been should we say it there

142
00:05:49.18 --> 00:05:53.199
almost a failed state in many areas if

143
00:05:51.46 --> 00:05:55.660
you use our areas that were controlled

144
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.699
by warlords guerrillas militias and

145
00:05:55.66 --> 00:05:59.620
narcos all of those alternative things

146
00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.690
so now imagine how difficult it would be

147
00:05:59.62 --> 00:06:02.410
to manage such a country and build

148
00:06:01.69 --> 00:06:04.150
complex

149
00:06:02.41 --> 00:06:05.650
infrastructure there but really the

150
00:06:04.15 --> 00:06:11.919
reality is that that's not the whole

151
00:06:05.65 --> 00:06:14.650
story the reality is that infrastructure

152
00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.870
has never been a major priority for any

153
00:06:14.65 --> 00:06:18.789
Colombian government and the result of

154
00:06:16.87 --> 00:06:20.800
this it's pretty obvious the

155
00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.960
infrastructure in Colombia well it's

156
00:06:20.8 --> 00:06:25.030
really really bad today to describe

157
00:06:22.96 --> 00:06:27.430
Colombia's infrastructure we can use

158
00:06:25.03 --> 00:06:29.110
really any other word the dreadful most

159
00:06:27.43 --> 00:06:31.539
of their paved roads they're in a state

160
00:06:29.11 --> 00:06:33.550
of total disrepair and well what's the

161
00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.440
result of all of this and do pay close

162
00:06:33.55 --> 00:06:41.050
attention to this because well it's

163
00:06:35.44 --> 00:06:43.030
almost unbelievable moving a container

164
00:06:41.05 --> 00:06:46.150
within the country is twice as expensive

165
00:06:43.03 --> 00:06:48.729
as in Mexico or Bolivia and four times

166
00:06:46.15 --> 00:06:51.759
more expensive than in Argentina Chile

167
00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.530
or Peru in fact the situation is so

168
00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.300
disastrous that freight transport

169
00:06:53.53 --> 00:06:58.030
between the Colombian ports of buena

170
00:06:55.3 --> 00:07:00.400
Ventura and Bogota is three times more

171
00:06:58.03 --> 00:07:03.130
expensive than moving the same load from

172
00:07:00.4 --> 00:07:05.270
a Rotterdam to Franklin

173
00:07:03.13 --> 00:07:07.040
interestingly there are some reports

174
00:07:05.27 --> 00:07:09.380
that claim that sending a container from

175
00:07:07.04 --> 00:07:17.690
Carter haina to Bogota costs three times

176
00:07:09.38 --> 00:07:19.100
more than sending it to Shanghai so now

177
00:07:17.69 --> 00:07:20.900
you can probably imagine all of the

178
00:07:19.1 --> 00:07:23.090
effects that this has on supply costs

179
00:07:20.9 --> 00:07:25.820
prices and the competitiveness of

180
00:07:23.09 --> 00:07:28.699
Colombian companies according to a

181
00:07:25.82 --> 00:07:31.370
recent OECD report Colombia is the third

182
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.680
world most expensive country from which

183
00:07:31.37 --> 00:07:34.389
to explore containers after Venezuela

184
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:37.340
and Russia

185
00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:40.070
that's why Juan Manuel Santos decided in

186
00:07:37.34 --> 00:07:42.080
2010 to make changing this his top

187
00:07:40.07 --> 00:07:44.180
priority and it is true that his

188
00:07:42.08 --> 00:07:46.550
government has just released the biggest

189
00:07:44.18 --> 00:07:49.340

well designed but after seven years it's

197
00:08:11.16 --> 00:08:15.960
just a bit too late and it still comes

with many problems Viviana stirring his

Santos achievements really haven't been

201
00:08:18.51 --> 00:08:29.310
as good as he promised that they were

202
00:08:20.43 --> 00:08:31.290
going to be bureaucracy and taxes both

203
00:08:29.31 --> 00:08:33.120
the World Economic Forum and the World

204
00:08:31.29 --> 00:08:35.250

205
00:08:33.12 --> 00:08:37.430
the countries with the highest taxes on

206
00:08:35.25 --> 00:08:39.300
companies in the world which is

207
00:08:37.43 --> 00:08:41.700
obviously something that doesn't help

208
00:08:39.3 --> 00:08:43.920
companies to grow and develop according

209
00:08:41.7 --> 00:08:45.870
to the paying taxes reports that every

210
00:08:43.92 --> 00:08:48.000
year PricewaterhouseCoopers publishes to

211
00:08:45.87 --> 00:08:50.580
the total of all taxes that a Colombian

212
00:08:48.0 --> 00:08:53.300
company has to pay is sixty nine point

213

eight percent of their pre-tax profit

[Music]

215
00:08:56.54 --> 00:09:01.230
that's almost 70 percent which is

216
00:08:59.55 --> 00:09:03.270
significantly higher than in countries

217
00:09:01.23 --> 00:09:05.880
like Germany in Spain the United States

218
00:09:03.27 --> 00:09:07.260
to the earth it's pretty insane as I

219
00:09:05.88 --> 00:09:09.780
mean that's not even mentioning the

220
00:09:07.26 --> 00:09:12.120
bureaucracy which has an almost equal

221
00:09:09.78 --> 00:09:13.140
level of pure insanity one day we're

222
00:09:12.12 --> 00:09:14.730
really gonna have to make a video about

223
00:09:13.14 --> 00:09:16.500
the passion for the Yurok recei the

224
00:09:14.73 --> 00:09:18.000
Latin America seems to have that because

225
00:09:16.5 --> 00:09:19.830
it would be really long we're not going

226
00:09:18.0 --> 00:09:21.930
to touch on it in today's video it's

227
00:09:19.83 --> 00:09:23.790
just too huge of the topic but what we

228
00:09:21.93 --> 00:09:26.670
can say is that on an average day in

229
00:09:23.79 --> 00:09:33.900
Colombia 15 rules and three decrees are

230
00:09:26.67 --> 00:09:35.610
issues yes really every single day and

231
00:09:33.9 --> 00:09:37.290
not just that but according to research

232
00:09:35.61 --> 00:09:39.810
conducted by the University of La Habana

233
00:09:37.29 --> 00:09:42.600
more than 30 percent of the laws passed

234
00:09:39.81 --> 00:09:45.360
are useless and just create costs for

235
00:09:42.6 --> 00:09:47.250
Colombian society and so what ask why

236
00:09:45.36 --> 00:09:49.230
Manuel Santos d'Antibes solve all of

237
00:09:47.25 --> 00:09:51.330
these issues well he has done almost

238
00:09:49.23 --> 00:09:54.420
nothing in fact he has made the

239
00:09:51.33 --> 00:09:57.540
situation even worse

240
00:09:54.42 --> 00:10:02.280
[Music]

241
00:09:57.54 --> 00:10:04.080
the persistent violence it is true any

242
00:10:02.28 --> 00:10:06.210
aspects related to security are

243
00:10:04.08 --> 00:10:07.950
improving in Colombia the uptick in the

244
00:10:06.21 --> 00:10:10.410
tourism industry in the country is

245
00:10:07.95 --> 00:10:12.000
pretty good evidence of that in 2016

246
00:10:10.41 --> 00:10:13.470
five million tourists visited the

247
00:10:12.0 --> 00:10:15.930
country which is twice the number from

248
00:10:13.47 --> 00:10:18.780
2010 and almost ten times the number

249
00:10:15.93 --> 00:10:21.300
from 2000 which is certainly not bad

250
00:10:18.78 --> 00:10:23.820
however despite this in many areas of

251
00:10:21.3 --> 00:10:27.390
the country the situation it's not

252
00:10:23.82 --> 00:10:29.310
really improving according to the United

253
00:10:27.39 --> 00:10:31.950
Nations in the Colombian conflict

254
00:10:29.31 --> 00:10:33.990
analysis Resource Centre there is still

255
00:10:31.95 --> 00:10:36.150
violence in the most affected areas of

256
00:10:33.99 --> 00:10:38.460
the country that is the FARC peace deal

257
00:10:36.15 --> 00:10:41.550
has not substantially improved the

258
00:10:38.46 --> 00:10:43.350
situation in these areas in fact for

259
00:10:41.55 --> 00:10:45.780
example coke it's on growing and cocaine

260
00:10:43.35 --> 00:10:47.920
refining is that its absolute highest

261
00:10:45.78 --> 00:10:51.360
think just have a look at this chart

262
00:10:47.92 --> 00:10:53.550
[Music]

263
00:10:51.36 --> 00:10:55.649
so well now you might be wondering how

264
00:10:53.55 --> 00:10:57.390
did possible that violence levels and

265
00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:59.310
these production of illicit substances

266
00:10:57.39 --> 00:11:01.110
has not been reduced since the

267
00:10:59.31 --> 00:11:02.550
government's deal with FARC

268
00:11:01.11 --> 00:11:03.990
well that's because despite all the

269
00:11:02.55 --> 00:11:06.000
marketing from the government and while

270
00:11:03.99 --> 00:11:08.220
the violence by FARC was huge it

271
00:11:06.0 --> 00:11:10.709
actually represented less than ten

272
00:11:08.22 --> 00:11:12.450
percent of the nation's total violence

273
00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:13.890
and moreover the areas that FARC have

274
00:11:12.45 --> 00:11:15.750
left have not been occupied by

275
00:11:13.89 --> 00:11:18.000
government institutions for by other

276
00:11:15.75 --> 00:11:20.430
narco and militia groups some of them

277
00:11:18.0 --> 00:11:22.950
even having a mutual agreement with FARC

278
00:11:20.43 --> 00:11:25.140
after all the business it's still very

279
00:11:22.95 --> 00:11:26.579
attractive now the peace deal left many

280
00:11:25.14 --> 00:11:28.740
things up in the air and that's why

281
00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:30.839
these so-called peace dividend is not

282
00:11:28.74 --> 00:11:32.850
giving results as big as the government

283
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:34.740
promised now to be fair though not

284
00:11:32.85 --> 00:11:36.660
everything has been totally bad under

285
00:11:34.74 --> 00:11:41.150
Santos's presidency

286
00:11:36.66 --> 00:11:45.600
[Music]

287
00:11:41.15 --> 00:11:47.100
the best of the Santos administration we

288
00:11:45.6 --> 00:11:49.350
have to admit that Juan Manuel Santos

289
00:11:47.1 --> 00:11:50.910
has achieved some pretty good things

290
00:11:49.35 --> 00:11:52.530
his government actually brought Colombia

291
00:11:50.91 --> 00:11:53.580
to the Pacific Alliance and this is

292
00:11:52.53 --> 00:11:55.860
another thing we're going to talk about

293
00:11:53.58 --> 00:11:57.720
in an upcoming video so do not forget to

subscribe hit that button below and of

295
00:11:57.72 --> 00:12:01.050
course this foreign agenda has been a

296
00:11:59.52 --> 00:12:02.940
great strength of this government

297
00:12:01.05 --> 00:12:04.860
Colombia today is more open to the world

298
00:12:02.94 --> 00:12:06.240
than it ever has been before so that

299
00:12:04.86 --> 00:12:09.030
poverty has been reduced considerably

300
00:12:06.24 --> 00:12:15.720
the country has attracted lots of

301
00:12:09.03 --> 00:12:17.040
foreign investment but despite all of

302
00:12:15.72 --> 00:12:18.630
this our impression here a visual

303
00:12:17.04 --> 00:12:20.850
politic is that the arrival of a new

304
00:12:18.63 --> 00:12:23.190
government can really be a positive

305
00:12:20.85 --> 00:12:24.960
turning point for Colombia when Juan

306
00:12:23.19 --> 00:12:26.880
Manuel Santos took office the country

307
00:12:24.96 --> 00:12:29.190
seemed to be ready to tackle a real

308
00:12:26.88 --> 00:12:30.900
process of transformation and their oil

309
00:12:29.19 --> 00:12:33.360
resources meant that they had the

310
00:12:30.9 --> 00:12:35.190
ability to pay for it however this above

311
00:12:33.36 --> 00:12:37.320
yes it simply hasn't been achieved in

312
00:12:35.19 --> 00:12:39.750
fact it's kind of in the opposite Santos

313
00:12:37.32 --> 00:12:41.670
leaves a weak economic Colombia and many

314
00:12:39.75 --> 00:12:43.530
more future prospects than current

315
00:12:41.67 --> 00:12:45.570
realities so now we'd love to know your

316
00:12:43.53 --> 00:12:48.000
opinion wanting you think the future of
