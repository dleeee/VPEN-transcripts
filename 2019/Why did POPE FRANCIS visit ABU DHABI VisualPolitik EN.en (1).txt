[Music]

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,500
religion and politics always go together

31
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,229
in the Arabian Peninsula the birthplace

32
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:15,479
of Islam

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,090
every year over two million Muslim

34
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,729
pilgrims go to Saudi Arabia to visit

35
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:21,360
Mecca

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,409
[Music]

37
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,990
and in neighboring Abu Dhabi you will

38
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,179
find the most modern architecture

39
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,329
combined with the most ancient

40
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:36,140
traditions in this part of the planet

41
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,609
Islam is the law nonetheless what if I

42
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,920
tell you that this area of the planet is

43
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,799
the one with the fastest-growing

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,189
Christian population really not kidding

45
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,170
here while Europe is carrying less and

46
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,509
less about the Catholic Church here at

47
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,520
the core of the Islamic world we have

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,530
the fastest growing Catholic population

49
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,239
I'll tell my practice yep oh boy so how

50
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,319
is that even possible

51
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,759
what enough happened to make Pope

52
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,369
Francis make an official visit to Abu

53
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,150
Dhabi times are a-changing or maybe not

54
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,220
so much in this video we're going to

55
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,510
tell you that story

56
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,970
[Applause]

57
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,140
it doesn't matter if you're Catholic or

58
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,690
not everybody has heard of the Pope and

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,670
Pope Francis has the most followers in

60
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,340
the most unexpected places

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,710
[Music]

62
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,200
because let's be honest here Catholicism

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,450
is not having his best moment in either

64
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,640
Europe or Latin America so you might ask

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,530
well where are they having a bigger

66
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,750
presence then well that would actually

67
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,450
be the Arabian Peninsula countries like

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,910
Saudi Arabia Qatar and the United Arab

69
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,550
Emirates have more and more Catholics

70
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,260
and I know you're thinking I mean how is

71
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,240
that even possible I mean we probably

72
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,640
all know that Qatar and the United Arab

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,620
Emirates have allowed Catholics to build

74
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,780
their own churches but just look at the

75
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,990
Abu Dhabi Cathedral

76
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,130
[Music]

77
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,380
notice anything funny about it well

78
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,110
there aren't no crosses whatsoever the

79
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,120
truth is in this country you can go to

80
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,670
mass but you can't evangelize and if

81
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,080
you're a Muslim and you happen to

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,210
convert to Christianity watch out

83
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,490
because that's a crime as you can

84
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,170
imagine the growth of Catholicism in

85
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,880
this part of the world is explained by

86
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,670
one word and pretty much one word only

87
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,830
and that's immigration if you've been

88
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,420
following this channel for a while you

89
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,190
already know that the our rich Arabian

90
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,810
monarchies have more immigrants than

91
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,420
they do locals in places like Qatar in

92
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,710
the UAE the foreign-born population

93
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,050
makes up more than 80% of the total and

94
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,700
of course most of those immigrants

95
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,260
they're Muslim they come from countries

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,630
like Bangladesh and Pakistan but you

97
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,910
also have a lot of Americans and a lot

98
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,310
of Filipinos who are Catholic and this

99
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,950
explains news like this

100
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,620
they will visit Pope Francis lands in

101
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,110
Abu Dhabi for historic first golf trip

102
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,430
yep you heard that right for the first

103
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,380
time in history a pope has visited the

104
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,720
arabian peninsula and this was not a

105
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,099
small visit more than a hundred and

106
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,780
eighty thousand people attended his mass

107
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,700
to put this in context that's more than

108
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
twice the number of people who went to

109
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,169
his latest mass in chile a catholic

110
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,180
country in other words catholicism is a

111
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,190
bigger deal than you'd expect in arab

112
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,419
countries so now you might be wondering

113
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,460
well why did the abu dhabi authorities

114
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,620
allow such an event in their country why

115
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,780
did the pope get to go there i mean i

116
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,210
mean was this a strategic move what does

117
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,340
Pope Francis want to achieve with this

118
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,169
well today we're going to answer all of

119
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,790
those questions but before we do let's

120
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,080
take a look back at the history

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,330
fucktard non verba Pope Francis is the

122
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,280
leader of three organizations at the

123
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,980
same time on the one hand he is the head

124
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,110
of the Catholic Church

125
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,150
that is a religious role that we're not

126
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,650
going to get into because this is a

127
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,870
channel about politics and not religion

128
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,819
but do not worry because the Pope has

129
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,460
two other political drops first he's the

130
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,080
head of the world's smallest state

131
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,330
Vatican City and on top of that he's

132
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,030
also the head of the Holy See and oh boy

133
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,680
Vatican City might be a really tiny

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
nation but the diplomatic influence of

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,550
the Holy See is really big

136
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,650
they have embassies in almost all of the

137
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,909
world's countries and they've played a

138
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,270
major role throughout history for

139
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,009
example Pope John Paul the second was a

140
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,690
key player in the fight against

141
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,759
communism in both Poland and in the

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,770
Soviet Union and he also lobbied against

143
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,620
the invasion of Iraq

144
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,580
[Music]

145
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,310
his successor benefit the sixteenth was

146
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,260
far less political his legacy focused on

147
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,690
theology and philosophical essays the

148
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,210
current Pope Pope Francis he's far more

149
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,980
political than the other two then this

150
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,020
is why he's quite circumcircle

151
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,300
to son he's an evil communist tear

152
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,490
others he is the champion of dignity and

153
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,410
human rights he's a man who speaks out

154
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,050
clearly against capitalism

155
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,680
Pope Francis on economic inequality such

156
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,590
an economy kills if Jesus Christ liked

157
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,020
to talk in parables Pope Francis likes a

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,210
more straightforward style look at its

159
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,800
tough words - Donald Trump Donald Trump

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,139
is quote not Christian if he wants to

161
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,120
build a border wall but as they say in

162
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,539
Latin factor non verba which means acts

163
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,780
not words if we look at the facts we

164
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,310
discover a totally different pipe

165
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,960
actually he has more in common with

166
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,240
Donald Trump than we might think

167
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,159
if Trump summarized his political views

168
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,020
with the motto America first we can

169
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,909
summarize Pope Francis's views as

170
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:51,000
Catholic first this doesn't sound very

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,919
spiritual but we could compare the

172
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,389
Catholic Church to a multinational

173
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,639
corporation with residences all over the

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,620
world in this light catholicism is

175
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,060
losing ground in their traditional

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,740
markets the number of believers in

177
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,880
Europe is getting smaller and smaller

178
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,310
and in Latin America they're in fierce

179
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,139
competition with the evangelical

180
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,669
churches so the new Vatican

181
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,710
Administrative Board they've got a clear

182
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,039
strategy find new markets one of those

183
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:21,150
markets is China for decades Catholicism

184
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,949
was forbidden that but as you know the

185
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,569
Chinese Communist Party they're very

186
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,729
creative so instead of fully banning

187
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,979
religion what they did was create a fake

188
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,930
copy of Catholicism it's a religion

189
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,610
that's the same in every way to the real

190
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,740
thing but there's one exception bishops

191
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,960
were not appointed by the Vatican but by

192
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,029
the Communist Party and of course those

193
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,770
Catholics who kept their loyalty to the

194
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,849
Pope of Rome they were sent to

195
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,110
concentration camps where they were

196
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,509
tortured and even worse they had their

197
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:47,130
organs removed for the Chinese

198
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,190
transplant system

199
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,590
in the situation a pope like john paul

200
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,510
ii would have surely adopted a

201
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,550
confrontational position but Pope

202
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,770
Francis knows how to apply the part of

203
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,150
the deal better than Donald Trump

204
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,390
himself so well what did he do well this

205
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,070
is where the Chinese transplant system

206
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,890
comes into play for years China has been

207
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,840
taking organs from political prisoners

208
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,270
for their transplants this is called

209
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,950
organ harvesting as you can imagine

210
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,480
there is all kinds of pressure from

211
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,250
international organizations across the

212
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,590
world to stop this massacre meanwhile

213
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,450
China denies all of the accusations

214
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,730
despite all of the evidence that shows

215
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,880
otherwise they even have a doctor who

216
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,710
tries to go to all of the international

217
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,539
conferences to pitch the official

218
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,880
Chinese narrative no country accepts him

219
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
as a speaker of course because they

220
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,490
don't want to listen to his propaganda

221
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,669
no country that is except of a Vatican

222
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,040
the Vatican was the first and only

223
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,290
country outside of China that allowed

224
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,910
this doctor do you participate in an

225
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,700
events and self his story he was able to

226
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,830
pitch the peerless advantages of the

227
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,990
Chinese Transplant system to the whole

228
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,570
world the one system that miraculously

229
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,970
confined organs in just a matter of days

230
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,160
a system that of course meets all of the

231
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,530
human bright standards and all the last

232
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,560
stuff because well I mean when is China

233
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,180
ever exploited human rights before

234
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,040
everybody knows that the Chinese

235
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
Communist Party is the biggest fan of

236
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,960
democracy human rights and all of that

237
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,510
jolly good stuff right look needless to

238
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,520
say this Vatican conference it raised a

239
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,620
lot of criticism all over the world but

240
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,180
just a couple of months later Pope

241
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,800
Francis in your new Answers

242
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,699
[Music]

243
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,259
China and Vatican Beach deal and

244
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,569
appointment of Bishops there you go man

245
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:37,750
just one diplomatic gamble and boom the

246
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,940
Catholic Church now it's got 12 million

247
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,740
more followers with listen Lane they've

248
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,839
already compensated for the lack of new

249
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,660
converts in a country like Spain so

250
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,550
where does that go now well exactly

251
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,930
that's the Arab world

252
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,699
what Benedict the sixteenth openly

253
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,920
criticized Islam Pope Francis has made a

254
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,199
dramatic shift for example do you

255
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:57,879
remember the Charlie Hebdo terrorist

256
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,439
attacks all of the world leaders were

257
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:01,149
condemning them without reservation

258
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,829
birds in this situation the normally

259
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,500
straight talk in Francis he turned to

260
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:11,069
parables for once

261
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,899
Canton saw other people's faith for

262
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,240
example if dr. gooseberry says a bad

263
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,189
word against my mother he can expect me

264
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,139
to punch him in the face this is normal

265
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,970
Pope Francis it's a big statement isn't

266
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,620
it but the goodwill gestures towards

267
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,230
Islam they do not stop here here's

268
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,710
another example

269
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,780
[Music]

270
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,980
in this picture we can see Pope Francis

271
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,620
in the grand Imam of al-azhar one of the

272
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,630
biggest representatives of Sunni Islam

273
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,420
they are together calling upon everybody

274
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,790
to build a more tolerant world with less

275
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,010
violence and imma be wondering well why

276
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,810
this strategy what does the Pope want to

277
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,370
achieve here well let's have a look

278
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,770
shall we

279
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,750
tolerant slavery Pope Francis is

280
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,730
Argentinian of Italian descent his

281
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,140
family were immigrants who came to

282
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,390
Argentina looking for a better life and

283
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,500
you know where we have a lot of

284
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,400
immigrants now

285
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,260
well yeah once again that's the Arabian

286
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,860
Peninsula

287
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,810
[Music]

288
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,840
but not all of those immigrants are born

289
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,120
equal cynical as it sounds we should

290
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,220
make a distinction on the one hand you

291
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,020
have the expats and on the other hand

292
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,120
you have the immigrants an expat might

293
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,370
be an American who comes to Abu Dhabi to

294
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,260
work for ExxonMobil with a six-figure

295
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,070
salary

296
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,329
[Music]

297
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,499
and immigrants on the other hand is a

298
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,149
Filipino who shares a room with 10 other

299
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,279
people works 12-hour shifts and has a

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,899
miserable salary most of these

301
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,730
immigrants they work in construction

302
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,249
north a clean houses their families are

303
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:42,509
usually back in their country of origin

304
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,029
and they send the money regularly many

305
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,559
of you might be thinking right now well

306
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,509
ok Simon but don't exaggerate if they

307
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,249
don't like their working conditions they

308
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,559
can always go home right well actually

309
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,529
it's not that easy you see here in the

310
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,089
Arabian Peninsula there's a system

311
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:03,350
called the Kafala

312
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,550
according to Kafala immigrants are

313
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,710
linked to a local called the patron if

314
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,210
you want to change your job you're gonna

315
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,950
ask a patron for permission you want to

316
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,930
work for another company ask your patron

317
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,400
wants to leave the country and go back

318
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,210
to your homeland

319
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,880
well yeah once again you got to check

320
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,410
with your patron and if you don't get

321
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,490
that permission and you've got to keep

322
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,990
living in the country essentially

323
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,840
working as a slave so well in the United

324
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,550
Arab Emirates alone there are more than

325
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,100
1 million Catholics who live under these

326
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,720
conditions most of them come from the

327
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,760
Philippines and some parts of India and

328
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,230
is you can imagine in such a desperate

329
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,570
situation many people stick to their

330
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,980
faith more than ever nevertheless

331
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,300
despite these slave-like conditions

332
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,970
these workers are crucial to the economy

333
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,320
who else is going to build the

334
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,070
skyscrapers

335
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,660
in other words building a cathedral in

336
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,370
Abu Dhabi is a cheap way to keep these

337
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,310
workers moderately happy they might be

338
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,030
exploited but at least they've got a

339
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,860
place to pray and he might now be

340
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,300
wondering well how is it possible that

341
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,880
the authorities of these countries being

342
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,340
such Islamic hardliners would allow them

343
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,080
to build a cathedral well dear viewers

344
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,660
the enemies of Arab monarchies neither

345
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,970
Christians nor Hindus the main enemies

346
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,640
of Arab monarchies saw other Muslims for

347
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,840
example the Muslim Brotherhood

348
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,880
think about it which is more dangerous

349
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,920
for an Emir the Philippine immigrants

350
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,660
praying inside of a Cathedral or the

351
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,640
Muslim Brotherhood who claim no loyalty

352
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,170
to anything other than the Koran the

353
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,690
answer it's pretty obvious

354
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,910
this is why in the UAE they have better

355
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,040
things to do than persecuting Christians

356
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,019
which this is why they're so tolerant

357
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,540
but remember there's that tolerance but

358
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,160
they're also violating their human

359
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,139
rights systematically and this this is

360
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:46,760
where Pope Francis enters the picture

361
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,110
[Music]

362
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,660
the Pope in Abu Dhabi all right so I can

363
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,680
probably guess what you're thinking it's

364
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,509
okay for them to build a church in Abu

365
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,269
Dhabi but I mean a papal visit there's

366
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,980
sort of a different thing isn't it well

367
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,199
truth be told this is actually great for

368
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,509
Abu Dhabi for one they improved their

369
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,490
outside image all of a sudden a country

370
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,079
that was associated with religious

371
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,300
fanaticism is hosting the leader of

372
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,769
another religion who could say that

373
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,540
they're fanatics now but that's not all

374
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,220
with a little effort Abu Dhabi's

375
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,139
government is given a great gift to

376
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,910
those Catholic immigrants the visit is

377
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,040
good news both for those Filipinos

378
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,410
working for pennies and also the expats

379
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,120
with their six-figure salaries in the

380
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,330
end everyone's happy

381
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,200
[Music]

382
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,269
but the question is what does the Pope

383
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:35,040
want to achieve with this well think

384
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,610
about it

385
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,649
Pope Francis came here to a place where

386
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,690
evangelizing is forbidden and then he

387
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,950
organized the mother of all masses a

388
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,269
hundred and eighty thousand people and

389
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,160
this amazing cross that you could see

390
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,970
from everywhere in abu-dhabi this is

391
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,279
raising the bar now they've set a big

392
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,740
precedence for a would-be change in Arab

393
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,420
legislation and this explains why the

394
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,730
vicar apostolic in Arabia Paul hinder

395
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,529
said all of these beautiful things about

396
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,740
the governments of the UAE prayed for

397
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,480
the rulers of this country who make it

398
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,880
possible I thank the UAE government for

399
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,769
their generosity not only have they made

400
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,000
this visit possible but have

401
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,920
wholeheartedly given us a venue to

402
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,810
celebrate mass and what about Pope

403
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,240
Francis yes he was all Don Donald Trump

404
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,350
but when it comes to the Abu Dhabi

405
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,230
authorities he didn't have a word to say

406
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,690
about a father or the war in Yemen in

407
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,440
fact this is what he said is there like

408
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,690
a chicken your country is a land that

409
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,269
wants to be a model of coexistence human

410
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,250
Brotherhood and gathering of different

411
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,690
cultures and civilizations after these

412
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,279
gestures it wouldn't be hard to imagine

413
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,260
the United Arab Emirates lifting their

414
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,540
ban on other religions or at least on

415
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,310
Catholicism this would be a giant step

416
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,410
that the church in a market yet to be

417
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,360
tapped so now it's your turn do you

418
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,430
think the Pope is a deal-making genius

419
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,470
off any you should care a little bit

420
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,290
