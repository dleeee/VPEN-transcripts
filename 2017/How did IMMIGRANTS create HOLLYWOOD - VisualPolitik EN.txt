00:00:05.65 --> 00:00:09.269
[Music]

3
00:00:06.92 --> 00:00:11.250
Hollywood's it's the world's most famous

4
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.019
neighborhood and yes I said that

5
00:00:11.25 --> 00:00:15.030
absolutely right Hollywood is a

6
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.279
neighborhood it's not a city it's not

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:19.410
even a village Hollywood is a district

8
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.630
inside the city of Los Angeles with a

9
00:00:19.41 --> 00:00:24.269
population of less than 90,000 people

10
00:00:21.63 --> 00:00:27.800
nonetheless here is where most of the

11
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.800
movie industry is concentrated

12
00:00:28.06 --> 00:00:32.050
but wait just a minute because I know

13
00:00:29.98 --> 00:00:33.610
what you're gonna say come on signer and

14
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:35.530
I know better than this this isn't at

15
00:00:33.61 --> 00:00:37.270
all true the biggest movie production

16
00:00:35.53 --> 00:00:39.520
Center in the world is Bollywood in

17
00:00:37.27 --> 00:00:41.290
India well my dear viewers you are sort

18
00:00:39.52 --> 00:00:43.809
of writer but there is a pretty

19
00:00:41.29 --> 00:00:45.519
significant but now despite the fact

20
00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.160
that the Indian movie industry makes

21
00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:52.410
more movies than anyone their income is

22
00:00:48.16 --> 00:00:52.410
tiny compared to that of Hollywood I

23
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.309
mean just think about it how many indian

24
00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.400
movies have you actually seen let the

25
00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.080
answer that is none or loston unless of

26
00:01:00.4 --> 00:01:04.180
course you're Indian in which case hello

27
00:01:02.08 --> 00:01:06.610
dear Indian viewers now with a few

28
00:01:04.18 --> 00:01:09.010
exceptions Bollywood movies are made to

29
00:01:06.61 --> 00:01:11.650
the domestic market and the same goes

30
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:13.630
for Nigeria yeah Nigeria is actually the

31
00:01:11.65 --> 00:01:15.820
second largest movie producer in the

32
00:01:13.63 --> 00:01:17.590
world behind Bollywood but I'm sure

33
00:01:15.82 --> 00:01:19.930
hardly any of you have actually seen a

34
00:01:17.59 --> 00:01:21.610
film made in this country unless you are

35
00:01:19.93 --> 00:01:24.100
of course a Nigerian in which case hello

36
00:01:21.61 --> 00:01:25.990
Nigerian viewers so when it comes to the

37
00:01:24.1 --> 00:01:28.900
raw economics of it all Hollywood is

38
00:01:25.99 --> 00:01:30.610
undoubtedly the world's movie capital so

39
00:01:28.9 --> 00:01:32.499
now you might be wondering well Simon

40
00:01:30.61 --> 00:01:34.329
why are we talking about cinema here a

41
00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:36.280
visual politic isn't this channel all

42
00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.469
about politics and economics I mean

43
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:41.800
what's the connection here well actually

44
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:46.630
there are a lot of connections

45
00:01:41.8 --> 00:01:48.710
[Music]

46
00:01:46.63 --> 00:01:50.570
first there is the fact that there is a

47
00:01:48.71 --> 00:01:52.700
political reason why so much of the

48
00:01:50.57 --> 00:01:53.780
movie world is centered in Hollywood at

49
00:01:52.7 --> 00:01:56.240
the end of the day I mean why is

50
00:01:53.78 --> 00:01:58.159
Hollywood in Los Angeles and not in New

51
00:01:56.24 --> 00:02:00.500
York or London or somewhere else

52
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.210
entirely now many of you might think

53
00:02:00.5 --> 00:02:04.729
that California has always been an

54
00:02:02.21 --> 00:02:06.500
important state inside the US with

55
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.479
innovative companies prestigious

56
00:02:06.5 --> 00:02:10.429
universities and celebrities just

57
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.750
walking down the street but the truth is

58
00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.870
that at the beginning of the 20th

59
00:02:11.75 --> 00:02:15.530
century LA had less than 100,000

60
00:02:14.87 --> 00:02:17.870
inhabitants

61
00:02:15.53 --> 00:02:19.519
in fact the first movie producers were

62
00:02:17.87 --> 00:02:21.220
born on the other side of the country

63
00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.230
within cities like New York or Chicago

64
00:02:21.22 --> 00:02:26.450
so the question we have to ask now is

65
00:02:24.23 --> 00:02:28.850
well why did they decide to move to LA

66
00:02:26.45 --> 00:02:30.860
what does Hollywood have that Manhattan

67
00:02:28.85 --> 00:02:32.690
doesn't and the most important question

68
00:02:30.86 --> 00:02:35.150
of all what does immigration have to do

69
00:02:32.69 --> 00:02:36.920
with any of this well today we are going

70
00:02:35.15 --> 00:02:39.650
to answer all of those questions but

71
00:02:36.92 --> 00:02:42.610
before we do as usual let's take a look

72
00:02:39.65 --> 00:02:42.610
at the history

73
00:02:43.99 --> 00:02:48.380
part by and for immigrants the first

74
00:02:47.03 --> 00:02:50.209
question of all one has to be who

75
00:02:48.38 --> 00:02:51.709
invented movies in the first place the

76
00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.750
Lumiere brothers

77
00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.580
well not exactly what the Lumiere

78
00:02:53.75 --> 00:02:58.400
brothers invented was the system to

79
00:02:55.58 --> 00:03:00.440
project films onto a big screen but

80
00:02:58.4 --> 00:03:02.870
years before that the company of Thomas

81
00:03:00.44 --> 00:03:05.480
Edison had already discovered a system

82
00:03:02.87 --> 00:03:07.760
to record and play short movies and this

83
00:03:05.48 --> 00:03:09.860
was called a Kinetoscope it was a device

84
00:03:07.76 --> 00:03:13.630
where you would put a coin into a slot

85
00:03:09.86 --> 00:03:13.630
hands watch movies through a peephole

86
00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.680
years later this system would be

87
00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.750
improved so that these short films could

88
00:03:18.68 --> 00:03:22.910
be projected onto a big screen as well

89
00:03:20.75 --> 00:03:24.739
but the big difference between Edison

90
00:03:22.91 --> 00:03:27.019
and the Lumiere brothers was that the

91
00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.880
American businessman knew that these

92
00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.340
could make big-time money anything that

93
00:03:31.88 --> 00:03:37.970
won't sell I don't want to invent its

94
00:03:34.34 --> 00:03:41.840
sale is proof of utility and utility is

95
00:03:37.97 --> 00:03:43.040
success Thomas Alva Edison so while the

96
00:03:41.84 --> 00:03:45.140
Lumiere brothers showed off their

97
00:03:43.04 --> 00:03:47.090
invention at scientific fairs Edison

98
00:03:45.14 --> 00:03:48.980
made a profit from it his business

99
00:03:47.09 --> 00:03:50.720
consisted of selling these machines

100
00:03:48.98 --> 00:03:52.670
taking a royalty for their use and

101
00:03:50.72 --> 00:03:56.000
supplying movie theaters with lots and

102
00:03:52.67 --> 00:03:59.239
lots of films in just two decades Edison

103
00:03:56.0 --> 00:04:00.590
made more than 1,200 movies so now you

104
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.560
might be wondering what what kind of

105
00:04:00.59 --> 00:04:05.750
movies did Edison produce well asthma's

106
00:04:03.56 --> 00:04:07.549
are more not as it possibly sounds many

107
00:04:05.75 --> 00:04:10.250
of these first films in history were

108
00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.019
about women getting undressed but movies

109
00:04:10.25 --> 00:04:14.420
were a bigger opportunity in just a few

110
00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.060
years cities like New York and Chicago

111
00:04:14.42 --> 00:04:19.790
became flooded with movie theaters the

112
00:04:17.06 --> 00:04:22.070
so called Nickelodeon's

113
00:04:19.79 --> 00:04:24.200
here can find a great show at a lower

114
00:04:22.07 --> 00:04:26.330
price and another theaters Plus since

115
00:04:24.2 --> 00:04:28.250
the movies were silent you didn't need

116
00:04:26.33 --> 00:04:29.720
to speak English to understand them

117
00:04:28.25 --> 00:04:31.520
this means movies became the perfect

118
00:04:29.72 --> 00:04:33.710
entertainment for all the immigrants

119
00:04:31.52 --> 00:04:35.150
arriving to the land of opportunity all

120
00:04:33.71 --> 00:04:37.370
of this it was happening in the first

121
00:04:35.15 --> 00:04:39.620
decade of the 20th century Manoir France

122
00:04:37.37 --> 00:04:41.810
and interestingly Denmark already were

123
00:04:39.62 --> 00:04:43.760
producing their own movies no other

124
00:04:41.81 --> 00:04:48.830
country had a bigger audience that

125
00:04:43.76 --> 00:04:50.630
America however Thomas Edison he was

126
00:04:48.83 --> 00:04:52.670
unable to see all of the opportunities

127
00:04:50.63 --> 00:04:54.890
behind his invention at the ends of the

128
00:04:52.67 --> 00:04:57.140
day he was the typical wasp and he

129
00:04:54.89 --> 00:04:58.970
despised immigrants of course he was

130
00:04:57.14 --> 00:05:00.560
happy to make money from them but he

131
00:04:58.97 --> 00:05:01.850
didn't really like them and so now you

132
00:05:00.56 --> 00:05:03.560
might be asking well why didn't he

133
00:05:01.85 --> 00:05:05.450
invest money in improving the quality of

134
00:05:03.56 --> 00:05:06.680
his films well at the end of the day his

135
00:05:05.45 --> 00:05:08.630
company had a monopoly over the

136
00:05:06.68 --> 00:05:10.460
production and distribution of the films

137
00:05:08.63 --> 00:05:12.350
like he really didn't have any incentive

138
00:05:10.46 --> 00:05:14.420
to all those Nickelodeon's paid

139
00:05:12.35 --> 00:05:16.610
royalties to Edison's company and bought

140
00:05:14.42 --> 00:05:18.290
his films without even looking at the

141
00:05:16.61 --> 00:05:21.170
titles or plots at the end of the day

142
00:05:18.29 --> 00:05:22.700
nobody thought those German Italian or

143
00:05:21.17 --> 00:05:30.080
Hungarian immigrants would appreciate

144
00:05:22.7 --> 00:05:31.760
the details of course this was until

145
00:05:30.08 --> 00:05:34.160
this man you see on the screen right now

146
00:05:31.76 --> 00:05:35.180
came along of course I'm talking an alt

147
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:38.379
Carl Laemmle

148
00:05:35.18 --> 00:05:38.379
[Music]

149
00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.029
Lema Lee he was one of those German

150
00:05:42.05 --> 00:05:46.189
immigrants he worked at a Nickelodeon in

151
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.719
Chicago business it was great

152
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.029
but he was sick of paying so much money

153
00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.979
if ever since movies so he asked himself

154
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:56.380
the question well could as I make my own

155
00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:58.300
movies fans well yes he absolutely could

156
00:05:56.38 --> 00:06:00.580
[Music]

157
00:05:58.3 --> 00:06:02.290
and also Len Lee he new are the

158
00:06:00.58 --> 00:06:04.630
Nickelodeon owners all of them were

159
00:06:02.29 --> 00:06:07.090
immigrants too as they knew the tastes

160
00:06:04.63 --> 00:06:08.440
and aspirations of their audiences they

161
00:06:07.09 --> 00:06:10.240
knew that movies they could become

162
00:06:08.44 --> 00:06:11.950
something much more than just cheap

163
00:06:10.24 --> 00:06:14.920
jokes and girls with not very many

164
00:06:11.95 --> 00:06:17.850
clothes they could create stars like

165
00:06:14.92 --> 00:06:17.850
those seen on Broadway

166
00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.380
these cinema pioneers were the first

167
00:06:24.37 --> 00:06:28.960
ones to include the actor's name on the

168
00:06:26.38 --> 00:06:30.580
posters and in the credits this way many

169
00:06:28.96 --> 00:06:32.830
more artists were willing to work for

170
00:06:30.58 --> 00:06:34.720
them their films became famous among

171
00:06:32.83 --> 00:06:36.880
immigrants who came they came from all

172
00:06:34.72 --> 00:06:43.300
over the world and this is why they

173
00:06:36.88 --> 00:06:44.830
named their company Universal as you

174
00:06:43.3 --> 00:06:46.389
could imagine these success of this new

175
00:06:44.83 --> 00:06:48.190
company they'd inspired others to follow

176
00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.380
suit for instance and other Hungarian

177
00:06:48.19 --> 00:06:51.970
immigrant named Adolph zuker made

178
00:06:50.38 --> 00:06:54.100
another partnership with other

179
00:06:51.97 --> 00:06:56.020
Nickelodeon owners and started another

180
00:06:54.1 --> 00:06:58.510
studio which was called Paramount

181
00:06:56.02 --> 00:07:00.610
Pictures suddenly New York and in

182
00:06:58.51 --> 00:07:03.290
general the East Coast became sort of a

183
00:07:00.61 --> 00:07:06.419
primitive version of Hollywood's

184
00:07:03.29 --> 00:07:06.419
[Applause]

185
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:11.269
but all done for estimate because Thomas

186
00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.849
Edison well he was not willing to lose

187
00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:16.909
this battle don't forget he had the fame

188
00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:19.069
the money and the patents so in less

189
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:22.639
than five years lonely and his partners

190
00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.229
faced over 200 lawsuits the same happens

191
00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:28.089
with the rest of the small studios and

192
00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.089
as well many of them went bankrupt

193
00:07:29.71 --> 00:07:34.870
oh yeah this was a pretty bad time for

194
00:07:32.8 --> 00:07:38.490
movie studios bad there was pretty much

195
00:07:34.87 --> 00:07:38.490
a golden era for lawyers

196
00:07:41.35 --> 00:07:46.390
and if all of this was not enough Edison

197
00:07:44.35 --> 00:07:48.250
had enough power to force all of the

198
00:07:46.39 --> 00:07:51.340
Nickelodeon's from New York and Chicago

199
00:07:48.25 --> 00:07:53.380
to sign exclusivity contracts if they

200
00:07:51.34 --> 00:07:56.270
wanted Edison's technology they couldn't

201
00:07:53.38 --> 00:07:58.560
buy movies from his rivals

202
00:07:56.27 --> 00:08:00.360
and well this is the moment when our

203
00:07:58.56 --> 00:08:02.790
friend Carl Laemmle asked himself

204
00:08:00.36 --> 00:08:04.830
another important question well why

205
00:08:02.79 --> 00:08:06.810
should I stay on the East Coast Edison

206
00:08:04.83 --> 00:08:09.090
he was a powerful man indeed but his

207
00:08:06.81 --> 00:08:11.070
influence didn't reach everywhere there

208
00:08:09.09 --> 00:08:16.320
was a place far out of his reach and

209
00:08:11.07 --> 00:08:18.330
that place it was California the birth

210
00:08:16.32 --> 00:08:20.340
of an industry in the year 1915

211
00:08:18.33 --> 00:08:22.230
California there was the place to be

212
00:08:20.34 --> 00:08:24.150
thousands of young immigrants the

213
00:08:22.23 --> 00:08:26.520
perfect audience for movies would arrive

214
00:08:24.15 --> 00:08:27.930
every year houses and properties were

215
00:08:26.52 --> 00:08:30.300
cheaper than anywhere else in America

216
00:08:27.93 --> 00:08:32.460
and as if this was not enough the

217
00:08:30.3 --> 00:08:33.870
weather was pretty fantastic in New York

218
00:08:32.46 --> 00:08:35.490
it rains every other day so if you

219
00:08:33.87 --> 00:08:37.409
wanted to make movies you'd better have

220
00:08:35.49 --> 00:08:39.570
a studio and spend thousands of dollars

221
00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.070
on lights in California there's plenty

222
00:08:39.57 --> 00:08:44.390
of sunshine all year round so it's

223
00:08:41.07 --> 00:08:44.390
really easy to shoot outside

224
00:08:44.68 --> 00:08:49.579
[Music]

225
00:08:46.97 --> 00:08:51.889
this is why all those big studios from

226
00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:53.720
New York and Chicago moved into a

227
00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:56.180
neighborhood on the outskirts of Los

228
00:08:53.72 --> 00:08:57.589
Angeles a small suburb with little more

229
00:08:56.18 --> 00:09:00.110
than 500 inhabitants

230
00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:04.089
and as you probably guessed by now well

231
00:09:00.11 --> 00:09:04.089
that tiny place it was Hollywood

232
00:09:05.05 --> 00:09:09.550
but the story it doesn't end here you

233
00:09:07.99 --> 00:09:11.800
might now be wondering well how did

234
00:09:09.55 --> 00:09:12.550
California conquer audiences all around

235
00:09:11.8 --> 00:09:14.050
the world

236
00:09:12.55 --> 00:09:15.850
I mean don't forget that back in the day

237
00:09:14.05 --> 00:09:17.470
the United States it wasn't the big

238
00:09:15.85 --> 00:09:19.300
powerhouse that it would become later

239
00:09:17.47 --> 00:09:21.160
and don't forget countries like France

240
00:09:19.3 --> 00:09:23.500
countries like Denmark they already had

241
00:09:21.16 --> 00:09:26.320
a well-funded industry so why did

242
00:09:23.5 --> 00:09:28.720
Hollywood achieve it so much success and

243
00:09:26.32 --> 00:09:30.339
do it so quickly while the answer lies

244
00:09:28.72 --> 00:09:31.690
in something called the network effects

245
00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:33.040
and if you've been subscribed to this

246
00:09:31.69 --> 00:09:34.839
channel for a while you should do that

247
00:09:33.04 --> 00:09:36.459
by the way then the chances are even

248
00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:38.350
know what this thing is all those

249
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:40.420
Hollywood studios attracted the best

250
00:09:38.35 --> 00:09:43.230
investors and professionals from all

251
00:09:40.42 --> 00:09:43.230
around the globe

252
00:09:43.89 --> 00:09:49.570
this explains why in 1915 Hollywood was

253
00:09:47.89 --> 00:09:52.240
the setting for the first super

254
00:09:49.57 --> 00:09:55.120
production in history The Birth of a

255
00:09:52.24 --> 00:09:56.860
Nation the cost around $100,000 at that

256
00:09:55.12 --> 00:09:58.540
time as an aside here by the way this

257
00:09:56.86 --> 00:10:00.760
movie it was extremely controversial

258
00:09:58.54 --> 00:10:03.070
because essentially it portrayed the KKK

259
00:10:00.76 --> 00:10:04.990
as the good guys but I mean that's an

260
00:10:03.07 --> 00:10:06.970
entire story for a different day the

261
00:10:04.99 --> 00:10:08.890
truth is that in less than ten years the

262
00:10:06.97 --> 00:10:11.529
population of Hollywood grew to more

263
00:10:08.89 --> 00:10:13.060
than 30,000 inhabitants most of them

264
00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:15.010
they were immigrants like Francisco

265
00:10:13.06 --> 00:10:18.480
Elias this valiant he came to Hollywood

266
00:10:15.01 --> 00:10:18.480
to work as a production assistant

267
00:10:19.84 --> 00:10:24.100
soon he realized he could translate the

268
00:10:21.94 --> 00:10:26.410
titles of movies into Spanish this way

269
00:10:24.1 --> 00:10:28.300
he could export them to Spain and Latin

270
00:10:26.41 --> 00:10:30.160
America other immigrants with other

271
00:10:28.3 --> 00:10:31.780
mother tongues did the same and all of a

272
00:10:30.16 --> 00:10:38.980
sudden Hollywood movies could be

273
00:10:31.78 --> 00:10:40.210
understood everywhere but hold on just a

274
00:10:38.98 --> 00:10:42.100
second because I can guess what you're

275
00:10:40.21 --> 00:10:43.990
thinking well what happens to the movies

276
00:10:42.1 --> 00:10:45.640
when they have sound well actually this

277
00:10:43.99 --> 00:10:48.430
is a crucial turning points in the

278
00:10:45.64 --> 00:10:51.550
history of American movies eyeblood our

279
00:10:48.43 --> 00:10:53.170
Lord will reign let's have a great Vic

280
00:10:51.55 --> 00:10:55.180
as an example during the times of Nazi

281
00:10:53.17 --> 00:10:57.550
Germany the government there invested a

282
00:10:55.18 --> 00:10:59.800
fortune in subsidizing German studios

283
00:10:57.55 --> 00:11:01.270
and of course those companies tried to

284
00:10:59.8 --> 00:11:03.250
export their films to other countries

285
00:11:01.27 --> 00:11:05.950
like Spain Spain under the dictatorship

286
00:11:03.25 --> 00:11:08.140
of Francisco Franco was a close ally of

287
00:11:05.95 --> 00:11:09.970
the Third Reich nonetheless almost no

288
00:11:08.14 --> 00:11:12.130
Spanish movie theatres projected a

289
00:11:09.97 --> 00:11:14.200
German movie that's why was this well

290
00:11:12.13 --> 00:11:16.630
the reason is not as idealistic as you

291
00:11:14.2 --> 00:11:18.610
might hope it was a pure technological

292
00:11:16.63 --> 00:11:20.410
reason German studios sent their movies

293
00:11:18.61 --> 00:11:26.470
in the German language and they didn't

294
00:11:20.41 --> 00:11:28.390
have good systems Dublin hell Michel

295
00:11:26.47 --> 00:11:29.980
Hollywood studios instead had

296
00:11:28.39 --> 00:11:31.750
state-of-the-art methods for dubbing

297
00:11:29.98 --> 00:11:33.790
Plus since they had such a high

298
00:11:31.75 --> 00:11:35.350
immigrant population it was easier for

299
00:11:33.79 --> 00:11:37.330
them to find translators and voice

300
00:11:35.35 --> 00:11:39.010
actors some countries even had their own

301
00:11:37.33 --> 00:11:40.930
offices in Spain so they sent the

302
00:11:39.01 --> 00:11:44.950
celluloid ready to be replaced with the

303
00:11:40.93 --> 00:11:46.750
Spanish audio track ganga jamuna la mano

304
00:11:44.95 --> 00:11:56.800
Nera scene disparity there are nobody

305
00:11:46.75 --> 00:11:58.600
give a car scene Mattel thing in other

306
00:11:56.8 --> 00:12:00.370
words American movies were cheaper to

307
00:11:58.6 --> 00:12:02.290
project than those from any other

308
00:12:00.37 --> 00:12:04.300
country add this to the peerless talent

309
00:12:02.29 --> 00:12:06.190
of those movie geniuses like John Ford

310
00:12:04.3 --> 00:12:08.170
who came from Ireland and Ernst Lubitsch

311
00:12:06.19 --> 00:12:10.060
who came from Germany those were the

312
00:12:08.17 --> 00:12:12.040
ultimate weapons that row of America to

313
00:12:10.06 --> 00:12:14.550
surpass any other country's movie

314
00:12:12.04 --> 00:12:14.550
industry

315
00:12:14.84 --> 00:12:22.760
I said you Liberty you pick it up so oh

316
00:12:20.75 --> 00:12:24.560
yes Hollywood was born thanks to those

317
00:12:22.76 --> 00:12:26.780
who came from outside America and

318
00:12:24.56 --> 00:12:28.610
Hollywood grew up thanks to selling

319
00:12:26.78 --> 00:12:33.410
their movies to the people outside of

320
00:12:28.61 --> 00:12:34.700
America and here it's really important

321
00:12:33.41 --> 00:12:36.620
that I make an aside in case you've

322
00:12:34.7 --> 00:12:38.450
never heard about John fort do yourself

323
00:12:36.62 --> 00:12:40.520
a favor and watch the man who shot

324
00:12:38.45 --> 00:12:41.960
Liberty valance it's a wonderful film

325
00:12:40.52 --> 00:12:48.590
and despite the black and white it

326
00:12:41.96 --> 00:12:50.600
hasn't aged between and now the question

327
00:12:48.59 --> 00:12:52.790
might be what happens after all of this

328
00:12:50.6 --> 00:12:55.190
how did Hollywood survive the censorship

329
00:12:52.79 --> 00:12:57.500
and piracy that came later if you would

330
00:12:55.19 --> 00:12:58.850
like us to tell you that story do let us

331
00:12:57.5 --> 00:12:59.570
know in the comments below we'd love to

332

hear from you

333
00:12:59.57 --> 00:13:03.590
meanwhile in this other video we tell
