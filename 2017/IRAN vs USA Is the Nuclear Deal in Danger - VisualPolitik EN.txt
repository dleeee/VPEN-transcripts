3
00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.380
just before we get into the video today

4
00:00:09.45 --> 00:00:12.269
do you want to say that I've recently

5
00:00:10.38 --> 00:00:14.700
started a new channel it's called by

6
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.100
graphics we do long-form 20 minutes ish

7
00:00:14.7 --> 00:00:18.690
biographies of people from history as

8
00:00:17.1 --> 00:00:20.070
well as the present-day politicians but

9
00:00:18.69 --> 00:00:21.750
a whole lot else please check out the

10
00:00:20.07 --> 00:00:23.250
link in the description below and if you

11
00:00:21.75 --> 00:00:25.080
like bio graphics please subscribe

12
00:00:23.25 --> 00:00:26.910
anyway while everybody has their eyes on

13
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:28.769
North Korea another nuclear program

14
00:00:26.91 --> 00:00:31.109
still worries those in the White House

15
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.390
that is the nuclear program of the

16
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.250
Islamic Republic of Iran this country

17
00:00:36.39 --> 00:00:39.660
has such a bad reputation then when we

18
00:00:38.25 --> 00:00:41.100
talk about it it can feel like we're

19
00:00:39.66 --> 00:00:43.530
talking about one of those places that

20
00:00:41.1 --> 00:00:45.989
only exists in the movies one of those

21
00:00:43.53 --> 00:00:48.690
countries dominated by evil leaders who

22
00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
dream of destroying the world well there

23
00:00:48.69 --> 00:00:53.219
might actually be some truth to this but

24
00:00:50.82 --> 00:00:55.649
definitely not as much as some seem to

25
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.940
think in fact Iran is not the most

26
00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.920
religious it's not the most

27
00:00:56.94 --> 00:01:01.230
authoritarian and it's not even the most

28
00:00:58.92 --> 00:01:03.059
hostile place towards women in this part

29
00:01:01.23 --> 00:01:06.479
of the world because we have Saudi

30
00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.880
Arabia which is far far worse give you a

31
00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.619
Iran it is a country of contradictions a

32
00:01:08.88 --> 00:01:12.570
country whose government aims to work

33
00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.010
under a democratic system but at the

34
00:01:12.57 --> 00:01:16.430
same time everything is under the

35
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:18.740
control of one man

36
00:01:16.43 --> 00:01:26.600
that man would be alley hominy the

37
00:01:18.74 --> 00:01:28.520
supreme leader even though her first

38
00:01:26.6 --> 00:01:31.100
glance isn't as scary as his predecessor

39
00:01:28.52 --> 00:01:33.290
Ruhollah Khomeini who was scary just to

40
00:01:31.1 --> 00:01:35.510
look at the truth is how many you can't

41
00:01:33.29 --> 00:01:37.250
stand anything modern for him modernity

42
00:01:35.51 --> 00:01:39.350
might as well have come from Satan

43
00:01:37.25 --> 00:01:41.350
himself of the except for nuclear

44
00:01:39.35 --> 00:01:44.840
technology of course

45
00:01:41.35 --> 00:01:47.030
[Music]

46
00:01:44.84 --> 00:01:49.219
that explains why in the past few years

47
00:01:47.03 --> 00:01:51.469
Iran has been famous for two things

48
00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.450
number one being one of the countries

49
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.729
alongside China where the most people

50
00:01:53.45 --> 00:01:58.520
are executed every year and number two

51
00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.710
wanting to build their own nuclear bomb

52
00:01:58.52 --> 00:02:03.860
however unlike what has happens with the

53
00:02:00.71 --> 00:02:09.140
North Korean crisis the US and Iran they

54
00:02:03.86 --> 00:02:11.209
did reach an agreement in 2015 President

55
00:02:09.14 --> 00:02:13.459
Obama led the joint comprehensive plan

56
00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.379
of action and agreements to prevent Iran

57
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.940
from obtaining a nuclear bomb as in

58
00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.099
agreements that many have considered to

59
00:02:16.94 --> 00:02:21.260
be one of the greatest achievements in

60
00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.420
all of foreign policy it's now more than

61
00:02:21.26 --> 00:02:25.849
50 years since President Kennedy stood

62
00:02:23.42 --> 00:02:28.099
before the American people and said let

63
00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.049
us never negotiate out of fear but let

64
00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.450
us never fear to negotiate

65
00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.590
although to be fair all signs seemed to

66
00:02:32.45 --> 00:02:35.840
point to the conclusion that this

67
00:02:33.59 --> 00:02:38.260
agreement has not kept either party

68
00:02:35.84 --> 00:02:40.390
satisfied

69
00:02:38.26 --> 00:02:42.549
President of the United States now

70
00:02:40.39 --> 00:02:44.440
Donald Trump is pretty clear about his

71
00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.629
opinion on the deal ever since he was a

72
00:02:44.44 --> 00:02:49.360
candidate he has described it as the

73
00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.220
worst agreement ever negotiated during

74
00:02:49.36 --> 00:02:53.409
his campaign Trump has vowed on many

75
00:02:51.22 --> 00:02:55.269
many occasions that his top priority

76
00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.519
would be to put an end to such a

77
00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.920
catastrophic agreements I've been doing

78
00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.230
deals for a long time I've been making

79
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:07.390
lots of wonderful deals great deals

80
00:03:02.23 --> 00:03:11.440
that's what I do never ever ever in my

81
00:03:07.39 --> 00:03:14.470
life have I seen any transaction so

82
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:16.510
incompetently negotiated as our deal

83
00:03:14.47 --> 00:03:18.459
with Iran and do you not think that this

84
00:03:16.51 --> 00:03:20.440
was the typical campaign message that

85
00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.420
every politician repeats over over again

86
00:03:20.44 --> 00:03:24.340
but then soon forgets about well once

87
00:03:22.42 --> 00:03:26.650
the election has finished in his first

88
00:03:24.34 --> 00:03:29.709
speech at the UN assembly Trump repeated

89
00:03:26.65 --> 00:03:31.709
it loud and clear the Iran deal was one

90
00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.609
of the worst and most one-sided

91
00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:39.700
transactions the United States has ever

92
00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.340
entered into frankly that deal is an

93
00:03:39.7 --> 00:03:44.709
embarrassment to the United States and I

94
00:03:42.34 --> 00:03:47.500
don't think you've heard the last of it

95
00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.389
believe me they haven't done so yes but

96
00:03:47.5 --> 00:03:50.919
it is true that both the presidents and

97
00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.500
many other members of the Republican

98
00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.329
Party loathe yes absolutely loathe

99
00:03:53.5 --> 00:03:57.549
disagreements and they do so because

100
00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.310
among other things agreements were also

101
00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.889
signed with North Korea this is a good

102
00:04:00.31 --> 00:04:04.569
deal for the United States North Korea

103
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.180
will freeze and then dismantle its

104
00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.040
nuclear program South Korea and our

105
00:04:07.18 --> 00:04:11.769
other allies will be better protected

106
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:13.209
and well these agreements they didn't

107
00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.760
work at all except for allowing

108
00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.989
Pyongyang to lay their hands on the bomb

109
00:04:15.76 --> 00:04:18.940
well now you might be wondering why

110
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.829
exactly is it such a controversial

111
00:04:18.94 --> 00:04:22.539
agreements well we're going to look at

112
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.490
that in a bit before we do let's take a

113
00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.940
look at the context in which it was

114
00:04:24.49 --> 00:04:26.940
signed

115
00:04:31.86 --> 00:04:38.580
Iran a budding superpower

116
00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.800
so during the Cold War it is said that

117
00:04:38.58 --> 00:04:43.199
the Russians were so obsessed that they

118
00:04:40.8 --> 00:04:45.389
saw a Chinese man behind every tree

119
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.879
something similar might now actually be

120
00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.469
happening between Iran and the USA since

121
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.990
the Islamic Revolution of command-i in

122
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.449
1979 Iran has become one of Washington's

123
00:04:54.99 --> 00:04:59.999
worst enemies it is accused Tehran of

124
00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.619
being the first sponsor of radical and

125
00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.020
anti-american groups like Hezbollah

126
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:06.240
Hamas or Fatah Labatt not mentioned

127
00:05:04.02 --> 00:05:08.789
their support of the Syrian regime under

128
00:05:06.24 --> 00:05:10.499
Bashar al-assad but there is more to

129
00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:14.930
this Washington knows very well that

130
00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.930
Iran it's not just any country

131
00:05:16.7 --> 00:05:21.720
look Iran is absolutely huge it's got 80

132
00:05:20.07 --> 00:05:24.000
million inhabitants and one of the

133
00:05:21.72 --> 00:05:26.070
greatest amounts of mineral wealth on

134
00:05:24.0 --> 00:05:27.750
earth and hey it's not just about oil

135
00:05:26.07 --> 00:05:29.610
and natural gas here but it's also got

136
00:05:27.75 --> 00:05:33.380
other minerals like copper iron zinc

137
00:05:29.61 --> 00:05:33.380
uranium silver etc

138
00:05:34.59 --> 00:05:37.690
[Music]

139
00:05:37.75 --> 00:05:41.980
but yes we do all know that all other

140
00:05:40.15 --> 00:05:44.620
natural gas spell they're particularly

141
00:05:41.98 --> 00:05:46.480
important and that is why I now want to

142
00:05:44.62 --> 00:05:49.630
ask you a question what is the biggest

143
00:05:46.48 --> 00:05:53.380
fear of many analysts in Washington well

144
00:05:49.63 --> 00:05:55.330
that is the son of Iraq and Iran

145
00:05:53.38 --> 00:05:57.490
let me explain both countries their

146
00:05:55.33 --> 00:06:00.190
neighbors have a majority Shiite rule

147
00:05:57.49 --> 00:06:05.350
and influence of Tehran on Baghdad has

148
00:06:00.19 --> 00:06:07.060
skyrocketed in the last few years we add

149
00:06:05.35 --> 00:06:09.070
up the oil reserves of both countries

150
00:06:07.06 --> 00:06:11.320
the amount is one of the largest in the

151
00:06:09.07 --> 00:06:12.700
world it's larger than Saudi Arabia it's

152
00:06:11.32 --> 00:06:14.770
larger than Venezuela

153
00:06:12.7 --> 00:06:16.660
so coordinated international politics

154
00:06:14.77 --> 00:06:19.090
between these two countries would result

155
00:06:16.66 --> 00:06:20.860
in a superpower which is outside the

156
00:06:19.09 --> 00:06:23.530
control of Washington with almost a

157
00:06:20.86 --> 00:06:25.000
hundred and twenty million people and

158
00:06:23.53 --> 00:06:27.370
that's not mentioning all of those other

159
00:06:25.0 --> 00:06:29.140
natural resources this quite simply

160
00:06:27.37 --> 00:06:31.390
would be an incredible amount of

161
00:06:29.14 --> 00:06:34.270
influence so then what would happen if

162
00:06:31.39 --> 00:06:35.560
Iran got a hold of a nuclear bomb now on

163
00:06:34.27 --> 00:06:37.720
the one hand it would certainly

164
00:06:35.56 --> 00:06:39.669
consolidate its role as an international

165
00:06:37.72 --> 00:06:41.860
superpower as well as its influence over

166
00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.840
its allies like Iraq but on the other

167
00:06:41.86 --> 00:06:46.510
hand it would also trigger an arms race

168
00:06:43.84 --> 00:06:48.340
with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates that

169
00:06:46.51 --> 00:06:50.680
have already said they won't be left

170
00:06:48.34 --> 00:06:54.250
behind if Tehran manages to get a

171
00:06:50.68 --> 00:06:56.140
nuclear bomb and the result of all this

172
00:06:54.25 --> 00:06:57.790
was pretty obvious it's tension it's

173
00:06:56.14 --> 00:07:00.370
risk of proliferation it's risk of

174
00:06:57.79 --> 00:07:02.350
nuclear disaster and also a loss of

175
00:07:00.37 --> 00:07:04.390
American leverage in the area it goes

176
00:07:02.35 --> 00:07:05.830
without saying that seeing such radical

177
00:07:04.39 --> 00:07:07.780
governments in possession of such

178
00:07:05.83 --> 00:07:10.240
powerful weapons or say doesn't make

179
00:07:07.78 --> 00:07:12.160
anyone feel particularly safe well that

180
00:07:10.24 --> 00:07:14.010
was the situation when the agreement was

181
00:07:12.16 --> 00:07:17.660
reached back in 2015

182
00:07:14.01 --> 00:07:20.960
[Music]

183
00:07:17.66 --> 00:07:20.960
the deal

184
00:07:21.31 --> 00:07:25.940
for years the United States is trying to

185
00:07:24.11 --> 00:07:27.860
stop the nuclear program with financial

186
00:07:25.94 --> 00:07:30.050
penalties that these were pretty done

187
00:07:27.86 --> 00:07:31.910
useless didn't they hum the economy in

188
00:07:30.05 --> 00:07:37.700
Iran well absolutely but they did

189
00:07:31.91 --> 00:07:39.710
nothing to stop their nuclear program so

190
00:07:37.7 --> 00:07:42.410
finally on November the 14th of July

191
00:07:39.71 --> 00:07:44.930
2015 the nuclear deal it was signed an

192
00:07:42.41 --> 00:07:47.000
agreement with a clear target to prevent

193
00:07:44.93 --> 00:07:49.580
proliferation and make sure Iran only

194
00:07:47.0 --> 00:07:52.400
uses nuclear technology for peaceful

195
00:07:49.58 --> 00:07:54.080
purposes however since then the deal it

196
00:07:52.4 --> 00:07:55.250
has suffered harsh attacks we're going

197
00:07:54.08 --> 00:07:57.110
to have a look at some of the reasons

198
00:07:55.25 --> 00:07:59.300
cited by critics of this agreement but

199
00:07:57.11 --> 00:08:00.920
first I think now is a good time to

200
00:07:59.3 --> 00:08:03.080
think about the circumstances under

201
00:08:00.92 --> 00:08:04.490
which this agreement was signed and the

202
00:08:03.08 --> 00:08:07.100
first thing we need to note is that the

203
00:08:04.49 --> 00:08:13.280
nuclear program in Iran is very very

204
00:08:07.1 --> 00:08:15.140
advanced according to US intelligence if

205
00:08:13.28 --> 00:08:17.300
the agreement was to be broken Iran

206
00:08:15.14 --> 00:08:20.600
could develop its first nuclear bomb in

207
00:08:17.3 --> 00:08:23.390
a matter of months this is the way it is

208
00:08:20.6 --> 00:08:25.970
today 2017 and it was even truer back in

209
00:08:23.39 --> 00:08:28.190
2015 when the Iranian program was

210
00:08:25.97 --> 00:08:29.570
working on its fullest capacity that is

211
00:08:28.19 --> 00:08:31.790
why I want to take a moment to think

212
00:08:29.57 --> 00:08:33.910
about three possible outcomes here war

213
00:08:31.79 --> 00:08:36.910
agreements or Iran with nuclear

214
00:08:33.91 --> 00:08:36.910
capability

215
00:08:38.58 --> 00:08:43.050
so stopping the nuclear program with

216
00:08:40.89 --> 00:08:45.029
military intervention it would not have

217
00:08:43.05 --> 00:08:46.980
been an easy task it would have resulted

218
00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:48.510
in many victims the cost for the u.s.

219
00:08:46.98 --> 00:08:49.890
would have been prohibitive and the u.s.

220
00:08:48.51 --> 00:08:51.570
who have had to keep in military

221
00:08:49.89 --> 00:08:54.089
intervention in the Middle East for

222
00:08:51.57 --> 00:08:57.149
decades to compare it is estimated that

223
00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:59.850
this would be the Iraq war multiplied by

224
00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:01.649
five because I mean it's one thing to

225
00:08:59.85 --> 00:09:03.600
destroy infrastructure and it's a very

226
00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.310
different thing to eliminate the

227
00:09:03.6 --> 00:09:07.410
knowledge that a country has to make

228
00:09:05.31 --> 00:09:09.750
nuclear bombs Obama knew that this

229
00:09:07.41 --> 00:09:11.430
situation was totally impossible what he

230
00:09:09.75 --> 00:09:12.870
wanted was to get away from the Middle

231
00:09:11.43 --> 00:09:15.240
East and not get into any more trouble

232
00:09:12.87 --> 00:09:17.100
in this region because it's been

233
00:09:15.24 --> 00:09:22.290
something of a chronic nightmare for the

234
00:09:17.1 --> 00:09:23.550
United States but sure on the other

235
00:09:22.29 --> 00:09:25.079
hands not doing anything would have

236
00:09:23.55 --> 00:09:26.730
meant that Iran we've got in their new

237
00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:28.320
time and as we have seen it would have

238
00:09:26.73 --> 00:09:30.990
resulted in an arms race in the region

239
00:09:28.32 --> 00:09:32.760
which Washington didn't want either so

240
00:09:30.99 --> 00:09:34.829
an agreement it was the only option left

241
00:09:32.76 --> 00:09:37.589
I mean we make a deal meant everyone's

242
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:39.450
happy right just wait there a second

243
00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:41.760
because despite that many experts

244
00:09:39.45 --> 00:09:43.829
especially your Republicans don't even

245
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:47.010
want to hear about this pact this is a

246
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:49.680
bad deal Obama broke every rule of

247
00:09:47.01 --> 00:09:51.870
negotiation we get an agreement a very

248
00:09:49.68 --> 00:09:53.850
questionable value if I am elected

249
00:09:51.87 --> 00:09:56.579
president on the very first day in

250
00:09:53.85 --> 00:09:58.740
office I will rip to shreds this

251
00:09:56.579 --> 00:10:01.020
catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal what

252
00:09:58.74 --> 00:10:04.829
the Iranians have been given a blank

253
00:10:01.02 --> 00:10:06.870
cheque basically by by the president

254
00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:09.029
invited States so I think all just war

255
00:10:06.87 --> 00:10:11.700
hawks determined to impose their ideas

256
00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:13.500
by force well maybe there are some like

257
00:10:11.7 --> 00:10:15.630
that but the truth is they also have a

258
00:10:13.5 --> 00:10:17.459
point they say and they are right that

259
00:10:15.63 --> 00:10:19.709
the u.s. already signs many agreements

260
00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:21.959
with North Korea and Pyongyang never

261
00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:23.970
kept its words which is why North Korea

262
00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:25.800
is now a nuclear power they are

263
00:10:23.97 --> 00:10:27.300
convinced that Iran will do the same and

264
00:10:25.8 --> 00:10:29.220
there is no better evidence than the

265
00:10:27.3 --> 00:10:32.070
facts that Iran has not stopped their

266
00:10:29.22 --> 00:10:34.020
ballistic missile program Iran is

267
00:10:32.07 --> 00:10:36.810
boosting its missile capabilities in

268
00:10:34.02 --> 00:10:40.680
order to increase the accuracy precision

269
00:10:36.81 --> 00:10:42.930
and range Iran will not stop its missile

270
00:10:40.68 --> 00:10:44.880
projects and this program what is being

271
00:10:42.93 --> 00:10:47.310
developed with North Korean technology

272
00:10:44.88 --> 00:10:48.480
so it seems clear which way a deal with

273
00:10:47.31 --> 00:10:53.390
Iran will go

274
00:10:48.48 --> 00:10:56.670
we cannot let a murderous regime

275
00:10:53.39 --> 00:11:00.270
continue these destabilizing activities

276
00:10:56.67 --> 00:11:03.180
while building dangerous missiles and we

277
00:11:00.27 --> 00:11:06.079
cannot abide by an agreement if it

278
00:11:03.18 --> 00:11:09.540
provides cover for the eventual

279
00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:11.819
construction of a nuclear program

280
00:11:09.54 --> 00:11:13.709
besides since the pact has a limited

281
00:11:11.819 --> 00:11:15.899
duration Iran could still put itself in

282
00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:17.490
a position to get its arsenal the moment

283
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:19.890
the deal is over and it could be armed

284
00:11:17.49 --> 00:11:21.300
within a matter of months however as we

285
00:11:19.89 --> 00:11:22.410
have seen the alternatives they're

286
00:11:21.3 --> 00:11:24.600
really not any better

287
00:11:22.41 --> 00:11:28.130
do they want Iran doesn't necessarily

288
00:11:24.6 --> 00:11:28.130
need to go the way of North Korea

289
00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:36.390
you're on benefits of the agreement I'm

290
00:11:34.89 --> 00:11:38.279
pretty sure many of you are thinking

291
00:11:36.39 --> 00:11:40.110
that comparing North Korea and Iran is

292
00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:42.480
easy after all both countries are

293
00:11:40.11 --> 00:11:44.699
radical dictatorships right well I mean

294
00:11:42.48 --> 00:11:46.890
not really to be third thinks they're

295
00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:49.110
quite a bit different Iranian society is

296
00:11:46.89 --> 00:11:50.910
much more open-minded than North Korean

297
00:11:49.11 --> 00:11:52.890
society in Iran there is a well formed

298
00:11:50.91 --> 00:11:54.810
middle class there are political debates

299
00:11:52.89 --> 00:11:55.709
and things like having a smartphone and

300
00:11:54.81 --> 00:11:57.839
access to the Internet

301
00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:59.610
it's really quite common in fact most

302
00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:02.160
Iranians especially the younger

303
00:11:59.61 --> 00:12:03.480
generation are clearly Pro agreement you

304
00:12:02.16 --> 00:12:05.610
see it's not just a matter of

305
00:12:03.48 --> 00:12:08.069
international politics it's also a

306
00:12:05.61 --> 00:12:09.810
matter of quality of life the penalty is

307
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:10.260
put in place by the international

308
00:12:09.81 --> 00:12:13.910
community

309
00:12:10.26 --> 00:12:13.910
they were very damaging for Iran

310
00:12:14.13 --> 00:12:18.960
look in 2013 when President

311
00:12:16.8 --> 00:12:21.000
Ahmadinejad's the main defender of the

312
00:12:18.96 --> 00:12:23.550
agreements left power the economy of

313
00:12:21.0 --> 00:12:24.120
Iran it was devastated for an investment

314
00:12:23.55 --> 00:12:26.070
vanished

315
00:12:24.12 --> 00:12:28.560
the unemployment rate skyrocketed

316
00:12:26.07 --> 00:12:30.630
inflation grew to around 40% and

317
00:12:28.56 --> 00:12:33.570
expectations for improvement weren't

318
00:12:30.63 --> 00:12:34.950
high in short it was a complete mess but

319
00:12:33.57 --> 00:12:36.930
thanks to the agreement the penalties

320
00:12:34.95 --> 00:12:38.670
that started to disappear and since then

321
00:12:36.93 --> 00:12:40.860
oil exports have tripled

322
00:12:38.67 --> 00:12:42.630
I mean Iraq it's not North Korea they

323
00:12:40.86 --> 00:12:44.280
need the trade and the economic

324
00:12:42.63 --> 00:12:48.000
advantages that this Agreement has

325
00:12:44.28 --> 00:12:50.370
brought the joint comprehensive plan of

326
00:12:48.0 --> 00:12:52.620
action will produce the comprehensive

327
00:12:50.37 --> 00:12:55.170
lifting of all UN Security Council

328
00:12:52.62 --> 00:12:57.180
sanctions as well as multilateral and

329
00:12:55.17 --> 00:12:59.970
national sanctions related to Iran's

330
00:12:57.18 --> 00:13:02.870
nuclear program including steps on

331
00:12:59.97 --> 00:13:06.060
access in areas of trade technology

332
00:13:02.87 --> 00:13:07.650
finance and energy the Obama's

333
00:13:06.06 --> 00:13:09.630
administration was that with a more

334
00:13:07.65 --> 00:13:11.460
prosperous and trade open Iran the

335
00:13:09.63 --> 00:13:13.110
younger more open-minded generation

336
00:13:11.46 --> 00:13:15.150
would be allowed to take power in a few

337
00:13:13.11 --> 00:13:17.010
years however those who oppose the

338
00:13:15.15 --> 00:13:18.570
agreements argue it's necessary to be

339
00:13:17.01 --> 00:13:19.920
more demanding with Iran because

340
00:13:18.57 --> 00:13:22.200
otherwise it will eventually become

341
00:13:19.92 --> 00:13:24.030
another North Korea and new nuclear

342
00:13:22.2 --> 00:13:26.430
power anyway it's not an easy situation

343
00:13:24.03 --> 00:13:28.440
as you can see but truth be told I think

344
00:13:26.43 --> 00:13:30.540
it would be a mistake to think that any

345
00:13:28.44 --> 00:13:32.730
pact is bad until proven otherwise

346
00:13:30.54 --> 00:13:34.830
having to run under pressure might be a

347
00:13:32.73 --> 00:13:37.650
good strategy for let's be careful not

348
00:13:34.83 --> 00:13:39.120
to go too far we could all lose well now

349
00:13:37.65 --> 00:13:40.980
it's your turn if you were the President

350
00:13:39.12 --> 00:13:42.720
of the United States what do you think

351
00:13:40.98 --> 00:13:44.160
you would do with Iran would you make a

352
00:13:42.72 --> 00:13:46.860
deal what leave your answer in the
