3
00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.360
in the last few years Chile has become

4
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
the Cristiano Ronaldo of Latin America

5
00:00:12.36 --> 00:00:16.379
it was the country with the highest

6
00:00:13.74 --> 00:00:18.180
growth had the most success and sticking

7
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.279
with our metaphor here it scored the

8
00:00:18.18 --> 00:00:22.020
most goals also so many classical

9
00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.480
liberals Chile has been the benchmark

10
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:26.340
for years we could say they considered

11
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:34.890
the Chilean model something was a dream

12
00:00:26.34 --> 00:00:36.809
in a world full of dark nightmares I was

13
00:00:34.89 --> 00:00:38.940
true that we could reason to celebration

14
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.559
Chile which once was the poorest Spanish

15
00:00:38.94 --> 00:00:42.360
country in Latin America became the

16
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.340
richest in the region it became the

17
00:00:42.36 --> 00:00:45.570
country with the highest life expectancy

18
00:00:44.34 --> 00:00:48.149
in the country with the best social

19
00:00:45.57 --> 00:00:50.219
services in the entire region it is true

20
00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.989
that inequality is very high in Chile

21
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.879
but the entire population of Chile has

22
00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.829
benefited from the prosperity that the

23
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
country has achieved over the past few

24
00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.899
decades for the past 25 years the income

25
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.760
of the poorest people in the country has

26
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.260
increased far more than the income of

27
00:01:02.76 --> 00:01:06.659
the wealthiest people and their

28
00:01:04.26 --> 00:01:07.409
purchasing power has grown six times

29
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.140
larger

30
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.180
all of this compares very favorably to

31
00:01:10.14 --> 00:01:14.490
other Latin American nations as an

32
00:01:12.18 --> 00:01:17.100
example in 1950 the average Chilean

33
00:01:14.49 --> 00:01:18.540
income was around a third of Venezuelan

34
00:01:17.1 --> 00:01:21.240
income in a manner of speaking

35
00:01:18.54 --> 00:01:23.159
Whalen's were three times richer a lot

36
00:01:21.24 --> 00:01:24.960
has changed since then and today

37
00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.659
Chileans are much richer than

38
00:01:24.96 --> 00:01:29.729
Venezuelans they also have a longer life

39
00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.860
expectancy a Chilean lives an average of

40
00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.460
eight years more than a person born in

41
00:01:31.86 --> 00:01:41.280
Venezuela now tearing Chile to Venezuela

42
00:01:38.46 --> 00:01:42.990
or Argentina sure makes Chile look good

43
00:01:41.28 --> 00:01:44.850
but when the comparison is made with

44
00:01:42.99 --> 00:01:47.369
other more distant countries for example

45
00:01:44.85 --> 00:01:49.979
those in Asia the figures aren't nearly

46
00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.899
so nice and further it seemed as if the

47
00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.829
country has stopped growing which is

48
00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.829
certainly worse

49
00:01:56.7 --> 00:02:03.940
the Chilean slowdown in the last few

50
00:02:01.63 --> 00:02:05.740
years the optimism and success well it's

51
00:02:03.94 --> 00:02:07.540
come to an end in Santiago the capital

52
00:02:05.74 --> 00:02:09.490
of the country for the displays of

53
00:02:07.54 --> 00:02:11.710
wealth and prosperity of left making

54
00:02:09.49 --> 00:02:14.050
room instead for demonstrations and

55
00:02:11.71 --> 00:02:19.180
protests anger and despair have taken

56
00:02:14.05 --> 00:02:21.010
over and well it's only logical economic

57
00:02:19.18 --> 00:02:24.190
growth has fallen to the last few years

58
00:02:21.01 --> 00:02:26.380
and in 2016 unemployment increased while

59
00:02:24.19 --> 00:02:28.480
salaries remained frozen further the

60
00:02:26.38 --> 00:02:30.550
youth can't find jobs in both investment

61
00:02:28.48 --> 00:02:32.350
and exports have fallen and the thing is

62
00:02:30.55 --> 00:02:33.340
that things aren't looking like they're

63
00:02:32.35 --> 00:02:38.110
going to get any better

64
00:02:33.34 --> 00:02:41.230
anytime soon 2016 the Chilean economy

65
00:02:38.11 --> 00:02:43.660
grew by 1.5 percent Chile central bank's

66
00:02:41.23 --> 00:02:44.080
forecasts for 2017 are not a whole lot

67
00:02:43.66 --> 00:02:48.459
better

68
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:50.350
increasing to 2% from 1% and despite all

69
00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.360
of the growth of the last decades three

70
00:02:50.35 --> 00:02:54.790
out of every four Chileans make less

71
00:02:52.36 --> 00:02:56.620
than $700 a month so now you can

72
00:02:54.79 --> 00:02:58.600
probably understand their anger these

73
00:02:56.62 --> 00:03:00.519
are the salaries that belong to a rich

74
00:02:58.6 --> 00:03:02.050
country so all in all the Chilean model

75
00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.850
seems to be failing and there is one

76
00:03:02.05 --> 00:03:06.340
person who is responsible for this

77
00:03:03.85 --> 00:03:11.560
slowdown and that's Nickelback alas the

78
00:03:06.34 --> 00:03:15.280
current president of Chile the

79
00:03:11.56 --> 00:03:16.540
revolution of Bachelet the chellb

80
00:03:15.28 --> 00:03:19.930
accolade with the President of Chile

81
00:03:16.54 --> 00:03:21.760
from March 2006 to March 2010 but in

82
00:03:19.93 --> 00:03:23.320
Chile a president can't be elected to

83
00:03:21.76 --> 00:03:25.090
two consecutive terms

84
00:03:23.32 --> 00:03:27.130
so bachelors have to wait four years

85
00:03:25.09 --> 00:03:29.380
before she could run again for La Moneda

86
00:03:27.13 --> 00:03:31.269
the name of the presidential palace in

87
00:03:29.38 --> 00:03:33.100
Chile well after gaining the support of

88
00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.780
almost all the left-wing parties

89
00:03:33.1 --> 00:03:36.640
including the Socialist Party in the

90
00:03:34.78 --> 00:03:39.519
Communist Party back Alette won the

91
00:03:36.64 --> 00:03:42.130
elections in November of 2013 and a few

92
00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.530
months later in March of 2014 she became

93
00:03:42.13 --> 00:03:46.330
the president of the Republic of Chile

94
00:03:44.53 --> 00:03:49.250
again

95
00:03:46.33 --> 00:03:50.840
in the second term bacala decided to go

96
00:03:49.25 --> 00:03:52.370
through with reforms which were much

97
00:03:50.84 --> 00:03:54.410
more aggressive than the ones she came

98
00:03:52.37 --> 00:03:56.390
up with her first time around her first

99
00:03:54.41 --> 00:03:59.300
decision was to increase taxation on

100
00:03:56.39 --> 00:04:01.580
companies by almost 40 percent quite a

101
00:03:59.3 --> 00:04:03.860
dramatic move he did it by raising rates

102
00:04:01.58 --> 00:04:05.720
on profits and also by eliminating a

103
00:04:03.86 --> 00:04:08.180
bonus which meant companies could reduce

104
00:04:05.72 --> 00:04:12.320
taxation if the profits were reinvested

105
00:04:08.18 --> 00:04:14.510
in Chile if you think about it that rule

106
00:04:12.32 --> 00:04:16.459
about reinvestment was actually a really

107
00:04:14.51 --> 00:04:18.500
reasonable incentive a country like

108
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.989
Chile which is far from being rich needs

109
00:04:18.5 --> 00:04:22.820
factories machines businesses technology

110
00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.890
and investment and this incentive

111
00:04:22.82 --> 00:04:26.840
encouraged the growth of all of these

112
00:04:24.89 --> 00:04:29.090
things so the question is what's the

113
00:04:26.84 --> 00:04:30.950
point of punishing companies providing

114
00:04:29.09 --> 00:04:32.390
this much-needed investment and in

115
00:04:30.95 --> 00:04:34.010
addition to all of this taxation on

116
00:04:32.39 --> 00:04:35.780
companies that wasn't exactly low to

117
00:04:34.01 --> 00:04:37.700
begin with take a look at how things are

118
00:04:35.78 --> 00:04:39.890
now after Bachelet has punished these

119
00:04:37.7 --> 00:04:42.680
companies Chile has the second highest

120
00:04:39.89 --> 00:04:45.740
corporate taxes in the world surpassed

121
00:04:42.68 --> 00:04:48.050
only by Japan a much richer country with

122
00:04:45.74 --> 00:04:49.760
much larger companies and would you like

123
00:04:48.05 --> 00:04:52.490
to know the consequences of this measure

124
00:04:49.76 --> 00:04:54.530
well investment has fallen by 30% since

125
00:04:52.49 --> 00:04:56.360
sakhalin came back to the presidential

126
00:04:54.53 --> 00:04:58.340
palace and of course less investment

127
00:04:56.36 --> 00:05:00.440
means less jobs less growth and

128
00:04:58.34 --> 00:05:02.270
therefore less tax revenue in other

129
00:05:00.44 --> 00:05:05.090
words they decided to eat the cake

130
00:05:02.27 --> 00:05:07.310
before they could even bake it and well

131
00:05:05.09 --> 00:05:09.320
that rarely works that is why there has

132
00:05:07.31 --> 00:05:11.690
been a clear international tendency to

133
00:05:09.32 --> 00:05:14.320
reduce taxation on companies over the

134
00:05:11.69 --> 00:05:14.320
last few years

135
00:05:14.96 --> 00:05:20.300
Canada the UK and Ireland are some

136
00:05:18.35 --> 00:05:22.039
examples of countries where corporate

137
00:05:20.3 --> 00:05:24.320
taxes have been reduced the new

138
00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.949
president of France Emmanuel macron has

139
00:05:24.32 --> 00:05:29.479
also promised to reduce taxes

140
00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.280
well chilly well it's headed in the

141
00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.750
opposite direction but do wait a second

142
00:05:31.28 --> 00:05:34.430
here because well that's not all the

143
00:05:32.75 --> 00:05:37.130
other two main reforms that letters

144
00:05:34.43 --> 00:05:38.990
through have resulted in a very similar

145
00:05:37.13 --> 00:05:40.850
outcome labor reform has made

146
00:05:38.99 --> 00:05:44.090
recruitment more expensive and has given

147
00:05:40.85 --> 00:05:45.590
more power to trade unions some I like

148
00:05:44.09 --> 00:05:47.479
the sound of this but it means more

149
00:05:45.59 --> 00:05:49.430
costs for companies which when added to

150
00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.410
the increase on taxation means there is

151
00:05:49.43 --> 00:05:53.900
even less investments less competition

152
00:05:51.41 --> 00:05:55.460
and less exports essentially all of this

153
00:05:53.9 --> 00:05:57.229
is cause well the whole lot of problems

154
00:05:55.46 --> 00:05:59.030
on the other hand vaca let's tried to

155
00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.919
pass an ambitious reforms u-turn the

156
00:05:59.03 --> 00:06:03.139
private college education system into a

157
00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.970
public free-of-charge service the

158
00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.160
problem is the visual politics via that

159
00:06:04.97 --> 00:06:08.840
this model is very expensive and some

160
00:06:07.16 --> 00:06:10.849
say the solution to the problems of

161
00:06:08.84 --> 00:06:12.889
education is to improve the quality of

162
00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.630
the universities themselves instead of

163
00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.550
making them into factories printing

164
00:06:14.63 --> 00:06:18.380
deployments but anyway the thing is back

165
00:06:16.55 --> 00:06:20.539
and I couldn't pass this reform and in

166
00:06:18.38 --> 00:06:23.060
her attempt to do so she turns the whole

167
00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.500
education system upside down for example

168
00:06:23.06 --> 00:06:26.449
she has reduced the amount of investment

169
00:06:24.5 --> 00:06:28.669
that was plans to improve the quality of

170
00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.320
these universities but ok well now you

171
00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.180
might be wondering well what are the

172
00:06:30.32 --> 00:06:34.990
citizens of Chile think about all of

173
00:06:32.18 --> 00:06:38.300
this well let's look closely

174
00:06:34.99 --> 00:06:40.400
82% of Chileans believe that Michelle

175
00:06:38.3 --> 00:06:42.770
Bachelet government must delay or at

176
00:06:40.4 --> 00:06:44.720
least moderate some of the reforms that

177
00:06:42.77 --> 00:06:47.620
have recently taken place in the country

178
00:06:44.72 --> 00:06:50.080
especially educational reform

179
00:06:47.62 --> 00:06:52.180
if those are the bachelors was working

180
00:06:50.08 --> 00:06:53.650
towards an ideological change rather

181
00:06:52.18 --> 00:06:59.470
than a formula which could actually

182
00:06:53.65 --> 00:07:01.120
solve national problems in fact all

183
00:06:59.47 --> 00:07:02.980
these reforms and the hostility towards

184
00:07:01.12 --> 00:07:05.260
private corporations have led Chile to

185
00:07:02.98 --> 00:07:07.180
suffer the worst economic period for

186
00:07:05.26 --> 00:07:08.620
decades hands wealth you know who is

187
00:07:07.18 --> 00:07:10.930
most negatively affected by the

188
00:07:08.62 --> 00:07:12.730
situation well that's the poor in the

189
00:07:10.93 --> 00:07:15.490
working class after all the wealthy

190
00:07:12.73 --> 00:07:17.550
already have a good standard of living

191
00:07:15.49 --> 00:07:19.720
[Music]

192
00:07:17.55 --> 00:07:21.160
the thing is that alert leaves the

193
00:07:19.72 --> 00:07:22.900
country with a crisis with a growing

194
00:07:21.16 --> 00:07:24.970
public deficit with the highest public

195
00:07:22.9 --> 00:07:27.250
spending of the last 26 years and

196
00:07:24.97 --> 00:07:28.780
frankly with the damaged economy but now

197
00:07:27.25 --> 00:07:30.640
that you know all of this you might be

198
00:07:28.78 --> 00:07:32.650
wondering well besides backcolour one of

199
00:07:30.64 --> 00:07:33.720
the biggest weaknesses in Chile

200
00:07:32.65 --> 00:07:39.830
well let's have a look

00:07:33.72 --> 00:07:43.180
[Music]

202
00:07:39.83 --> 00:07:45.789
Chili's weaknesses

203
00:07:43.18 --> 00:07:47.800
it is a fact that Chile doesn't like

204
00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:49.419
foreign professionals it's a bit strange

205
00:07:47.8 --> 00:07:50.740
for a country like Chile because they

206
00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:52.139
seem to have been incapable of

207
00:07:50.74 --> 00:07:55.000
attracting foreign professionals

208
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:56.259
immigration is only 2 percent and while

209
00:07:55.0 --> 00:07:59.919
that's a problem because it affects

210
00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:02.530
entrepreneurship innovation and prey why

211
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:05.320
won't Chile grow because it is full of

213
00:08:05.32 --> 00:08:08.470
the Center for International Development

214
00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:10.150
of Harvard University

215
00:08:08.47 --> 00:08:12.009
generally speaking foreign professionals

216
00:08:10.15 --> 00:08:16.030
tend to be more entrepreneurial which

217
00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:17.860
helps the economy to diversify and Chile

218
00:08:16.03 --> 00:08:20.169
the rate of entrepreneurship among

219
00:08:17.86 --> 00:08:22.960
immigrants is four times higher than

220
00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:24.520
that among native Chileans the second

221
00:08:22.96 --> 00:08:26.470
problem is that the so called social

222
00:08:24.52 --> 00:08:27.849
ladder is not working that is to say

223
00:08:26.47 --> 00:08:29.530
there are no changes in the social

224
00:08:27.849 --> 00:08:31.509
classes if you're born poor you die poor

225
00:08:29.53 --> 00:08:32.709
if you're born rich you die rich in fact

226
00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:34.330
the country is really controlled by

227
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:37.240
seven families whose wealth is

228
00:08:34.33 --> 00:08:39.789
equivalents to 17% of the national GDP

229
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:41.560
this might seem unimportant but when the

230
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.959
social ladder and competition don't

231
00:08:41.56 --> 00:08:46.480
worked it means the family name is more

232
00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:48.730
important than talent and effort the

233
00:08:46.48 --> 00:08:50.620
opportunity cost for the country is huge

234
00:08:48.73 --> 00:08:52.180
and these families usually have quite

235
00:08:50.62 --> 00:08:53.300
special relationships with power

236
00:08:52.18 --> 00:08:56.790
consider this

Bachelet son was charged with corruption

239
00:08:59.28 --> 00:09:03.960
and gronic Oh Luke sich one of the most

240
00:09:01.98 --> 00:09:05.850
powerful men in Chile and the owner of

241
00:09:03.96 --> 00:09:07.830
the bank of Chile was also involved in

the scandal yes even the battle at name

243
00:09:07.83 --> 00:09:11.580
has been spoiled with corruption and

244
00:09:09.63 --> 00:09:13.320
then there's the bureaucracy I'm sure

245
00:09:11.58 --> 00:09:15.180
you've heard that Chile is a very free

246
00:09:13.32 --> 00:09:17.100
economy well when you take a closer look

247
00:09:15.18 --> 00:09:20.160
you can see it's also very bureaucratic

248
00:09:17.1 --> 00:09:22.080
and it has all kinds of regulations for

249
00:09:20.16 --> 00:09:23.760
instance Chile can't import second-hand

250
00:09:22.08 --> 00:09:25.860
cars and foreign workers don't have

251
00:09:23.76 --> 00:09:27.990
access to a bank account so well it

252
00:09:25.86 --> 00:09:30.150
certainly seems as if it could be more

kinds of lies lies damned lies and

statistics the figures in Chile well

256
00:09:35.01 --> 00:09:40.740
they probably have some of that the next

257
00:09:39.39 --> 00:09:43.770
elections in the country will take place

258
00:09:40.74 --> 00:09:46.020
on the 19th of November 2017 and one

259
00:09:43.77 --> 00:09:48.390
thing is for sure if Chile wants to go

260
00:09:46.02 --> 00:09:50.220
back to the good times they must change

261
00:09:48.39 --> 00:09:51.870
directions so well that's our opinion
