3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,090
Rex it's like a rabbit hole have you

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,320
ever been reading a Wikipedia article

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,120
which leads you to another article and

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,709
then another and another and you know

7
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,719
six hours later you're reading about the

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,789
digestive system of a giraffe wondering

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,530
how you got there what brexit is

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,510
something similar in fact the media has

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,460
been talking about so many details of

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,830
brexit that the very word has become an

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,759
everyday verb saying goodbye to everyone

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,100
at a party and then proceeding to stick

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,289
around the big questions we have are why

16
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,210
is the UK still a part of the European

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,769
Union why have they been arguing for

18
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,140
such a long time and what are they

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,760
arguing about now you might not have

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,440
noticed but London and Brussels have

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,059
been negotiating for more than three

22
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,460
years now and there is still no end in

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,999
sight

24
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,710
even now there is still a possibility

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,030
that the UK might have another

26
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,920
referendum and remain an EU member

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,530
[Music]

28
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,870
so questions for today are well what are

29
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,790
they arguing about why is the UK still

30
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,460
in EU who is to blame for all of this

31
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,860
bracket mess taking so long should we

32
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,990
blame Brussels or London off just nobody

33
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,490
in particular while today we're going to

34
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,800
answer all of these questions but before

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,020
we do let's take a look back at the

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:25,070
history

37
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,670
the impossible deal on the 23rd of June

38
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,020
2016 the United Kingdom called a

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,540
referendum with a clear question should

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,430
the United Kingdom remain a member of

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,409
the European Union or leave the European

42
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,630
Union 51 point eight percent of the

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,670
voters said leave many people think a

44
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,250
1.8 percent difference is not enough to

45
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,229
make such a drastic decision others say

46
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,179
that it's democracy in action but the

47
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,070
truth is from a strictly legal point of

48
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,960
view brexit could be easier than it

49
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,420
looks

50
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,590
[Music]

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,570
to make a comparison the Catalonian

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,000
separatists in Spain pose a real

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,189
challenge to the law why because the

54
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,170
Spanish Constitution does not recognize

55
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,240
the right to self-determination and this

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,009
is why no one knows what to do that

57
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,200
however in this case the UK doesn't have

58
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,090
a constitution so technically speaking

59
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,519
everything is possible as long as

60
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,040
Parliament votes in favor of it and EU

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,290
legislation does recognize the right to

62
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,110
leave the Union there you have it a

63
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,180
member state may decide to withdraw from

64
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,040
the Union in accordance with its own

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,340
constitutional requirements Treaty of

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,920
the European Union article 50 in other

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
words if they had wanted the UK could

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,340
have already left the European Union

69
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,830
they do not need a deal at least from a

70
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,260
legal perspective the problem this would

71
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,930
be an economic disaster with no special

72
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,549
deal the UK would trade with the

73
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,500
European Union under the common rules of

74
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,330
the World Trade Organization this means

75
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,549
a lot of border controls and especially

76
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,400
tariffs many of you might say well so

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,440
what Australia has the same tariffs with

78
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,660
Europe and they're doing pretty well and

79
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,280
well yeah of course they are the thing

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,930
is that Australia and Europe don't

81
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,310
really trade that much with each other

82
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,590
but half of the UK's exports they go to

83
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,989
Europe if we suddenly put tariffs on all

84
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,790
of those products most of the UK

85
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,769
companies would suffer and some would go

86
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,989
bankrupt and the same would happen with

87
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,239
some EU companies but not only that the

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,190
European Union itself would have a hard

89
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,410
time why well mainly because of its

90
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,050
budget

91
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,670
[Music]

92
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,430
you see many EU budgets are not approved

93
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,470
for one specific yet for example the

94
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,690
agricultural budget which is one of the

95
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,060
most important covers six years of

96
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,580
policy this means that in the year 2014

97
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,620
brussels negotiated a budget that will

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,340
last until 2020 back then in 2014 the UK

99
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,739
was a member of the union and also one

100
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,540
of its main contributors if they want to

101
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,970
leave now the EU says while all right

102
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,980
dude I'm okay with you leaving but he

103
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,780
did already commit to paying millions

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,420
and millions of pounds and while I made

105
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,970
my calculations based on that money so

106
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,340
you gotta keep paying this is what we

107
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,110
call the brexit bill that's the amount

108
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,910
of money that the UK must pay in

109
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,750
compensation

110
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,540
[Music]

111
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,000
but make no mistake this has not been

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
the biggest point of disagreements we're

113
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,229
gonna get to that later what you need to

114
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,239
understand now is that both the EU and

115
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,940
the UK want a deal the question is what

116
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,400
kind of deal and here is the problem the

117
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,680
brexit referendum left a very polarized

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,110
British society a country divided

119
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,510
between brexit ears and remain 'as the

120
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,220
first victim of this was the Prime

121
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,110
Minister himself who was just in case

122
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,330
you forgot a man named David Cameron

123
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,789
Cameron organized the referendum but he

124
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:43,070
personally voted to remain and well how

125
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,080
can you successfully negotiate a way out

126
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,030
if you wanted to stay in there was a

127
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,830
clear sign that he had to resign so

128
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,600
instead of calling for elections he made

129
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,460
a primary vote within his own party the

130
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,050
Conservative Party also known as the

131
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,020
Tories and the winner was this one Rhys

132
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,229
amazes brexit means brexit and there

133
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:05,960
will be no attempt to remain inside the

134
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,539
EU and as we always say here on visual

135
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,300
politic as it was said so it was done as

136
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,220
soon as mrs. May put her souls on

137
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,650
Downing Street floor she activated

138
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,960
article 50 London then had two years to

139
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,910
reach a deal with Brussels and leave the

140
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,800
Union at this moment everything was

141
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,229
going as planned but then May wanted to

142
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,180
secure Parliament's support Paul

143
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,949
suggested she could reach a bigger

144
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,039
conservative majority so in June of 2017

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,860
she called for elections and well this

146
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,930
was the results

147
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,960
[Music]

148
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,659
Teresa may losses overall majority in UK

149
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,150
Parliament's yes you had that right

150
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,669
Teresa mais plan completely backfired

151
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,979
she failed so much that in order to be

152
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,780
in the government she had to reach a

153
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,960
deal with a minority party the DUP so

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,789
who are the DUP what are they stand for

155
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,159
well we'll come to that later but for

156
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,080
now just remember their name because

157
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,879
it's very important the thing is with a

158
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,770
less conservative Parliament mrs. Mae

159
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,270
went to Brussels to start the

160
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,189
negotiations a few days later she

161
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:10,199
returned with a deal the EU was happy

162
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,120
with the conditions and Mae was happy

163
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,060
too she just had to get one last thing

164
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,099
Parliament's approval and well what do

165
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,409
you think happens did they pass it well

166
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,620
the result was a historic defeat for Mae

167
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,960
almost nobody voted in favor of her deal

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,150
even half of her own party said no to

169
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,830
her and so now you may be wondering well

170
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,770
why what was so wrong with Mae's plan in

171
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,150
order to understand we must tell you a

172
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,270
story about tomatoes and yes I did say

173
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,219
tomatoes so let's just get into the

174
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,450
story shall we

175
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,050
[Music]

176
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,350

177
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,229
soft breads it's versus hard breaks its

178
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,780
if you thought all tomatoes were created

179
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,310
equal you better think again

180
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,550
we have transgenic tomatoes and

181
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,960
non-transgenic Tomatoes Europe for

182
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,310
better or worse has very strict

183
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,070
regulations against GMOs now we don't

184
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,080
really want to get into the debate of

185
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,960
whether GMOs are good or bad here but

186
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,880
the truth is all EU member countries

187
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,759
have the same anti GMO regulations

188
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,680
thanks to this a Spanish farmer can sell

189
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,479
his tomatoes in Germany Belgium the

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,760
Czech Republic or or every wants without

191
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,530
any problem nobody's afraid that a

192
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,330
Spanish tomorrow is going to be GMO

193
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,840
because nobody in the EU sells GMOs

194
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,840
[Music]

195
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,420
all right so far so good but here is the

196
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,820
political problem Argentina has softer

197
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,980
regulations with regards to GMOs so

198
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,140
let's say Spain wants to make a trade

199
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,480
deal with Argentina so they can buy

200
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,610
tomatoes from them all of a sudden this

201
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,680
Spanish farmer could barley GMOs from

202
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,020
Argentina and that would mean that since

203
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,120
Spain is in the European market this

204
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,430
Spanish farm I could sell GMOs in

205
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,420
Germany Belgium and the Czech Republic

206
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,780
[Music]

207
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,850
as you can imagine the other countries

208
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,250
would not be happy with this this is why

209
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,530
the EU member country means that you are

210
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,660
restricted when making deals with other

211
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,580
countries but hold on a minute because

212
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,050
we're not done yet

213
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,670
there are many European countries that

214
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,800
don't belong to the European Union but

215
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,840
have special deals with Brussels for

216
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,480
example Norway Iceland or Liechtenstein

217
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,090
are not EU members but can sell freely

218
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,310
to Europe Norwegian salmon is sold and

219
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,020
everywhere from France to Poland's to

220
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,640
give you an example so what does this

221
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,710
mean for the Norwegian government well

222
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,479
it means that even though they are out

223
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,630
of the EU they must follow the same

224
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,490
regulations as a member this is the

225
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,320
price they have to pay for having access

226
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,300
to one of these world's biggest markets

227
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,300
and here is where the problem starts for

228
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,400
the UK what may suggest it was very

229
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,680
similar to what Norway has this is what

230
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,910
we call a soft

231
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,160
brexit it basically means well alright

232
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
we don't want to be in the EU anymore

233
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,250
but we're still gonna play by your rules

234
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,680
bracelet is essentially said that is not

235
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,540
happening we voted wrecks it because we

236
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,650
don't want to follow the rules of

237
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,600
Brussels okay all right so what are the

238
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,520
true brexit ears once well they want

239
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,670
what they call a hard brexit

240
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,870
this means that the United Kingdom

241
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,270
doesn't play by Brussels as rules and

242
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,890
therefore they can do trade deals with

243
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,570
whoever they want does this mean that

244
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,310
they wouldn't be able to sell tomatoes

245
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,370
to Europe as easily as they used to well

246
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,590
yes of course they would have to add

247
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,530
lots of customs controls but this is the

248
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,750
price for being really out of the Union

249
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,640
and of course the tomatoes were just an

250
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
example to understand the situation

251
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,810
better a harbour exit would have a lots

252
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,760
of consequences for other products as

253
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,910
you can imagine machines cars food you

254
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,220
name it but the question now is well why

255
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,290
don't they go for a hard break sit then

256
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,680
I mean what's the problem there okay so

257
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,540
you see if the UK was just one island

258
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,520
there'd be no problem at all but the UK

259
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,910
has 136 inhabited island and a problem

260
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,200
can be found on one of them in

261
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
particular Ireland some of you might not

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,860
be aware of this but Northern Ireland is

263
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,320
also part of the UK and Northern Ireland

264
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,480
has a land border with the Republic of

265
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,550
Ireland's which is not a part of the UK

266
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,960
okay so now you might be thinking well

267
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,980
what's the problem with that assignment

268
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,570
can't you just put customs controls at

269
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,470
the Irish border

270
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,450
where's the problem in order to

271
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,370
understand this we're gonna speak a

272
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,050
little bit about the cranberries and

273
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,120
YouTube yeah we're going to talk about

274
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,610
music and it's very very dark history

275
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,920
[Music]

276
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,260
Sunday Bloody Sunday if you like music

277
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,420
or YouTube you surely know one of their

278
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,850
most famous songs Sunday Bloody Sunday

279
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,160
if you don't like you too maybe you like

280
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,440
the cranberries and their greater zombie

281
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,450
what these two songs have in common is

282
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,100
that they both talked about the Northern

283
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,230
Irish conflict also known as the

284
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,510
troubles you see this region had two

285
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,820
opposing paramilitary organizations the

286
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,700
IRA or the Irish Republican Army who

287
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,830
were Catholic and left-wing and they

288
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,960
wanted Northern Ireland to be a part of

289
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,760
the Republic of Ireland's the Ulster

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,830
loyalist paramilitary forces who were

291
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,870
Protestant and a right-wing wanted

292
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,910
Northern Ireland to stay as part of the

293
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,050
UK

294
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,790
we're talking about a conflict that

295
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,220
lasted for more than 30 years and left

296
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,309
more than 3,500 casualties a total

297
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:20,779
bloodbath that affected several

298
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,579
generations if you want to understand

299
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:24,499
the magnitude of this conflict there are

300
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,689
a lot of movies and a lot of songs that

301
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:28,459
portrayed the troubles but this all came

302
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:31,160
to an end in 1998 when the British Prime

303
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,290
Minister Tony Blair reached the famous

304
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,389
Good Friday agreements basically in this

305
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:37,399
deal the two sides of the fight agreed

306
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,230
that Northern Ireland would be British

307
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,269
but the Irish border would remain as a

308
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,459
soft border meaning that everybody could

309
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:45,379
cross it and buy and sell goods without

310
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,610
any problem

311
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,830
now thousands of people cross their

312
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,750
border every single day a heart breaks

313
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,430
it would mean breaking this Good Friday

314
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,440
Agreement and no one wants to do that

315
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,020
because it took decades and a bloodbath

316
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,970
to get there but not only that after the

317
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,590
Good Friday Agreement the violent groups

318
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,660
decided to lay down their arms and turn

319
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,160
their fight into a political battle

320
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,030
since then

321
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,980
IRA supporters went to shin vain and

322
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,110
Ulster loyalists went to the DUP

323
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,180
remember I told you about the DP some

324
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,880
minutes ago well these are those guys

325
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,070
today the DUP is a very conservative

326
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,560
party that opposes gay marriage and has

327
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,960
extreme nationalist feelings towards the

328
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,190
UK

329
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,740
they also have 10 MPs in Parliament who

330
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,720
supported mace government as you can

331
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,819
imagine the deal between May and the DUP

332
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,160
was extremely controversial don't forget

333
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,300
that some of their members had been

334
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,339
linked to a violent group but you know

335
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:41,379
that politics is sometimes complicated

336
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,449
so why do I want to highlight the DUP

337
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,910
particularly

338
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,380
[Music]

339
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,390
Dangerous Liaisons after failing with

340
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,920
the first deal Teresa may return to

341
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,080
Brussels in order to negotiate another

342
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,510
but I let's be honest here her deal was

343
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,730
pretty much still a soft brexit so when

344
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,380
she came back to London the MPs they

345
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,020
said no again and well what did to

346
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,240
reason they do she thought should try

347
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,550
again sure back to Brussels made some

348
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,590
minor changes and came back to London

349
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,720
with pretty much the exact same deal

350
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,060
even her own party were pissed off with

351
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,160
her it looks like she was playing games

352
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,510
and even the Speaker of the House of

353
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,690
Commons took drastic measures John

354
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,570
Bercow rules out third meaningful votes

355
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,670
on same deal basically this is the

356
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,080
British way of saying all right Teresa

357
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,600
may fuck you've tried it once

358
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,120
stop trying this shit again okay by this

359
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,100
time may had to ask Brussels for an

360
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,390
extension because she couldn't get

361
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,040
support in London so in the summer of

362
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,950
2019 she resigned and again the

363
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,390
Conservative Party made primary

364
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,950
elections to choose a brand new prime

365
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,870
minister and the winner was the man you

366
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:57,730
see on screen now getting ready to come

367
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,700
out on October 31st come what may

368
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,660
do-or-die come what may Boris Johnson

369
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,730
prime minister of the UK basically

370
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,830
Johnson's plan was a hard brexit this

371
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,960
means he wanted hard waters with customs

372
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,780
controls and all of that hard stuff all

373
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,700
about Northern Ireland's well he came up

374
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,320
with a very creative solution basically

375
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,940
he wanted to turn it into a special

376
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,100
economic zone so Northern Ireland could

377
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,300
trade with the Republic of Ireland

378
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,520
without any problem just the way they

379
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,050
had done before but trade between

380
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,550
Northern Ireland's and the rest of the

381
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,020
UK would have to pass through some

382
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,720
customs controls in fact this idea could

383
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,250
have been a good boost for the Northern

384
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,839
Irish economy they could have become a

385
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:37,150
sort of brand new Gibraltar Brussels was

386
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,040
really happy with the deal I mean just

387
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,900

388
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,830
beautiful

389
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,310
I have job clothes the boss yeah yeah I

390
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,740

391
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,940
a deal but I'm set about back seat have

392
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,910
a good time yes Johnson's deal was

393
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,220
signed in a friendly mood and good old

394
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,320
Boris thought everyone in London would

395
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,750
clap had done it it finally solved the

396
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,450
brexit puzzle Oh Boris Johnson is so

397
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,640
smart we love you let's go get a beer

398
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,370
except swell no that's not what happens

399
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,290
[Music]

400
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,170
you keep Parliament just blew up Boris

401
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,380
Johnson's breaks at planets yes yes it

402
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,540
seems British politicians are hard to

403
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,210
impress but let's see the bright side of

404
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,430
the story now Johnson was way closer to

405
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,950
reaching a majority than Theresa May to

406
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,870
start with most of the Tories backed his

407
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,290
deal so why did he lose who was the big

408
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,120
surprise here and yes well you

409
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,460
absolutely guessed it it was those 10

410
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,460
MPs from the DUP who turns their back on

411
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,300
Johnson's plan but why

412
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,100
[Music]

413
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,350
why didn't they like it well think about

414
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,870
it the dup are diehard British

415
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,760
nationalists and the idea of Northern

416
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,350
Ireland having a special status which

417
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,060
makes them virtually closer to the

418
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,580
Republic of Ireland sounded like hell to

419
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,560
them and this is when Boris Johnson did

420
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,450
the maths and he said okay so what do I

421
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,710
need to do to get Parliament's approval

422
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,110
on my brexit plan well I just need 16

423
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,680
more Tory MPs just 16 more hmm hey guys

424
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
what does the electoral survey say I

425
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,340
call for a general election could I get

426
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,120
16 extra MPs that I need ah okay good

427
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,010
there's our general election shall we at

428
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,510
the time of making this video we still

429
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,220
don't have the outcomes for this

430
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,830
election but so far survey say that

431
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,990
Boris's bet may be successful

432
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,480
the DUP might not even get seats in

433
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,370
parliament and the Conservatives are

434
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,350
gaining more and more traction but we

435
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,600
also know that surveys are not exactly

436
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,300
accurate so well now the question goes

437
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,460
over to you what outcome do you expect

438
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,560
it do you want as hard a brexit as soon

439
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,270
as possible or would you like the UK to

440
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,160
have a second referendum do you think

441
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,530
Boris Johnson will succeed in his plan

442
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,630
