00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,689
Singapore was nothing more than an

agglomeration of shanties it was a place

they were hard and they weren't very

different at the political level either

19
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,350
the truth is that Singapore's beginnings

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,390
they weren't all that promising see at

several political and ethnic clashes

Malaysian government Singapore was

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,770
expelled from the Malay Federation and

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,259
was de facto forced to declare itself

30
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:13,700
independent and at this point the

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,140
challenge that faced this small

32
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,799
territory was absolutely huge Singapore

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
it was poor it had less than 2 million

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,270

that we all know it's a bit different

later Singapore is an independent

capita income is much higher than the

54
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,920

that of middle-income countries like

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,030

all ask ourselves is well how did this

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,950
tiny city-state achieve such a huge

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,410

folks this entire story it's got one

69
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,230
clear protagonist and that is Lee Kuan

70
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,690
Yew the autocratic Prime Minister who

71
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,870
governed Singapore between 1959 and 1990

know people don't know that I come from

74
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,650
Singapore and they treat me as a Chinese

75
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,050
or as a Chinaman in the old days it used

76
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,910
to call them now few people would have

77
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,380
bet that this country would end up

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,360

the socialist international party this

84
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,069
Prime Minister initially flirted with

85
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:28,870
so-called import substitution

86
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,510
industrialization policies this is a

87
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,549
political approach that blindly commits

88
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,620
to protectionism as a way to achieve

89
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,390
development this was something that was

90
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,040
actually particularly popular throughout

91
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,590
the 20th century in Latin America and is

92
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,370
actually in a way it still is

[Music]

94
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,720
really in his first years of government

95
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,880
Lee Kuan Yew was closer to Argentine

96
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,950
politicians than to anyone who supported

97
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,750
the free market and globalization

98
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,459
however folks unlike what happens in

99
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,230
Latin America in Singapore they soon

100
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,060
realized that this type of policy was by

101
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,520
no means the best way to escape poverty

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,550
[Music]

103
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,739
that's why starting in 1965 a very

104
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,630
different approach was launched a

105
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,220
political and economic commitment that

106
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,650
transformed Singapore completely they

107
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,530
opened up to the global market when most

108
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,330
third world countries denounced the

109
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,680
exploitation of Western multinationals

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,590
in Singapore we invited them that's how

111
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,870
we achieved growth technology and the

112
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,669
know-how that boosted our productivity

113
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,130
more than any other economic policy

114
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,380
could have done Lee Kuan Yew now

115
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,030
Singapore hasn't been anything close to

116
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,740
a prototype of an orthodox and

117
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,570
libertarian state where the government

118
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,130
doesn't interfere in any economic

119
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,440
activity on the contrary the Singaporean

120
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,450
government has played and still plays a

121
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,460
very important role but before we carry

122
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,290
on let's just say that they did it in a

123
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,240
very different way than were used to

124
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,310
for example maths was the case in all

125
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,070
Europe things are changing quickly and

126
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,870
we're having to adjust and keep up due

127
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,210
to technology globalization we've had to

128
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,190
anticipate what's happening we have to

129
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,530
help companies and workers to adapt Lee

130
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,660
Hsien Loong in Singapore the government

131
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,250
didn't try to take over the larger

132
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,870
sections of the economy nor did they

133
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,580
attempt to regulate everything down to

134
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,500
the smallest detail nor of course did

135
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,510
they try to expand public spending and

136
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,610
taxes

137
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,990
quite the opposite in Singapore's case

138
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,419
we can basically think of it as a state

139
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,599
company or better yet a city company you

140
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,199
will know that's right you Stockholm

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,569
that is Lee Kuan Yew understood that

142
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,729
Singapore needed to attract capital and

143
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:37,560
professional so that the country could

144
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,070
grow and develop

145
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,349
[Music]

146
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,629
and with an imperfect competitive

147
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,310
environments between economies and the

148
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,020
heavy intervention that exists in the

149
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,969
countries we live in the state can play

150
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,800
a key role and it can do so with

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,169
policies that always favor

152
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,250
competitiveness investment and the

153
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,990
attraction of companies instead of

154
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,310
bureaucracy and welfare

155
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:07,050
[Music]

156
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,090
that's why the Singaporean authorities

157
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,370
developed institutions to guarantee

158
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,560
legal security and efficient management

159
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
of the city they promoted economic

160
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,770
sectors through public-private

161
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,840
collaboration drew up an ambitious

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,550
productive infrastructure program and

163
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,099
most importantly promoted savings and

164
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,659
that's not all all policies were

165
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,129
designed within a strict budget

166
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:28,620
stability framework and always always

167
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,720
with the mindset of integrating them

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,460
with private agents something that

169
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,590
rarely happens in countries like Spain

170
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,659
or Italy or of course Argentina

171
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:48,190
all right so allow me to explain

172
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,900
it isn't as much about expanding a port

173
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,090
or a road but being able to integrate an

174
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,860
attractive institutional framework with

175
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,660
services that cause companies to settle

176
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,220
in a country they want to encourage

177
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,320
companies to invest so they can increase

178
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
their productivity but let's put it

179
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,380
another way how the companies compete in

180
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,910
the market well they do that by offering

181
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,860
better conditions than the competition

182
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,370
right

183
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,300
[Music]

184
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,030
well Lee Kuan Yew he understood that in

185
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,919
our world competition between countries

186
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,569
is not very different therefore perhaps

187
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,789
the best way to see and understand the

188
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,470
keys to Singapore's success is to view

189
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,090
the city-state and not as a country to

190
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,250
be used but as a service provider in a

191
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,960
competitive industry in Singapore the

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,430
government understood that the community

193
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,949
itself the city itself was an asset and

194
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:34,960
thus well-managed it could become a

195
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,100
competitive advantage

196
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,780
but you understand this better let's

197
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,670
take a look at some concrete examples of

198
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,770
the policies that Lee Kuan Yew set on

199
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,720
the table first objective despite having

200
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,370
a city with a very high population

201
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,440
density turn it into a non chaotic

202
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,290
unknown and unpolluted place to do this

203
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,180
the government imposed traffic taxes in

204
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,700
1975 so today traffic in the city is

205
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,410
subject to tolls that are charged

206
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,660
electronically to all users on the road

207
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,150
that is to vehicles that way they manage

208
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,860
to impute the streets maintenance costs

209
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,900
do the real road users they manage to

210
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,300
avoid traffic jams and stop the build-up

211
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,440
of pollution the results of this

212
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,180
approach has been today's Singapore

213
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,710
despite having a very high population

214
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,720
density and being one of the economic

215
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,760
engines of the world has very fluid

216
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,530
traffic and in addition imposes

217
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,750
maintenance costs based on each drivers

218
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,970
use of the road that is if the benefit

219
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,470
you gain isn't greater than your toll

220
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,000
which is the maintenance cost of the

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,890
road itself then you can leave your car

222
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,630
at home and if the benefit is greater

223
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,400
than you have roads through which you

224
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,500
can move quickly it's really a pretty

225
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,050
smart system

226
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,730
of course to make this all possible

227
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,070
Singapore developed a fantastic very

228
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,900
efficient and affordable public

229
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,150
transportation system

230
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,310
another much more controversial measure

231
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,170
due to its paternalism is forcing all

232
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,790
workers to invest a quarter of their

233
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,980
salary into a rigid national savings

234
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,230
plan that's also managed by a state

235
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,910
organization with this program the

236
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,440
islands government gets workers to

237
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,420
accumulate savings with which they can

238
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,310
pay for health services educational

239
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,170
services and their own retirement and

240
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,670
while that happens the state gets the

241
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,680
capital it needs to invest in projects

242
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,450
in and out of country that are

243
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,310
understood as being essential for the

244
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,230
city's competitiveness in a certain way

245
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,390
workers don't only become users but also

246
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,370
investors in this city company

247
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,630
of course these types of interventions

248
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,220
where the state maintains clear

249
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,350
leadership are complemented by a policy

250
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,970
that favors free enterprise and one of

251
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,400
the freest regulations in the world in

252
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,410
terms of capital goods and worker

253
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,720
circulation folks in Singapore taxes are

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,090
low for example someone with a $60,000

255
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,820
income pays just 5% income tax tariffs

256
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,500
are practically non-existent there's no

257
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,540
minimum wage public expenditure accounts

258
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,730
for approximately 18 percent of the GDP

259
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,050
and if all that weren't enough

260
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,790
Singapore's economy is considered to be

261
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,780
the second freest in the world see in

262
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,340
the world we live in today being

263
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,530
peripheral or being central doesn't

264
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,820
depend on your country's physical

265
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,470
location it depends on whether or not

266
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,720
you have a room and an economy of

267
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,150
knowledge it depends on technology it's

268
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,860
the only thing that can explain what

269
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,660
countries like Singapore have a much

270
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,940
better education system than we do

271
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,870
Albert Riviera MP of Spain

272
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,220
the result of all this is that a country

273
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,319
that until a few decades ago is very

274
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,959
poor is now one of the richest countries

275
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,850
in the world and don't think that it's

276
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,709
just a matter of economics Singapore

277
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,809
also has some of the best universities

278
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,490
with students at the forefront of

279
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,290
subjects like science and mathematics

280
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,819
further their healthcare system is

281
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,259
excellent there's basically no

282
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,819
employment or crime ins their

283
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:45,379
expectations for the future are

284
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:50,240
extraordinary for example in the Human

285
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,800
Development Index produced by the United

286
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,050
Nations Singapore currently occupies the

287
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,149
tenth place above countries like Sweden

288
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,130
Iceland France and Finland

289
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,779
the negative side and there is one is

290
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,430
concentrated in its political system

291
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,410
which although it's still evolving is

292
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,540
still very restrictive of civil

293
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,580
liberties in Singapore prison sentences

294
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,440
a very high censorship is a normal part

295
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,029
of life and different behaviors to the

296
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,410
Norma usually not well regarded we're

297
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,700
going to talk about all of this more in

298
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,230
future videos because Singapore is one

299
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,120
of the most fascinating countries in the

300
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,649
world and it's a real magnet for

301
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,300
professionals from all over the globe so

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,740
I really hope you enjoyed that video and

but seriously they are very good-looking

316
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,370
templates or if you hate beautiful

317
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,410
templates not judging here you can start

deal with because no one likes any of

330
