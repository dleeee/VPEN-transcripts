00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,210
affordable when compared to pricey

30
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,580
in-person classes and workshops I've

31
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,229
been to some of those it always feels

32
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,330
like it's just too much an annual

33
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,159

month with Skillshare so support visual

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,090
politic by supporting skill share that

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,799
would be wonderful there is a link below

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,350
to that two-month trial let's get into

38
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,710
it

39
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,990
in recent decades Donald Trump stands

40
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,850
out as the president's who's been the

41
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,040
most hostile in his attitudes towards

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,780
Hispanics perhaps eases even though it's

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,820
hostile in the entire history of the

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,650
United States his comments against

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,810
immigration Mexican Salvadorians you

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,310
don't have to look very far to

47
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,049
understand why a good part of the

48
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,060
Hispanic population can't stand

49
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,070
President Trump they're bringing drugs

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,460
they're bringing crime they're rapists

51
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,740
and some I assume are good people

52
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,500
African Americans Hispanics are living

53
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,899
in hell because it's so dangerous you

54
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,759
walk down the street you get shot but

55
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,990
don't get me wrong here on visual

56
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,759
politic we're all for people changing

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
their minds and their behavior I mean

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,240
come on I'm sure that ten years ago you

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,310
didn't have the same views as you do

60
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,590
today is certainly true for me after all

61
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,239
self correction there's a sign of wisdom

62
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,800
and you know what it may come as a

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,560
surprise but this is what Trump is doing

64
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,750
in his own kind of weird way don't

65
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,310
believe me what he really is

66
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,709
check this out I love immigrants I love

67
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:21,450
immigrants this country is based on

68
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,860
immigrants it's quite the change

69
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,090
wouldn't you agree

70
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,220
so the question is what on earth happens

71
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,200
well no Trumpton undergo a deep

72
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,630
spiritual transformation or was he

73
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,730
suddenly moved to empathize with the

74
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,130
Hispanic communities situation and no

75
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,780
it's not even because he's a fan of

76
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Jennifer Lopez's last hit do you want to

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,760
know what really lies behind this game

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,190
change well listen up

79
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,320

81
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,690
the Hispanic vote remember these three

82
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,460
words because they may be key in the

83
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,510
2020 US elections

84
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,040
[Music]

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,960
to give you an idea Hispanics already

86
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,390
accounts for 18% of the entire US

87
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,670
population and this percentage keeps on

88
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,970
growing

89
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,290
[Music]

90
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,450
Hispanics are already the largest

91
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,040
minority group in the country

92
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,209
[Music]

93
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:35,129
according to every projection and

94
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,709
demographic model by 2060 the percentage

95
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,319
of Hispanics will exceed 26% of the

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,300
population of the United States

97
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,670
in other words just over one in four

98
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,770
Americans will be Hispanic obviously

99
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,390
this will give them make gradually

100
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,000
increasing electoral influence so making

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
policy is or giving speeches against

102
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,170
Hispanics doesn't look like a great way

103
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,110
to reap oolitic all success it all seems

104
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,710
pretty obvious doesn't it however hold

105
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,330
on a second because nowadays the

106
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,920
electoral weight of the Hispanic

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,260
community is much much weaker than it

108
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,610
could be

109
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,769
[Music]

110
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,410
and why is that well that's because if

111
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,699
there is something that characterizes

112
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,250
the Hispanic vote in the United States

113
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,670
it's that it is very hard to mobilize

114
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,660
[Music]

115
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,770
Hispanics are known for that low voter

116
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,530
turnout in u.s. elections that's really

117
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,630
bad

118
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,160
but why does this happen what exactly is

119
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,410
the Spanish electorate what concerns do

120
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,199
they have and how is the Hispanic vote

121
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,280
distributed throughout the country it

122
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,930
sounds like a lot of questions but I

123
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,520
promise you we're going to answer each

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,310
and every one of them in this video and

125
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:07,139
here we go Hispanics the major minority

126
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,460
if we take a look at the main ethnic

127
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,199
groups in the United States will notice

128
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,270
that the Hispanic population has some

129
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,310
peculiar characteristics and as we've

130
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,139
said we aren't exactly talking about a

131
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,060
small community almost 60 million

132
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,220
Hispanics lived in the u.s. by the end

133
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,030
of 2018

134
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,919
this makes the United States the second

135
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,750
largest Hispanic country in terms of

136
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,860
population

138
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,170
where it seems hard to believe the

139
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,030
United States has more Hispanic people

140
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,070
than the entire populations of countries

141
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,960

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,440
States grows in demographic terms at a

145
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,300
rate of 2% per year and in recent

146
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,980
decades their standard of living has

147
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,790
also improved a lot to give you an idea

148
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,650
the current rate of unemployment for

149
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,900
Hispanics is close to its historical low

150
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,800
below 5% the dropout rate decreased from

151
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,130
29.4% in 1991 and 9.2 percent in 2015

152
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,840
and the rate of Hispanics enrolled in

153
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,600
universities rose from 25 percent to 47

154
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,390
percent in just 10 years between 2005

155

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,630
these are very good numbers and these

158
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,640
changes guarantee Hispanics a much

159
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,350
greater economic political and social

160
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:37,150
influence in the years to come

161
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,100
to illustrate this just since 2000

162
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,200
Hispanics purchasing power in the US has

163
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,580

percent rising to 1.4 trillion dollars

165
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,430
this means that the United States is the

166
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,530
largest Hispanic economic power in the

167
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,750
world the Hispanic economy in the United

168
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,030
States is larger than the entire economy

169
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,640
of Spain or Mexico Hispanic power is

170
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,800
only going to increase in the United

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,170
States however it's not all good news if

172
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,760
we talk in terms of income and poverty

173
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,170
the truth is that the Hispanic

174
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,360
population is still far behind the white

175
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,370

176
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,530

in five are still below the poverty line

180
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,940
according to u.s. standards and the

181
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,650
average income per capita doesn't

182
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,590
surpass $19,000 per year which is half

186
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,290
to politics which is really what this

187
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,669

188
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:40,070
population is very young their average

189
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,350
age is 10 years lower than the national

190
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,360
average and 15 years lower than the

191
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,190
average age of the white population in

192
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,290
the u.s. these demographics obviously

193
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,000
influence the community's political

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,590
preferences and their degree of

195
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:58,160
participation it may also explain why

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,350
while Hispanics already account for 18

197
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,970
percent of the country's population in

198
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,919
terms of potential voters a barely

199
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,169
account for 11 percent and on top of

200
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:08,060
that they vote less frequently that's

201
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,070
why their political influence is still

202
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,650
relatively small but this is also

203
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,499
changing

204
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,729
the dysfunction of the Hispanic vote

205
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,779
first look at the map the distribution

206
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,759
of the Hispanic population might

207
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,529
indicate that they are a determining

208
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:31,430
community when it comes to the elections

209
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,279
[Music]

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,539
because as you know in the u.s.

211
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,490
elections the presidential candidate who

212
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,620
obtains the majority in a state gets all

213
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,810
of that states delegates that happens in

214
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,699
virtually every case it's an

215
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:45,829
all-or-nothing situation that's why the

216
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,779
presidential victory depends on getting

217
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,790
more delegates than the opponent not

218
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,740
more votes and that makes the states

219
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,660
with the most delegates seats the prize

220
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,220
that all presidential candidates desire

221
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,980
[Music]

222
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,140
well it turns out that Hispanics have a

223
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,660
very high presence in those price States

224
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,310
Hispanic population is mostly

225
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,530
concentrated in California Texas New

226
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,990
York Florida and Illinois five of these

227
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,610
six states with the most delegates

228
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,730
distributed in the elections that's 171

229
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,670
out of a total of 538 delegates so you

230
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,680
can probably see why first glance they

231
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,200
seem so crucial to the elections

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,600
[Music]

233
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,820
yeah they are but they're also not so

234
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,410
let's see many analysts claim that the

235
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,540
Hispanic vote can decide presidents but

236
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,880
the truth is it isn't so clear today at

237
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,190
least not for the 2020 elections so

238
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,690
what's the problem well that's what

239
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,490
we've already told you Hispanics don't

240
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,850
really vote among all ethnic groups

241
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,279
Hispanics are the least electoral

242
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,029
immobilised

243
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,680
for example in the last presidential

244
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,100
elections in 2016 just over 57% of

245
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,390
Hispanics with the right to vote

246
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,459
actually registered to do so now that's

247
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,470
a low number but what's even worse is

248
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,360
that in the end only forty seven point

249
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,670
six percent actually voted that's almost

250
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,350
20 points less than the political

251
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,060
participation of non-hispanic white

252
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:23,300
people so why is it that Hispanics avoid

253
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,190
elections so much well there are many

254
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,230
factors but the most important one is

255
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,390
that it's mostly a young population and

256
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,800
well what can I say outside the visual

257
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,149
politic community it seems like a many

258
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,950
young people tend to just skip over

259
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:40,700
politics but that's not the only reason

260
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,920
the lower average level of education and

261
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,380
income also feeds political apathy at

262
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,700
this point any of you are probably

263
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,260
already thinking well come on I mean

264
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,850
this is normal it happens in a lot of

265
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,410
countries well yes

266
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,300
but also no weird to tell you this

267
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,010
little by little this divergence

268
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,630
regarding the non-hispanic white

269
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,690
population is lower

270
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,850
Hispanics are studying more making more

271
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,770
money and voting for example look what

272
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,600
happens in most recent elections the

273
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,710
midterm elections Latino turn up-up 174

274
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,050
percent in 2018 midterm elections

275
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,210
Democrats say and of course you might be

276
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,340
thinking if the problem of mobilizing

277
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,230
the Hispanic community is being solved

278
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,170
that they'd be really decisive in 2020

279
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,140
well let's see

280
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:30,630
[Music]

281
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,450
could hispanics decide the 2020 election

282
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,280
do you have good memories remember

283
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,930
Trump's words which we saw at the

284
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,790
beginning of this video no I'm not

285
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,990
referring to the ones in which he

286
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,030
insults Hispanics but the latex in which

287
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:51,950
she suddenly seems to love them will

288
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,150
that change your opinion could have a

289
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,860
lot to do with what we're going to see

290
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,750
next

291
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,310
Hispanics can make a difference in 2020

292
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,050
if they turn out to vote an important

293
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,940
facts for 2020 elections will be the

294
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,500
first elections in the history of the

295
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,390
United States in which Hispanics will be

296
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,520
the minority with the most electoral

297
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,770
power surpassing the african-american

298
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,290
population

299
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,020
[Music]

300
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,630
yeah with 32 million potential voters by

301
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,150
2020 Hispanics will account for 13% of

302
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,770
the electoral roll there will be 2

303
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,330
million more of them than African

304
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,220
American voters and nowadays spanning

305
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,290
dynamics are quite clear 2 out of every

306
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,870
3 usually vote for Democratic Party

307
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,670
candidates but the explanation for this

308
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,870
isn't that they're Democrats or

309
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,600
Republicans it lies in the systemic

310
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,280
opposition that the Republican Party has

311
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,580
had to them in recent years

312
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,769
yes despite what is commonly believed

313
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,050
the Hispanic vote is extremely volatile

314
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,060
indeed perhaps the most volatile most

315
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,920
don't identify themselves as dedicated

316
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,380
supporters of one particular party but

317
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,420
rather oscillate based on the candidates

318
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,070
and the political proposals that they

319
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,690
have on the table and the Trump campaign

320
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,980
is well aware of that

321
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,110
you see all studies suggest that the

322
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,970
economy along with the improvement of

323
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,710
education and safety are the three

324
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,870
issues that Hispanic voters can most

325
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,310
about and the truth is that the US

326
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,530
economy has been performing quite well

327
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,020
in recent years for example the income

328
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,240
of Hispanic households is the fastest

329
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,070
growing and also remember that Hispanic

330
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,500
unemployment is at a record low in fact

331
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,240
even though it's still low at just 30

332
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,890
percent scrums popularity among

333
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:34,330
Hispanics has slightly rebounded it may

334
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,590
come as a surprise a trump campaign

335
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,570
hasn't given up on the attempt to

336
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,460
improve their support level among the

337
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,650
Hispanic community the vamos to victory

338
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,320
campaign is a good example of that more

339
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,270
Hispanics think that Trump's campaign

340
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,430
have the community in mind but those who

341
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,780
say they will vote for him are a

342
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,910
minority and the question is could this

343
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,680
be Trump's last card

344
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,840
[Music]

345
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,110
a demobilized hispanic vote would

346
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,970
definitely benefit him but what if they

347
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,800
were to mobilize wouldn't it be more

348
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,020
sensible to reinforce his position in

349
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,760
that new voting grounds or at the very

350
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,040
least stop giving hispanics reasons to

351
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,630
mobilize against him the truth is that

352
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,550
everything indicates that in 2020

353
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,710
Hispanics are going to vote more their

354
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,270
participation is set to break all

355
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,460
records for a presidential election just

356
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,250
as it did in the midterms Hispanic voter

357
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,770
turnout in 2018 increased dramatically

358
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,380
in six states analysis finds Hispanic

359
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,360
voter turnout increased significantly in

360
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,460
the 2018 midterms as compared to the

361
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,710
2014 election according to University on

362
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,330
analysis of turnout in California

363
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,880
Florida Nevada New Jersey New York and

364
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,980
Texas some of those states sound

365
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,779
familiar to you exactly you got it out

366
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,370
of the five states where Hispanic vote

367
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,350
increased the most no less than for

368
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,450
California Florida New York and Texas

369
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,250
are among the ones with the most

370
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,860
delegates

371
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,600
in other words they are the most

372
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,520
important regarding presidential

373
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,230
elections so having seen this well

374
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,030
they're spanic community be the deciding

375
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,370
factor this time well Trump managed to

376
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,680
improve his popularity among Hispanics

377
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,510
because in spite of everything if the

378
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,940
economy continues to do well it's not

379
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,280
entirely unlikely however the trade war

380
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,470
with China is having harsh consequences

381
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,780
for the US and economic slowdown is a

382
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,150
reality if 2020 gets worse it may even

383
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,070
be Hispanics who end up throwing trump

384
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,600
out of the white house that would be

385
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,730
rather ironic wouldn't you think anyway

386
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,780
now it's your turn

387
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,240
will Trump get reelected by seducing the

388
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,340
Hispanic vote or are we on the verge of

389
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,440
an epic revenge so I really hope you
