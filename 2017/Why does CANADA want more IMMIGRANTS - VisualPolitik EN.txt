3
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.639
we have to be clear the world has never

4
00:00:08.94 --> 00:00:13.650
been better than it is right now thanks

5
00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.139
mostly to globalization there are less

6
00:00:13.65 --> 00:00:18.000
and less Wars global poverty is falling

7
00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.020
markedly and quality of life is

8
00:00:18.0 --> 00:00:24.060
generally improving this is obviously

9
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:26.099
not happening in a uniform way across

10
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:28.019
all countries Berdych globally

11
00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.090
everything is improving many Western

12
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.250
countries have decided to rebel and

13
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:34.680
refuse opener as well as understanding

14
00:00:32.25 --> 00:00:36.750
among their nations in Europe for

15
00:00:34.68 --> 00:00:39.030
example far-right parties are spreading

16
00:00:36.75 --> 00:00:40.649
uncertainty those lepen in France that

17
00:00:39.03 --> 00:00:45.570
vials of in the Netherlands where's

18
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.610
offer in Austria these are all good

19
00:00:45.57 --> 00:00:49.680
examples of a new wave of politics that

20
00:00:47.61 --> 00:00:52.079
is also affecting countries like Finland

21
00:00:49.68 --> 00:00:53.610
Denmark Germany and Hungary among others

22
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.039
further it is also partly responsible

23
00:00:53.61 --> 00:00:57.600
for the brexit victory in the United

24
00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.180
Kingdom

25
00:00:57.6 --> 00:01:04.680
[Music]

26
00:01:02.18 --> 00:01:06.869
it is a movement that is taking

27
00:01:04.68 --> 00:01:08.580
advantage of fear despite the fact that

28
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.710
we are living in societies that are

29
00:01:08.58 --> 00:01:12.360
becoming safer and safer but as you well

30
00:01:10.71 --> 00:01:14.369
know these ideas are not something that

31
00:01:12.36 --> 00:01:16.530
is exclusive to Europe Donald Trump won

32
00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.780
the US election and he has spoken about

33
00:01:16.53 --> 00:01:21.090
his views which are clearly contrary to

34
00:01:18.78 --> 00:01:23.490
globalization and immigration at this

35
00:01:21.09 --> 00:01:25.740
point the best question we can ask is

36
00:01:23.49 --> 00:01:28.470
are there any developed countries left

37
00:01:25.74 --> 00:01:30.540
that still believe in open borders and

38
00:01:28.47 --> 00:01:33.060
the globalization well the answer to

39
00:01:30.54 --> 00:01:34.320
that question is yes there are and in

40
00:01:33.06 --> 00:01:36.420
the video today we're going to be

41
00:01:34.32 --> 00:01:41.509
looking at one of the most significant

42
00:01:36.42 --> 00:01:45.750
of those countries cannabis open this

43
00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.660
new year 2016 alone Canada admitted to

44
00:01:45.75 --> 00:01:50.640
its country more than three hundred

45
00:01:47.66 --> 00:01:52.979
thousand immigrants that is close to one

46
00:01:50.64 --> 00:01:55.229
percent of Canada's total population

47
00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.360
further this is a greater portion than

48
00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.770
any other developed country and do note

49
00:01:57.36 --> 00:02:00.210
is that this is nothing new this is

50
00:01:58.77 --> 00:02:02.700
something that's been going on for two

51
00:02:00.21 --> 00:02:05.340
decades the result of this is that today

52
00:02:02.7 --> 00:02:07.410
one in every five Canadians was born

53
00:02:05.34 --> 00:02:10.229
abroad this is a percentage that has

54
00:02:07.41 --> 00:02:13.830
almost double that of the US and the UK

55
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.290
[Music]

56
00:02:13.83 --> 00:02:18.930
and the fact of the matter is is that

57
00:02:16.29 --> 00:02:21.120
this haven't led to any sort of national

58
00:02:18.93 --> 00:02:23.580
tragedy in fact quite the opposite and

59
00:02:21.12 --> 00:02:25.770
Canadians well loaded according to the

60
00:02:23.58 --> 00:02:28.500
prestigious and veronik Institute's most

61
00:02:25.77 --> 00:02:30.390
citizens almost 80% of them consider

62
00:02:28.5 --> 00:02:32.160
immigration to be good for the economy

63
00:02:30.39 --> 00:02:33.930
and think that it is one of the best

64
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:35.850
ways to deal with some of the issues

65
00:02:33.93 --> 00:02:45.270
facing Canada such as its aging

66
00:02:35.85 --> 00:02:47.940
population if you really think about it

67
00:02:45.27 --> 00:02:50.220
it does make sense employment is the

68
00:02:47.94 --> 00:02:51.390
country's most productive asset so why

69
00:02:50.22 --> 00:02:53.580
would they want to prevent it from

70
00:02:51.39 --> 00:02:55.200
growing in the context of a dynamic

71
00:02:53.58 --> 00:02:56.670
economy what's the harm of immigrants

72
00:02:55.2 --> 00:02:58.500
who are willing to work who are willing

73
00:02:56.67 --> 00:03:00.300
to set up companies and want to get an

74
00:02:58.5 --> 00:03:02.160
education it is something that we a

75
00:03:00.3 --> 00:03:09.990
visual politic think is actually pretty

76
00:03:02.16 --> 00:03:12.180
good with our first year in 2015

77
00:03:09.99 --> 00:03:14.400
Justin Trudeau became Canada's prime

78
00:03:12.18 --> 00:03:16.650
minister he defeated against all odds

79
00:03:14.4 --> 00:03:18.300
the conservative Stephen Harper Harper

80
00:03:16.65 --> 00:03:20.430
Hurd held the office for almost 10 years

81
00:03:18.3 --> 00:03:23.130
since then the political agenda has been

82
00:03:20.43 --> 00:03:25.680
dominated by a determination to deepen

83
00:03:23.13 --> 00:03:27.959
the country's pro globalization policies

84
00:03:25.68 --> 00:03:29.550
Trudeau himself a left winger has been

85
00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.739
quite an advocate of promoting free

86
00:03:29.55 --> 00:03:33.120
trade and social mobility in his first

87
00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.459
year he signed a free trade agreement

88
00:03:33.12 --> 00:03:37.620
with the European Union and confirmed

89
00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.420
Canada's adherence to the TPP although

90
00:03:37.62 --> 00:03:41.550
Trump's first action in office was to

91
00:03:39.42 --> 00:03:43.590
destroy the TPP we're going to be the

92
00:03:41.55 --> 00:03:45.630
biggest commercial agreement in history

93
00:03:43.59 --> 00:03:47.670
in just a year Canada has built up free

94
00:03:45.63 --> 00:03:49.950
trade agreements with nearly 60 percent

95
00:03:47.67 --> 00:03:52.050
of the global economy further Trudeau

96
00:03:49.95 --> 00:03:53.840
wants to expand this and increase trade

97
00:03:52.05 --> 00:03:56.700
with China we've agreed to launch

98
00:03:53.84 --> 00:03:58.950
exploratory talks towards a potential

99
00:03:56.7 --> 00:04:01.470
free trade agreement between Canada and

100
00:03:58.95 --> 00:04:03.390
China and the government is doing more

101
00:04:01.47 --> 00:04:04.800
of the same concerning immigration

102
00:04:03.39 --> 00:04:07.080
they've even set the goal of increasing

103
00:04:04.8 --> 00:04:10.170
the number of immigrants they get by 50%

104
00:04:07.08 --> 00:04:11.790
every single year from a refugee fleeing

105
00:04:10.17 --> 00:04:14.550
somalia to becoming a member of

106
00:04:11.79 --> 00:04:16.260
parliament in canada Amazonas once again

107
00:04:14.55 --> 00:04:17.730
amid history of this week after he was

108
00:04:16.26 --> 00:04:19.680
named the Canada's Minister of

109
00:04:17.73 --> 00:04:21.780
immigrations by Prime Minister Justin

110
00:04:19.68 --> 00:04:23.490
Trudeau in a major cabinet reshuffle

111
00:04:21.78 --> 00:04:24.510
given these principles it probably

112
00:04:23.49 --> 00:04:25.950
shouldn't surprise you to learn that

113
00:04:24.51 --> 00:04:26.750
Canada is one of the countries that are

114
00:04:25.95 --> 00:04:29.180
most committed

115
00:04:26.75 --> 00:04:31.880
receiving Syrian refugees Canada has

116
00:04:29.18 --> 00:04:34.070
received more than 33,000 Syrian

117
00:04:31.88 --> 00:04:36.110
refugees since Trudeau took office in

118
00:04:34.07 --> 00:04:37.910
his first year Trudeau himself went in

119
00:04:36.11 --> 00:04:46.730
Toronto's airports to welcome the

120
00:04:37.91 --> 00:04:49.610
refugees into the country I create

121
00:04:46.73 --> 00:04:52.070
infallibly but hold on a second because

122
00:04:49.61 --> 00:04:54.020
immigration to Canada isn't totally free

123
00:04:52.07 --> 00:04:55.550
in fact it's not as free as we're visual

124
00:04:54.02 --> 00:04:57.500
politic would like but what's really

125
00:04:55.55 --> 00:04:58.960
important here is not whether or whether

126
00:04:57.5 --> 00:05:01.280
there are not excessive administrative

127
00:04:58.96 --> 00:05:03.260
difficulties but rather that citizens

128
00:05:01.28 --> 00:05:04.700
shouldn't automatically view those who

129
00:05:03.26 --> 00:05:07.130
are immigrating to the country as

130
00:05:04.7 --> 00:05:09.440
criminals and this is precisely why

131
00:05:07.13 --> 00:05:11.630
Canada is so successful they are a

132
00:05:09.44 --> 00:05:13.490
country that takes pride in looking for

133
00:05:11.63 --> 00:05:16.100
additional citizens they are not looking

134
00:05:13.49 --> 00:05:18.140
for temporary immigrants since 1967

135
00:05:16.1 --> 00:05:20.690
immigration to Canada has been based on

136
00:05:18.14 --> 00:05:22.970
a point system this system considers

137
00:05:20.69 --> 00:05:24.230
qualification experience professional

138
00:05:22.97 --> 00:05:26.390
skills and the knowledge of either

139
00:05:24.23 --> 00:05:28.520
French or English in the same way the

140
00:05:26.39 --> 00:05:30.770
system also gives priority to those who

141
00:05:28.52 --> 00:05:33.530
are needed by Canada's companies Canada

142
00:05:30.77 --> 00:05:35.840
will lift the Mexican visa requirement

143
00:05:33.53 --> 00:05:37.820
that has restricted travel to Canada

144
00:05:35.84 --> 00:05:40.220
this move will make it easier for our

145
00:05:37.82 --> 00:05:42.160
Mexican friends to visit Canada while

146
00:05:40.22 --> 00:05:44.750
growing our local economies and

147
00:05:42.16 --> 00:05:46.280
strengthening our communities the

148
00:05:44.75 --> 00:05:48.710
tendency seems to be to make these

149
00:05:46.28 --> 00:05:50.900
procedures easier but what is really

150
00:05:48.71 --> 00:05:53.180
important is the social recognition and

151
00:05:50.9 --> 00:05:53.720
the integration of immigrants into the

152
00:05:53.18 --> 00:05:55.370
country

153
00:05:53.72 --> 00:05:57.710
the Canadian Bill of Rights itself

154
00:05:55.37 --> 00:05:58.400
recognizes the concept of multicultural

155
00:05:57.71 --> 00:05:59.960
patrimony

156
00:05:58.4 --> 00:06:02.300
there are followed policies to encourage

157
00:05:59.96 --> 00:06:04.160
integration which by the way don't focus

158
00:06:02.3 --> 00:06:06.020
on stripping the immigrants of their

159
00:06:04.16 --> 00:06:08.690
original cultural identities but rather

160
00:06:06.02 --> 00:06:11.839
see that as an enriching factor

161
00:06:08.69 --> 00:06:11.839
[Music]

162
00:06:13.87 --> 00:06:17.770
for example in Canadian schools it is

163
00:06:15.88 --> 00:06:20.230
easy to find classes that are taught in

164
00:06:17.77 --> 00:06:22.720
Spanish or Ukrainian and the results

165
00:06:20.23 --> 00:06:23.470
support these policies indeed in the

166
00:06:22.72 --> 00:06:25.240
last decade

167
00:06:23.47 --> 00:06:27.820
Canada's growth has been bigger than the

168
00:06:25.24 --> 00:06:30.310
u.s. the UK and Germany and its citizens

169
00:06:27.82 --> 00:06:31.990
enjoy a very high standard of living now

170
00:06:30.31 --> 00:06:33.520
hopefully it might be more clear as to

171
00:06:31.99 --> 00:06:37.810
why Canada's immigration website

172
00:06:33.52 --> 00:06:39.400
collapsed after Trump's victory the also

173
00:06:37.81 --> 00:06:41.440
might understand why the Economist has

174
00:06:39.4 --> 00:06:44.340
also had cover pages highlighting

175
00:06:41.44 --> 00:06:44.340
Canada's living

176
00:06:45.91 --> 00:06:50.170
now of course the Canadian model is not

177
00:06:48.4 --> 00:06:52.240
perfect but compared to the new

178
00:06:50.17 --> 00:06:54.430
nationalist and populist tendencies of

179
00:06:52.24 --> 00:06:56.740
other countries Canada has shown what a

180
00:06:54.43 --> 00:06:58.810
desirable alternative openness can

181
00:06:56.74 --> 00:07:01.030
really be looking takeaway that we hope

182
00:06:58.81 --> 00:07:02.620
this video really puts across is to try

183
00:07:01.03 --> 00:07:04.570
and make things better in your country

184
00:07:02.62 --> 00:07:06.100
rather than isolate it from the rest of

185
00:07:04.57 --> 00:07:07.690
the world the latter of which is an

186
00:07:06.1 --> 00:07:09.430
argument that many politicians like

187
00:07:07.69 --> 00:07:11.080
Trump are defending well this is our

188
00:07:09.43 --> 00:07:13.420
opinion here at visual politics and now

189
00:07:11.08 --> 00:07:15.460
we would love to know yours do you think

190
00:07:13.42 --> 00:07:17.470
immigration causes as many problems as

191
00:07:15.46 --> 00:07:19.540
people claim we can like to live in a

192
00:07:17.47 --> 00:07:21.610
culturally diverse country like Canada
