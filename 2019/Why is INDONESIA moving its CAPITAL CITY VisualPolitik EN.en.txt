3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,410
Indonesia is a country famous for having

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,020
a headbanger as a president I'm sure

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,610
other presidents of other countries love

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,619
heavy metal too but nobody shows his

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,500
love for this genre as much as Joko

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,050
Widodo even Judas Priest invited him

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,970
publicly to one of their concerts but

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,040
make no mistake despite being a Judas

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,039
Priest fan mr. Widodo aka jokowi

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,530
is not a big fan of breaking the law

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:36,280
just check out this news

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,949
Indonesian president pays $800 from

15
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:42,140
Metallica gift the important thing here

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,750
is not Widodo slow for Metallica Reds

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,879
the fact that he has paid $800 from his

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,100
own pocket to keep a gift you see when

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,690
you are the presidents of a country it's

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,610
common to personally receive foreign

21
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,500
dignitaries and celebrities in such

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,510
cases the etiquette says that visitors

23
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,549
should give a symbolic present to the

24
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:01,129
leader artworks antiquities or in this

25
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,019
case a rare edition of Metallica's

26
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,879
Master of Puppets album as you can

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,410
imagine these kinds of persons can

28
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,220
generate conflicts of interest

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,740
that's why in most countries it's

30
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,720
illegal for the official to accept such

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,670
gifts usually they become part of the

32
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,110
states heritage and they can be

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,180
exhibited in national museums and things

34
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,710
like that but in this case we don't

35
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,510
really want it to have this Metallica

36
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,340
record being the president's he could

37
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,780
have broken the law and taken it for

38
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,729
free in a country like Indonesia this

39
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:32,860
wouldn't even make the liquid news but

40
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,170
he decided to do the right thing and pay

41
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,640
a fee to an Indonesian

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,590
anti-corruption Bureau in order to keep

43
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,900
us and really something like this it was

44
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,940
kind of unique for Indonesia we're

45
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,830
talking about the birthplace of the most

46
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,960
corrupt politicians in history and I'm

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,910
not exaggerating literally the most

48
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,680
corrupt man in history according to

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,020
Transparency International was one of

50
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,090
Indonesia's former presidents this

51
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,850
explains why in April 2000 and 1980 five

52
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,070
million Indonesians voted to reelect

53
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,259
Joko Widodo for another term he's

54
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,300
revolutionized the country for good and

55
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,560
we're not talking about a small country

56
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,880
here it is the most populated

57
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,830
muslim-majority country in the world

58
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,160
with a population above 255 million but

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,360
by far is one of his greatest objectives

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,760
welcome to the jungle Indonesia pics

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,280
site for new capital city

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,050
yes Indonesia has announced that they

63
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,360
will move their capital by 2024

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,370
you don't hear news like this every week

65
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,990
of course it's not the first time

66
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,460
something like this has happened

67
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,950
Brazil Nigeria and Kazakhstan have also

68
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,600
changed their capitals just to name a

69
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,580
few however the case of Indonesia has a

70
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,530
very interesting story behind it if

71
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,150
you've been following visual politic for

72
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,740
a long time you might remember this

73
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,210
video where we told you about

74
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,340
Indonesia's impressive growth after

75
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,170
decades of military dictators and

76
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,420
obscenely corrupt leaders sucking money

77
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,890
from the stage like a swamp full of

78
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,260
hungry leeches the Indonesian state is

79
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,420
finally able to invest all of this

80
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,670
started with Joko Widodo the man who

81
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,270
seemingly

82
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,240
has no history of financial skullduggery

83
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,160
[Music]

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,020
this is a tax money going to the

85
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,270
Indonesian Dear Leader's golden toilet

86
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,250
seats it's actually starting to be spent

87
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,350
where it really makes a difference in

88
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,480
infrastructure so the question is how

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,370
does Widodo want to move the Indonesian

90
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,200
capital what's wrong with the currents

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,850
while and most importantly of all can

92
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,500
you really do it while today we're going

93
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
to answer all of these questions but

94
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,820
before we do let's take a look back at

95
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,700
the history

96
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,010
Jakarta the sinking city Indonesia

97
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,450
gained its independence from the

98
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,940
Netherlands in the year 1949 soon they

99
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,740
realized they had a bit of a problem and

100
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,000
just take a look at this Indonesia

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,810
consists of about 17,000 islands so vast

102
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,490
is this country that the distance

103
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,440
between the eastern and western most

104
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,100
parts is over 5,000 kilometers or 3,100

105
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,720
miles if you didn't think that that was

106
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,910
enough the population is over 260

107
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,920
million that's always twice as many

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,260
people as in Russia and you can imagine

109
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,820
that it's a very difficult country to

110
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,160
govern this situation has also had less

111
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,500
obvious consequences as Erik will now

112
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,780
tell us as you can imagine Indonesia

113
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,970
needs very expensive infrastructure to

114
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,980
connect all those islands and right now

115
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,170
it simply doesn't exist so what's the

116
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,700
outcome of all this most of the

117
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,010
population is concentrated on the island

118
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,320
of Java and the capital Jakarta is

119
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,360
overcrowded as you can imagine Indonesia

120
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,340
needs very expensive and expensive

121
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,290
infrastructure to connects those jungle

122
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,360
covered volcanic islands and they don't

123
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,580
have that so what's the outcome of all

124
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,080
of this most population is concentrated

125
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,380
on the islands of Java and the capital

126
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,960
Jakarta is massively overcrowded so on

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,130
the one hand we have a city that

128
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,780
receives more and more people every year

129
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,490
that has no money to build sewer

130
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,620
networks and roads so it's no surprise

131
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,350
when things like this happen

132
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,720
[Music]

133
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,659
Ricardo foots us five billion dollar

134
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,599
annual bill for traffic jams think about

135
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,460
it today there are almost 30 million

136
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,469
people living in Jakarta's metropolitan

137
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:12,599
area since City Hall hasn't built almost

138
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:15,180
any new piping 30% of families haven't

139
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,770
no running water at home so what do they

140
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,389
have to do to get water to drink while

141
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,490
they build illegal wells and this is two

142
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,439
serious consequences first the water

143
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,389
they get from these wells is dirty and

144
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:26,699
often toxic secondly it changes the

145
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,379
consistency of the grounds beneath the

146
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,509
city which has resulted in news like

147
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:36,449
this Jakarta the fastest sinking city in

148
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,550
the world the asleep Jakarta was built

149
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,129
in a very swampy area but with so few

150
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,930
enforced regulations the whole city is

151
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,940
currently sinking at a rate of 15

152
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,949
centimeters per year as the water

153
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,229
beneath the earth is sucked out half a

154
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,090
Carter is below sea level and the

155
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,430
population won't stop growing in ten

156
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,259
years it's expected to surpass Tokyo

157
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,939
currently one of the most populous

158
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,860
cities in the world so what can be done

159
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,110
well our friends Joko Widodo has a

160
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,000
radical solution and that's move the

161
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,219
capital not the city of Jakarta itself

162
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,530
of course just the seat of governments

163
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,360
[Music]

164
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,819
but no he's not just going to name a new

165
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,919
city the capital he's going to build an

166
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,559
entirely new one in the jungles of

167
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:21,020
Borneo this might sound a bit silly but

168
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,789
it actually does make a lot of sense

169
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:24,860
think about it this way if we move the

170
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,599
governments and national institutions

171
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,490
somewhere else all the civil servants

172
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,800
will move with them too and with them a

173
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,419
lot of indirect jobs they're also going

174
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,770
to move as well and that's going to

175
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,020
spread out Indonesian developments okay

176
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,819
but there is a problem the move like

177
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,669
this one is extremely expensive building

178
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,159
a city from scratch takes an absolute

179
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,949
ton of money and the question is does

180
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:48,319
Indonesia even have enough money to do

181
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,569
this well let's find out

182
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:56,910
Joey's legacy yes

183
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,280
governing Indonesia is a hard job but

184
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,380
there are upsides this country has a

185
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,020
cornucopia of natural resources gold oil

186
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,479
gas wood exotic fruits and spices you

187
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,599
name it it's probably on one of those

188
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,849
17,000 islands and as you already know

189
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,620
because I already told you a thousand

190
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,479
times here at visual politic having

191
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,400
natural resources can be a blessing and

192
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,979
it can be a curse in many cases the

193
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,169
money that you get from that wealth ends

194
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,330
up in the pockets of a dictator and this

195
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,949
is what happened with sakano the

196
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,780
founding father of the country after two

197
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,340
decades in power he became one of the

198
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,319
wealthiest men in his time and his

199
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,240
successor wasn't much better

200
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,190
General Suharto was a military dictator

201
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,780
who held power for thirty years and also

202
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,970
became one of the wealthiest men on the

203
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,590
planet here you can see him on the cover

204
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,880
of Time magazine in 1999 how Indonesia's

205
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,739
long time boss built a family fortune

206
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,669
we are talking about approximately

207
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,189
fifteen billion dollars of embezzlement

208
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,649
bribery and looting the state coffers

209
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,289
yes this man became their rich from

210
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:01,149
being the leader of a country in 2004

211
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,860
transparency international ranked the

212
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,869
most corrupt politicians of all time and

213
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:07,209
he won first place the greed of

214
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,269
Berlusconi and Lula da Silva is no match

215
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,999
for this man's insatiable campaign of

216
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,219
theft as you can imagine all this money

217
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:17,319
is simply going to a politician's pocket

218
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,699
is money that didn't go to

219
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,739
infrastructure or anything else for the

220
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:21,519
public good

221
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,619
that matter so what happens when the

222
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:24,999
politician stops stealing while

223
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,469
surprising things look at this

224
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:27,999
impressive feat of development that the

225
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,249
Indonesians are going to enjoy this news

226
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,630
is from March of 2019

227
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,810
[Music]

228
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,220
Indonesia's first subway opens in

229
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,220
traffic choked Jakarta yes really a city

230
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,419
with the national capital and

231
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,310
metropolitan area with 30 million people

232
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,740
had no metro you can imagine why the

233
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,750
Metro has taken more than 30 years since

234
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,640
it was first plant and the big change

235
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,050
that made it possible can be summarized

236
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,190
in two words

237
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,020
Joko Widodo with him mr. Carter's

238
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,700
governor the construction started and

239
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,740
now it has finally been finished with

240
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,540
him as the president's this is pretty

241
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,220
much one of the cornerstones of his

242
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,050
administration infrastructure projects

243
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,700
he has a mega ambitious plan of more

244
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,230
than 300 billion dollars to build

245
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,360
infrastructure all over the place more

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,470
than three thousand kilometers of

247
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,450
railroads highways seaports and airports

248
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,790
many trips have already been reduced to

249
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,280
a third of what they took before imagine

250
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
the difference when it comes to

251
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,070
logistics and passengers

252
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,050
but wait a minute because not everything

253
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,880
is sunshine and rainbows here there is

254
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,500
something missing in this formula and

255
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,360
this is private investments

256
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,759
as you can imagine such ambitious plans

257
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,529
need a lot of money and private money

258
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,689
would be a great help in this regard

259
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,059
this explains partly why despite widows

260
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,879
promise of 7% annual economic growth the

261
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,589
country has been growing at a rate of

262
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,809
just 5 percent the truth is that

263
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,209
Indonesia's very closed country if you

264
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:55,829
have a company and you want to do

265
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,199
business there you must partner with a

266
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,209
local company many industries are still

267
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,589
in the hands of the state and this

268
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,049
explains in part why foreign investment

269
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,350
still only accounts for a 1.5 percent of

270
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,929
the GDP a figure is quite low when

271
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,670
compared to other Asian countries

272
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,480
[Music]

273
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,610
and we have to add to this the labor for

274
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,890
example salaries in this country a 45%

275
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,050
higher than in nearby Vietnam and the

276
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,790
severance for firing a worker is the

277
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,970
world's third highest in this regard we

278
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,500
dodo is not very different from his

279
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,180
predecessors in fact he seems very

280
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,130
determined to scare away investors with

281
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,130
things like this world's biggest gold

282
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,130
mine nationalized in Indonesia all this

283
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,350
is bad news because Indonesia will

284
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,330
really need a lot of investment if they

285
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,580
really want to build a new capital think

286
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,560
about it this way nowadays the capital

287
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,110
is on the island of Java where 60% of

288
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,720
Indonesia's GDP is concentrated the new

289
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,490
capital will be on the northern islands

290
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,160
of Borneo which has just 8% of the GDP

291
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,990
change in the capital will certainly be

292
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,910
missed where Dodos legacy will be his

293
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,190
magnum opus building projects and it

294
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,140
will not be easy according to the

295
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,700
government the total cost will be 33

296
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,040
billion dollars that's the price of two

297
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,620
Olympic Games Widodo has already said

298
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,570
that the government can fund only 20% of

299
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,370
this the other 80% will have to come

300
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,400
from private investors

301
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,550
[Music]

302
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,080
and the reality is private investors are

303
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,330
not going to come if they don't do

304
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,280
big-time reform to their antique

305
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,050
business systems so now we want to ask

306
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,820
you what do you think about with Dodos

307
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,650
moving up the Capitol well its help

308
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,990
Indonesia climb out of poverty and would

309
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,610
you like to change the capital of your

310
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,590
