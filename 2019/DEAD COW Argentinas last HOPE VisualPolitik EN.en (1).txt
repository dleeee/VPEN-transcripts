you may have noticed that lately we've

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,320
been talking a lot about Argentina here

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,250
you're right we've made a lot of videos

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,490
about the country of tango but well what

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,140
do you want me to say Argentina is a

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,300
very interesting country after all can

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,130
you tell me any other country this in

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,800
the last six decades on average has had

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,560
to negotiate a rescue with the IMF every

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,020
four and a half years Argentina is

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,550
essentially the country of crises Monday

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,489

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,670
second biggest crash since 1954 any

Argentina's current affairs were not

00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,520
the country has been experiencing since

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,740
2015 and which has forced it to

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,560
negotiate with the IMF yet again on this

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,110
occasion the rescue amounts to no less

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,080
than 56 billion dollars obviously having

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,580
so many economic problems has

38
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,350
consequences during the last hundred

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,420
years Argentina has gone from being one

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,580
of the ten richest countries on the

is at the level of Belarus Turkmenistan

or Iran and worst of all it's ranking

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,619
keep song falling but in recent years

46
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,210
the dream has spread through Argentina

47
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,819
and with it the hope that once and for

48
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:04,530
all they'll be able to leave their

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,080
problems behind in the 19th century war

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,149
was Argentina's cash cow at the

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:10,890
beginning of the last century it was

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,560
beef the famous Argentine meat in the

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,540
mid twentieth century it was Whedon's

54
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,850
now many hope that oil and gas will

55
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,280
change the country's fate and this hope

56
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,870

great treasures but hold on a second

64
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,010
what on earth is the dead cow deal

66
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,000
that's the obvious first question dead

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
cow is a geological formation that can

68
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,410
turn this country into a gas exporting

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,240

00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,220
Patagonia near the Andes and in the

71
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,350
middle of an arid and lonely steppe dead

72
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,960
cow is the reason for news stories like

73
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,560
this dead cow Joon's gas production was

74
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,960
the highest in 11 years last month there

75
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,210
was a total of 140 million cubic meters

76
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,310
per day produced which means an annual

77
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,590
growth of 5.8% the largest gas

78
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,630
production in 11 years

79
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,670
by the way this isn't strictly a new

80
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,290
discovery the dead cow site was

81
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,570
discovered by American geologist Charles

82
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,640
Weaver back in 1931 however until

83
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,680
relatively recently nothing could be

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,150
done with it dead cow is an

85
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,430
unconventional hydrocarbon deposits that

86
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,280
is shale oil when oil is extracted and

87
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,060
shale gas when gas is extracted in this

88
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,190
site hydrocarbons are distributed

89
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,110
throughout a 30,000 square kilometer

90
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,690
surface area an area equivalent to twice

91
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,760
the size of Kuwait there's only one

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,270
problem

93
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,620
unlike the Middle East where you only

94
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,410
need to prick the soil to get oil or gas

95
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,170
to spout out here in dead cow territory

96
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,390
all those precious hydrocarbon resources

97
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,380
are about 3,000 metres below the surface

98
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,120
[Music]

99
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,370
so yes it's very tricky situation indeed

100
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,470
and hold on a second because that's not

101
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,150
all there is another even worse problem

102
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,799
in this case the oil and gas is trapped

103
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,930
within the rock so to exploit them a

104
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,790
well must be built through which a

105
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,800
pressurized substance is injected to

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,930
fracture the rock so that the oil and

107
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,910
gas can be released through that well

108
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,860
it's a matter of pressure when oil and

109
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,930
gas are released from the rocks these

110
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,420
compounds emerge with huge force it's

111
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,250
something similar to opening a shaken

112
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,000
bottle of soda

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,050
exactly we're talking about the

114
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,170
controversial fracking or hydraulic

115
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,250
fracture that's why they couldn't

116
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,290
exploit dead cow until relatively

117
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,210
recently now at this point there's a

118
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,890
question I know many of you might be

119
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,320
thinking exactly how much oil and how

120
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,060
much gas are we talking about because

121
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,980
well that's the key issue could the dead

122
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,230
cow site really represents this big

beginning

140
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,589
today dead cow is considered to be at

least the second largest unconventional

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,699
exploitable reserves amounts to sixteen

00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,300
these figures really equate to

151
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,510
well to give you an idea 16 billion

152
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,460
barrels of oil equals twice the

153
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,200
conventional reserves of countries like

154
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,290
Norway or Angola it's almost 60 years of

155
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,080
Argentina's oil consumption and as for

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
natural gas

157
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,750
Argentina's current consumption is

158
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,000
approximately a trillion cubic feet per

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,740

160
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,870
just the exploitable reserves of dead

161
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,550
cow three hundred eight trillion cubic

162
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,350
feet of natural gas that amounts to

163
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,650
almost 300 years of gas consumption in

164
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,120
Argentina dead cow might as well be

165
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,640
called cash cow because the place is so

166
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,419
flush with oil and gas

167
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,770
all this means that within a few years

168
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,779
Argentina could have an important

00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,119
competitive advantage cheap energy and

170
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,309
nothing suits industry better than

00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:59,050
having cheap energy on the other hands

172
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,449
the country may also dove into exporting

173
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,459
natural gas not only to its Latin

174
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,349
American neighbors but also to the rest

175
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:09,789
of the world especially Asia now that's

176
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,860
interesting because surely most of you

177
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,050
are worried about sustainability and the

178
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,899

and for lower polluting energy sources

tab leading role however to reach this

182
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,399
point there's a much more urgent step

183
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,499
that needs to be taken replacing coal in

production processes especially in

185
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,219

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,080
if its enormous population and heavy

190
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,419
reliance on coal China is by far the

191
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,430
world's biggest polluter responsible for

192
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,830
more emissions in the US and EU combined

193
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,869
in this mission both for cost and

194
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,460
technology natural gas works like a

195
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,919
charm and is certainly much cleaner than

196
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,930
oil and coal so even if we speak in

197
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,939
terms of sustainability dead cow is

198
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,279
great news dead cow is already having

199
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,020
very positive consequences for the

200
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,180
Argentine economy

201
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:10,320
[Music]

202
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,790
you see the lack of investments in the

203
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,470
decline of old deposits of course

204
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,260
d'argent ena since 2008 to import a huge

205
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,090
amount of natural gas and oil which of

206
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,160
course spent a much higher trade balance

207
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,560
deficit and a huge exodus of dollars

208
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,450
from the country however now that's

209
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,850
beginning to change crude oil production

210
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,000
has run for 16 months of uninterrupted

211
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,190
annual growth the unconventional oil

212
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,620
which is increased by 47 percent already

213
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,780
represents 18 percent of total

214
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,640
production Argentina has not had to

215
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,130
resort to oil imports for 14 months

216
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,680
Gustavo Liberty gwei Secretary of Energy

217
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,990
for Argentina I with natural gas is a

218
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,690
similar story since 2017 net imports

219
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,000
have decreased by more than 50 percent

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,769
obviously without this change

221
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,959
Argentina's ongoing crisis would have

222
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,509
been even worse what's more if Mauricio

223
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,910
Macri were to get reelected the first

224
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,160
thing he should do is go kiss the earth

225
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,949
a dead cow the point is that if this

226
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,410
site is put to work at full capacity the

227
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,180
impact on the country's foreign balance

228
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,889
could be huge according to Carlos Olmec

229
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,079
higher presidents of tack patrol one of

230
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,490
the companies that is working on the

231
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,990
site we would be talking about a

232
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,759
positive impact of about 30 billion

233
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,399
dollars per year 20 billion in export

234
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,199
and 10 billion dollars which wouldn't be

235
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,000
spent on buying hydrocarbons from

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,620
outside the country and of course the

237
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,779
country really could use all those

238
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,699
dollars to overcome its external

239
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,550
imbalances from the imf's rescue would

240
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,220
go into dead cows mega rescue but hold

241
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,379
on a second because things are not that

242
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:59,819
straightforward

243
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:04,779
always politics one question here in the

244
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,540
Arab soul discovery from 2011 that we

245
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,430
mentioned well that huge news was

246
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,379
actually the beginning of many many

247
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,680
problems without much money involved the

248
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
then Argentinian presidents Cristina

249
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,189
Fernandez de Kirchner made a

250
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:20,439
controversial decision who's forcefully

251
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,689
nationalized the YP F company the

252
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,699
largest Argentine oil company in which

253
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,949
at the time was part of the Repsol group

254
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,509
suddenly the Argentine government took

255
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,839
over ins everything stopped after its

256
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,800
nationalization they had to deal with a

257
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
very long judicial process which ended

258
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,220
up costing the country a lot of money

259
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,740
and also international investments they

260
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,010
just completely stopped

261
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,440
and the oil and gas sector is one that

262
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,839
requires huge investments of billions of

263
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,730
dollars Indians the project almost

264
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,300
stopped

265
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,820
however in 2015 when Mauricio Macri came

266
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,560
to power the project came to life again

267
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,889
and a rain of millions began to exploit

268
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,530
this great treasure

269
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,360
but a lot more is still needed will

270
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,430
Argentine politicians allow dead cow to

271
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,110
develop will Argentina be able to take

272
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,970
advantage of this great resource well
