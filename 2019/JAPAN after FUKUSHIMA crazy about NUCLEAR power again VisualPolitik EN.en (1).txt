00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,890
this video is made possible by blinkers

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,060
the first hundred people to go to

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,069
blinkers calm forward-slash visual

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,720
politic are going to get unlimited

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,179
access for one week to try it out you'll

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,920
also get 25% off if you want the full

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,080
membership more about that later

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,070
for now let's get on with it

9
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,620
[Applause]

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,050
[Music]

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,280
Japan is the country with the greatest

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,500
reason to be scared of nuclear power

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,150
think about it they have the biggest

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,400
nuclear trauma record in the world

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,530
[Music]

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,390
so bath they are the only country that

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,000
has suffered a nuclear attack namely the

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,220
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings in fact

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,800
during the 50s nuclear paranoia was big

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,900
in Japan the most famous outcome of this

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,000
is the movie Godzilla the story of a

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,739
gigantic radioactive lizard that

23
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,600
destroys cities nonetheless as the

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,550
Japanese economy grew Japan started

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,350
building its own reactors a couple of

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,879
decades later they became the third

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,860
biggest nuclear power house only

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,800
surpassed by America and France yep you

29
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,090
heard that right while European

30
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,739
countries like Germany were organizing

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,380
all kinds of anti-nuclear demonstrations

32
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,590
Japan blindly a trusted uranium

33
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,710
[Music]

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,720
but then as the Japanese were being

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,030
charmed by atomic power the unexpected

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:25,200
happens Japan Earthquake explosion at

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,390
Fukushima power plant a powerful

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,370
explosion has hit a nuclear power

39
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,830
station in northeastern Japan which is

40
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,410
badly damaged in Friday's devastating

41
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,150
earthquake and tsunami overnight a

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,640
nuclear panic came back to Japan into

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
the whole world and that was a good

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,610
reason for it you see during the

45
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,860
Chernobyl accident in 1986 many people

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,810
said that the problem is a nuclear power

47
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,729
is the fact that Chernobyl didn't follow

48
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,020
the security protocols

49
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,270
you know the Soviets but Japan it's a

50
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,490
wealthy country that takes extreme care

51
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,440
with its security and despite all of

52
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,110
this Fukushima we're still a disaster

53
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,300
all of a sudden Japan shut down all of

54
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,100
their nuclear power plants they went

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,990
from having 30% nuclear power in the

56
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,380
energy mix to just a tiny 3% so now you

57
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,540
might assume that Japan is turning into

58
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,120
an anti-nuclear country right well as

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,920
you might have guessed the opposite is

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,940
actually true

61
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,430
[Music]

62
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,740
20 to 22 percent share of nuclear power

63
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,040
at core of updated energy policy nuclear

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,560
power has come back to Japan in fact not

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,840
only Japan as we said in previous videos

66
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,610
the whole Asian continent is going

67
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,950
through a nuclear revolution and when I

68
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,660
say the whole continents I really mean

69
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,460
it from wealthy countries like Japan to

70
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,740
poor countries like Bangladesh and this

71
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,510
is surprising if we take into account

72
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,090
that nuclear reactors were far from

73
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,860
cheap in this other video we told you

74
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,690
about what's going on in China but today

75
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,980
we're going to focus on what's happening

76
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,500
in the two other biggest Asian countries

77
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,900
Japan and India because the question we

78
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,490
want to address today is what about

79
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,070
nuclear power appeals to Asians so much

80
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,590
and how is India still a poor country

81
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,170
become such a nuclear power house well

82
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,820
today we are going to answer these

83
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,560
questions but before we do there's

84
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,270
always let's take a look back at the

85
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:13,810
history the nuclear giant is back

86
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,630
Fukushima meant an immediate nuclear

87
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,670
shutdown the Japanese wanted to minimize

88
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,470
risk and stopped all their reactors

89
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,510
basically overnight same are you

90
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,010
wondering well where if they'd gotten

91
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,260
their energy from since then I mean how

92
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,180
did they replace the energy input that

93
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,100
they used to get from nuclear power well

94
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,170
the answer is complete ecological Harry

95
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,700
Caray yep you heard that right

96
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,709
if you thought nuclear power was bad for

97
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:37,840
the environment most of the alternatives

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,709
they're even worse

99
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,900
without uranium Japan had to start using

100
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,310
fossil fuels and this had two

101
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,400
consequences electricity prices rose 20%

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,469
because suddenly they had to buy tons of

103
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,329
liquefied natural gas the other

104
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,310
consequence was that co2 emissions

105
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,129
absolutely skyrocketed in other words if

106
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,480
Godzilla happened to show up in

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,819
Fukushima he would have to wear a mask

108
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,859
and I know what you might be thinking

109
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,019
why don't they use renewable sources I

110
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,430
mean what's the problem with green

111
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,620
energy well the problem is time if you

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,030
want to have solar panels and wind

113
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,950
turbines first you have to build them

114
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,019
and Japan is far behind other countries

115
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,379
in this regard

116
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,419
in fact is only now that they're

117
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,340
starting their green energy plan their

118
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,410
goal is to achieve 22% of their energy

119
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,900
from renewable sources by 2030 for

120
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,699
comparison Europe plans to achieve the

121
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,669
same in 2020 how mainly because Europe

122
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,379
started investing in these technologies

123
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,900
way sooner but only that even if Japan

124
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,759
wanted to speed up their green energy

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,409
plan they couldn't one of their main

126
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,569
problems is red tape want to start a

127
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:45,729
wind turbine park well you need five

128
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,280
years of paper work to be done this is

129
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,509
three times longer than most

130
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,729
industrialized countries and reducing

131
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:53,259
the red tape there it's almost

132
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,190
impossible

133
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,940
[Music]

134
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,680
and also let's not forget the classic

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,210
problem with green energy and that's

136
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,100
that it's incredibly expensive to store

137
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,020
electricity using these methods for

138
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,580
example solar panels only give you

139
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,500
energy during the day and the same goes

140
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,630
for wind turbines you only get energy

141
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,060
when it's windy during a calm night you

142
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,950
still need to use other energy sources

143
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,590
so realistically Japan has only two

144
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,900
options fan er G they can keep important

145
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,760
expensive gas and polluting like crazy

146
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,940
or they can go nuclear and the answer it

147
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,410
seems to be a bit of a no-brainer for

148
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,390
them

149
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,580
Japan restarts 5 nuclear power reactors

150
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,310
in 2018 in total at the time we made

151
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,680
this video Japan has already restarted 9

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,930
nuclear reactors but it's not only that

153
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,580
they're restarting at the capacity they

154
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,890
previously have they want to build even

155
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,260
more process begins at sh'mon a nuclear

156
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,510
plant to operate new reactor you see

157
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,160
when you're talking about nuclear power

158
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,140
there's one important thing you must

159
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,210
understand they produce energy on an

160
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,580
ongoing basis this means from the moment

161
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,260
you start a reactor you have the same

162
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,690
amount of energy every single day no

163
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,150
more no less this is why nuclear power

164
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,120
is considered the base of an electrical

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
system turning off a nuclear reactor is

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,470
very expensive and it's only done when

167
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,150
there's a real risk of an accident

168
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,530
that's why they're always producing

169
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,160
energy

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,820
[Music]

171
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,940
and you put on top of that nuclear

172
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,490
energy other energy sources such as coal

173
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,490
gas or green energy these are energy

174
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,770
sources that can be adjusted based on

175
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,080
the energy demands of a particular day

176
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,550
nevertheless if we said green energy

177
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,480
depends on the weather

178
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,240
coal or gas depends on market prices and

179
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,760
these fluctuate daily nonetheless you

180
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,770
just need a little piece of uranium to

181
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,990
have nuclear power so price fluctuations

182
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,330
on this material they don't affect the

183
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,190
cost that much this is the reason why

184
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,710
Japan is going back to nuclear but it's

185
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,420
not only Japan in South Korea they're

186
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:01,080
also mastering this form of energy while

187
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,730
in North Korea they build nukes their

188
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,250
southern neighbors built reactors in

189
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,410
total they have six of them and I am I

190
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,600
wonder well who builds all these nuclear

191
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,070
power plants I mean the truth is that

192
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,960
nuclear power it's really complicated

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,150
and it's really expensive and indeed

194
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,770
there are very few companies that have

195
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,510
mastered these technologies remember

196
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,800
those reactors built by Japan in the

197
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,110
1960s well they were built by British

198
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,330
and American companies for years General

199
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,160
Electric and Westinghouse dominated the

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,780
market but soon Toshiba

201
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,360
Hitachi and Mitsubishi started their own

202
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,040
generation of models South Korea

203
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,510
followed suits they started buying

204
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,760
American French and Canadian models but

205
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,460
then I owned I do CERN and kepco started

206
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,320
manufacturing their own reactors now

207
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,240
South Korea is another nuclear power

208
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,950
house that exports the technology all

209
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,600
over the world

UAE and South Korea celebrate completion

212
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,930
of Baraka's first nuclear reactor and I

213
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,300
knew I was a well okay but how much does

214
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,699
a nuclear reactor cost to give you an

215
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,500
idea all of the reactors that they want

216
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,419
to build in the Arabian Peninsula cost

217
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,669
twenty billion dollars this is about the

218
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,259
cost of hosting the Olympic Games by the

219
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:07,610
way just to make you embarrassed in a

220
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,050
fossil fuel plant that generates the

221
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,240
same amounts of energy costs 20 times

222
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,610
less of course producing a kilowatt of

223
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,259
electricity with nuclear power is the

224
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,210
cheapest way to do so but the initial

225
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,030
outlay is only affordable to very rich

226
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,160
economies so then how on earth is it

227
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,410
possible that India and Bangladesh can

228
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,300
have nuclear reactors well let's have a

229
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,340
look

230
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,940

231
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,919
from Godzilla to go Cola

232
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,260
Japan has Godzilla India has go Cola if

233
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,550
you didn't know after the commercial

234
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,470
success of Godzilla Bollywood created

235
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,200
their own exploitation version and this

236
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,750
is the giant Cola

237
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,280
[Music]

238
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,870
but enough with the movies when it comes

239
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,730
to energy we've got the same story if

240
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,890
Japan had nuclear power plants India

241
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,990
wanted the same the problem American

242
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,730
companies didn't want to sell reactors

243
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,750
to India why

244
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,660
mainly because India has nukes yep you

245
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,950
heard that right the country of Gandhi

246
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,420
and non-violence is one of the few

247
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,460
nations with nukes and their biggest

248
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,040
enemy Pakistan also has them so there's

249
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,050
a real danger that one day they're going

250
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,430
to use them in other words America

251
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,110
doesn't want to help India go even more

252
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,460
nuclear but that's not even the most

253
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,770
interesting part you see unlike Japan

254
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,870
and South Korea India has its own

255
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,270
uranium mines so since America didn't

256
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,830
want to help them they went to France

257
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,870
and to Russia this is why many of the

258
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,120
nuclear reactors in India are built by a

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,310
rasa tahn the Russian company but here's

260
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,870
the really interesting part Indian

261
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,790
reactors have something very special

262
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,890
about them they're cheaper than anywhere

263
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,500
else why because they're the only ones

264
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,380
that use natural uranium you see most of

265
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,240
the world's reactors use enriched

266
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,090
uranium this is uranium that cannot be

267
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,430
used to manufacture nuclear bombs and

268
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,980
this is why buying and rich uranium is

269
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,540
sort of easy but there are many

270
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,970
restrictions to get natural uranium you

271
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,260
see if you go to buy natural uranium

272
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,390
someone's gonna be like whoa whoa hold

273
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,550
on a second there cowboy what exactly

274
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,080
you're gonna use that for because since

275
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,089
India has its own uranium they can do

276
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,500
whatever they want with it this is why

277
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,839
their natural uranium reactors away

278
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,600
cheaper and it explains news like this

279
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,270
[Music]

280
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,550
India plans tenfold uranium output

281
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,440
growth India is currently building seven

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,120
nuclear reactors but they plan to build

283
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,580
20 more as I said they're using mainly

284
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,070
Russian technology bands as you know

285
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,900
since Rossi tom was doing business in

286
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,760
the region they went to neighboring

287
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,210
Bangladesh and they made this Raza Tom

288
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,880
starts work on unit two of Bangladesh

289
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,950
end project with this Vangel adesh will

290
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,020
cover 20% of their energy demands with

291
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,000
nuclear power and the same is happening

292
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,339
in Pakistan dorama our previous video

293
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,440
where we told you how China is starting

294
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,089
to create its own nuclear technology

295
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,430
well Pakistan is the one buying from the

296
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,470
Chinese in other words nuclear power is

297
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,370
not a rich country business anymore

298
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,260
is getting crazy over us so I really

299
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,090
hope you enjoyed that video it's made

300
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,730
possible of course by blankest do you

301
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,380
manage to read all of the books that you

302
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,300
want to read probably not right we all

303
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,310
lead busy lives and that can sometimes

304
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,720
mean you don't get the knowledge you

305
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,190
need it's harder and harder to find the

306
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,680
time to learn in the modern world I mean

307
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,930
all of those distracting videos over

308
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,700
there on the left somewhere really

309
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,140
tempting to click on the good news is

310
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,420
that even if you don't have time you can

311
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,480
still learn with blinkers blinkers is an

312
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,040
app that takes the best insight to

313
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,840
need-to-know info from thousands of

314
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,430
non-fiction books and condenses them

315
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,990
into 15 minutes which you can either

316
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,300
read or you can listen to they have a

317
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,610
huge library and they've got eight

318
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,220
million users for me I'm probably the

319
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,260
ideal blinkers customer I spent a lot of

320
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,410
time working making these videos and far

321
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,760
less time learning than I probably

322
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,650
should they got tons of popular titles

323
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,630
like the 4-hour workweek from Tim

324
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,520
Ferriss one I read a while ago and

325
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,710
recaps recently there's also tons of

326
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,300
political books if you want to take a

327
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,680
look back at the history like we say

328
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,150
here on visual politic they've got books

329
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,250
condensed like the Silk Roads by Peter

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,540
blink is calm forward smashing visual

332
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,710

00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,840
access for one week to try it out you'll

334
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,150
also get 25% off the full membership

335
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,530
move fast

336
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,750
grab on those political books or well

337
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,460
whatever you want really the seven day

338
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,020
trial is completely free and you can

339
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,090
cancel at any time during that trial if

340
