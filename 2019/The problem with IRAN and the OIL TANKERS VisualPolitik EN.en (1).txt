1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,010
this map represents the real backbone of

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,259
the world's economy this is one of the

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,200
most important enclaves on the planet

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,099
the strait of hormuz maybe this is the

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,480
first time you've heard of this place

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,090
nevertheless one out of five oil barrels

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,070
brought across the globe departs from

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,140
here most of the Gulf's production comes

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,840
from this port

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,390
as you can see we have three country sir

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,390
the United Arab Emirates Amman and the

12
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,210
Islamic Republic of Iran so this place

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,699
it could become the battlefield for a

14
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,280
war between America and Iran and believe

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,590
me the scenario it actually seems pretty

16
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,480
likely in fact the only reason there is

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
no war between these two countries now

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,540
is because of a last-minute decision

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,449
taken by Donald Trump himself by the end

20
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,460
of this video you'll understand what's

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,620
going on in this very important region

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,010
of the world

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,550
[Applause]

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,750
[Music]

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,159
let's be clear here oil is the lifeblood

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,799
of today's economy maybe one day this

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,680
will change but nowadays whether we like

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,759
it or not we need our dinosaur juice

29
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,140
eventually everything and most of this

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,690
crude is carried on tankers this

31
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,200
explains why news like this is quite so

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,780
worrisome oil tanker attacks in the

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,729
Strait of Hormuz requires an

34
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,300
international response US envoy to Iran

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,910
says at the time this video was made six

36
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,070
oil tankers have been attacked some Z

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,960
button limpet mines on the ship hulls

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,820
live in mines are not very powerful

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,280
explosives but they are destructive

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,710
enough to make a hole in the hull so the

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,200
ship cannot set sail and I might be

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,140
wondering well who planted these limpet

43
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,390
mines at this moment on nobody knows for

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,670
sure but Donald Trump believes that this

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,310
was Iran's doing think about it with the

46
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,590
nuclear sanctions Iran can hardly sell

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,020
its oil to anybody this is why the White

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,909
House believes since they can't export

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,579
crude they decided to close the Strait

50
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,600
of Hormuz

51
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,310
add to this the fact that America hates

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,770
Iran in Saudi Arabia hates Iran even

53
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,780
more and of course how the Arabia is

54
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,730
America's best friend especially under

55
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,560
Trump's administration so in other words

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,870
Washington doesn't need many excuses to

57
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,140
attacked Iran and Iran is making it even

58
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,120
easier for them in fact in response to

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,980
those attacks on the tankers America's

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,900
tempted roamed the Iranian coast the

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,420
drone was knocked down by a missile sent

62
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,910
by Iran the situation it was extremely

63
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,950
tense but it could get even worse

64
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,849
[Music]

65
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:47,489
just think about it so far we're talking

66
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,980
about holes in ships and knocks down

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,709
drone but no human losses this is where

68
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:54,480
Trump had to make a decision so the

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,090
answer the attack on this drone or not

70
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,980
an air strike on the region would surely

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,290
mean the deaths of Iranian people and if

72
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,810
America killed Iranians Iran would want

73
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,909
to kill Americans and in that situation

74
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,310
a dead American soldier would be more

75
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,200
than enough that Donald Trump to start a

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
war against Iran that's exactly when you

77
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,819
rage a group a consultancy said that

78
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,829
there was a 40 percent chance that the

79
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,840
air strike would start a war and then

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,700
against the odds Donald Trump made a

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,520
rather sensible last-minute decision

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,689
[Applause]

83
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:29,250
Monday they shot down an unmanned drone

84
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,799
flying in international waters we were

85
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,230
cocked and loaded to retaliate last

86
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,180
night on three different sites when I

87
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,430
asked how many will die under 50 people

88
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,439
sir was the answer from the general 10

89
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,319
minutes before the strike I stopped it

90
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,790
Donald Trump on Twitter is there now the

91
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,859
question is how did we get it there's a

92
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,379
war between America and Iran really that

93
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,419
probable how responsible would Donald

94
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:53,459
Trump be for it and most important of

95
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,099
all who is attacking these tankers well

96
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,419
today we are going to answer all of

97
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,340
these questions but before we do let's

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,950
take a look back at the history

99
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,570
unintended consequences on visual

100
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,370
politic we have a series of videos

101
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,530
devoted to the Iran sanctions if you

102
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,660
want to understand all of this in depth

103
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,310
you should check it out but don't make a

104
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,989
quick summary for everyone who's the new

105
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,359
to this channel for years Iran was

106
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,340
isolated from international trade as

107
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,350
punishment for its nuclear program in

108
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,870
the year 2015 Obama made a deal with

109
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,090
Tehran basically the United States would

110
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,010
lift most of the trade embargo in

111
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,930
exchange for Iran stopping its

112
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,550
manufacturing of nukes

113
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,520
all of a sudden Iran could restart its

114
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,910
oil exports

115
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,340
[Music]

116
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,900
but a year later Trump came to office

117
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,790
one of his first policies was to break

118
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,340
that nuclear deal with Iran according to

119
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,290
him Iran never stopped its nuclear

120
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,750
program despite what anybody said so

121
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,030
from one day to the next America went

122
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,220
back to the embargo the Trumpy didn't

123
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,630
stop here his goal was to make the

124
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,660
entire world stop trading with Iran not

125
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,610
just American companies and this is

126
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,500
where an important question was raised

127
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,260
why would a European company obey what

128
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,850
Washington set well

129
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,710
months later we can say that Trump won

130
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,570
that fight most of the world has stopped

131
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,430
investing in Iran this includes Renault

132
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,770
factories and French oil rigs as you can

133
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,750
imagine this has had terrible

134
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,050
consequences for Iran's economy

135
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,740
[Music]

136
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,080
Iran's latest inflation figure tops 50%

137
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,710
food prices jump 85 percent yep you

138
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,190
heard that right

139
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,050
despite Iran having the world's fourth

140
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,360
largest oil reserves nobody dares to buy

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,070
from them so the country is on the edge

142
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,880
of collapse

143
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,350
and on top of all that there are

144
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,790
protests happening against the

145
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,620
government at this point I know what

146
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,930
many of you might be thinking is this

147
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,660
the end of the ayatollah regime in fact

148
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,790
no the opposite is true what is

149
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,710
happening is what we predicted months

150
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,570
ago air at visual politic by the way

151
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,190
this is a good moment to remind you that

152
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,870
we published brand new videos every week

153
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,180
so you should subscribe to this channel

154
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,770
and hit that Bell button when you hit

155
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,360
the bell bus and you actually receive a

156
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,890
notification about when we post new

157
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,200
videos which is nice it means you don't

158
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,460
miss out so you're always up to date

159
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,810
with the best understanding of the

160
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,790
world's politics that's a win-win so as

161
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,770
we said on that video several months ago

162
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,080
in Iranian politics there are three main

163
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,150
factions reformists moderates and

164
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,310
radicals Iran's current president Hassan

165
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,100
rouhani is a moderate this is why he was

166
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,230
willing to reach that nuclear deal with

167
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,990
America

168
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,760
but after the conversations failed his

169
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,350
political capital fell to its lowest

170
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,530
point and who wins in this scenario well

171
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,570
yes that would be the radicals those who

172
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,280
wanted to keep the nuclear program as

173
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,470
any constant never wanted to talk with

174
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,990
the White House so among these radicals

175
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,330
we have a very important group the

176
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,850
Islamic Revolutionary Guard the Islamic

177
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,890
Revolutionary Guard is an elite group

178
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,440
created in order to maintain the values

179
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,810
of the ayatollah revolution they are the

180
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,910
state-of-the-art weapons and world-class

181
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,770
trainings and believe me they have never

182
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,040
been as powerful as they are right now

183
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,700
[Music]

184
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,260
iran's elite defense force finds new

185
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,690
funding sources as tensions rise with

186
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,910
the u.s. as you know iran plays its role

187
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,980
as regional power and it participates in

188
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,410
foreign wars the group that trains the

189
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,450
pro-iranian warriors in countries like

190
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,940
Syria Lebanon and Yemen is this

191
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,040
Revolutionary Guard in recent years the

192
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,080
troops trained by them have increased by

193
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,630
20% for example Hezbollah or the Houthi

194
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,550
rebels are so deadly because of this

195
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,230
training and so how does this

196
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,910
Revolutionary Guard get its funding

197
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,439
while that's with state monopolies

198
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,749
a good share of Iran's economy is in

199
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,519
their hands for example the Iranian

200
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,469
telecom company is owned by them and in

201
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,449
the past few years many other businesses

202
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,429
are falling under their control here's

203
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,559
another example total is a French oil

204
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,239
company with the Trump sanctions they

205
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,669
had to abandon all of their oil rigs so

206
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,970
guess who's taking them now yeah exactly

207
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,529
[Music]

208
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,839
girge drill into Iran's gas potential in

209
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,459
other words Iran's economy is like a

210
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,559
cake now the cake is getting smaller and

211
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,179
smaller but the Revolutionary Guard is

212
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:16,189
having a bigger and bigger share of us

213
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,139
at this moment we can say that they are

214
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,939
more powerful than the President himself

215
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:26,089
and this explains news like this brand

216
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,069
new cloutie enriched Iranian limit will

217
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:30,649
be breached on June 27th in other words

218
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,509
officially Iran is restarting its

219
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,250
nuclear program if Trump thought that

220
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,379
sanctions would push the Ayatollah into

221
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,389
that corner his plan has just backfired

222
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,550
but hold on a minute now because if you

223
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,899
thought the situation couldn't get any

224
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:43,969
worse well pay attention to this next

225
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:44,650
chapter

226
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,120
[Music]

227
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,090
got war in Yemen has sort of become the

228
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,460
Arab Vietnam Yemen is the only poor

229
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,440
country in the Arabian Peninsula and

230
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,300
this is the battlefield on which the

231
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,310
Saudis and the Iranians fight their

232
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,860
proxy war initially this was meant to be

233
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,720
a quick war at the end of the day Saudi

234
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,270
Arabia has the third most expensive army

235
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,130
on the planet with top-notch weaponry

236
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,340
American support and tons and tons of

237
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,590
money but as we explained in a previous

238
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,020
video money can buy good weapons but it

239
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,360
cannot buy a good strategy this is why

240
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,010
those who the rebels are causing such a

241
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,650
big headache for the Saudis

242
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,890
and this is a hell of a problem despite

243
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,600
losing the war the Saudis have enough

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,070
money to keep fighting without

245
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,960
surrendering theirs honors America and

246
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,690
the UK keep sending weapons Saudi Arabia

247
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,640
will keep bombing and as long as Iran

248
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,590
keeps supporting the Houthis the war in

249
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,750
Yemen won't budge nowadays the violence

250
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,280
in the region is so insane that it's

251
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,120
reached beyond Yemeni borders the toothy

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,730
rebels strike Saudi Airport this year in

253
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,310
2019 the Houthi rebels attacked a power

254
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,380
plant and an oil pipe and Saudi

255
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,510
territory but if you thought that was

256
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,310
bad enough here's the news that has

257
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,710
shaken the world's economic backbone oil

258
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,500
tankers attacked the Gulf of Oman at the

259
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,510
time this video was made six oil tankers

260
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,950
have been attacked who orchestrated

261
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,420
these attacks we still don't know

262
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,880
America thinks Iran is behind this and

263
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,160
it seems reasonable that you see rebels

264
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,960
did this these rebels have Iranian

265
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,090
training but they might be acting on

266
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,780
their own behalf

267
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,390
not only that remember that the ones who

268
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,850
are training this group are the Islamic

269
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,220
Revolutionary Guard and those boys they

270
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,110
don't need to arms permission to do

271
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,740
anything

272
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,660
in other words perhaps rouhani doesn't

273
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,540
want to attack oil tankers but even if

274
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,640
it was him he might not be able to

275
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,530
control the Houthi rebels

276
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,020
[Music]

277
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,390
anyway this is all just speculation the

278
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,010
truth is at the time we made this video

279
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,530
nobody has claimed responsibility for

280
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,530
these attacks meanwhile America has sent

281
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,910
1,500 troops to the area this means that

282
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,040
so far Uncle Sam can secure the Strait

283
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,530
of Hormuz but there are still big risks

284
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,180
you see no matter how much military

285
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,950
presence you have there can always be

286
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,290
somebody putting a mine on one of those

287
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,090
tankers doesn't have to be a big attack

288
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,370
nobody dies but this mine is big enough

289
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,890
to blast a hole in the hull and stop the

290
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,480
tanker from sailing what does this all

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,220
mean what this means that the companies

292
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,840
that insure those tankers might raise

293
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,700
their premiums and this would have a

294
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,150
direct effect on oil prices worldwide

295
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,100
all of this means that whatever military

296
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,200
presence they send America needs a

297
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,480
diplomatic solution but Iranians they

298
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,610
don't trust Donald Trump after all he is

299
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,410
the one who broke a previously signed

300
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,590
deal so well you can do this job nice of

301
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,580

[Music]

303
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,500
our man in Tokyo wherever Shinzo are

304
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,180
they the Japanese Prime Minister anytime

305
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,130
we talk about him on visual politic it's

306
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,590
because we're talking about economics a

307
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,600
crisis or the Olympic Games

308
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,430
the truth is Japan has never been big on

309
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,490
diplomacy until now in June of 2019

310
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,350
Shinzo our they traveled to Tehran to

311
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,060
hold negotiations on behalf of Donald

312
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,310
Trump at the end of the day who wouldn't

313
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,440
trust the Japanese I mean who wouldn't

314
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,850
want to have a beer with that guy I mean

315
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,470
or accept his friendship request on

316
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,750
Facebook it's uncle Shinzo your Japanese

317
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,180
best friends Joe did this plan work well

318
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,290
the answer is a clear and resounding no

319
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,010
[Music]

320
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,720
to Japan bound tank who's reportedly

321
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,029
attacked near Strait of Hormuz that's

322
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:26,460
what I call not receiving somebody with

323
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,180
open arms

324
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,980
so in conclusion Shinzo our they

325
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,050
returned home sad and Donald Trump

326
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,300
started to do his thing after the attack

327
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,950
on those tankers America sent the drone

328
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,410
Duke spy on the Iranian coast and what

329
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,089
do you think happens well I told you

330
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:41,160
before the Iranian army they shot it out

331
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,200
of the sky and right at this moment the

332
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,940
tension was higher than ever at this

333
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,980
very moment the Consultancy erasure

334
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,170
group raised the chance of war from 30

335
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,240
to 40 percent and it could get even

336
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,940
worse so what could Donald Trump have

337
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,950
done after his drone had been knocked

338
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,050
down

339
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,190
on the one hand he could have made an

340
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,660
airstrike that this would have probably

341
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,700
ended with the loss of human lives and

342
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,530
see if then Iran had answered with

343
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,570
another airstrike some American soldiers

344
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,460
might have died and dear viewer if an

345
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,770
American died during this conflict Trump

346
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:18,870
would be almost forced to start a war

347
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,670
and now you might be wondering what does

348
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,620
America want a war here it's well it

349
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,839
would really make no sense whatsoever

350
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,360
first of all as we've seen Iran has a

351
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,790
really big and well-trained army and

352
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,350
we're talking about a country of 18

353
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,270
million people here this is twice as

354
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,700
many people as a in Iraq but not only

355
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,589
that do you really think anybody wants

356
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,450
to have a war at the strait of hormuz in

357
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,970
this case America and the rest of the

358
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,400
world has much more to lose than Iran at

359
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,230
the end of the day Iran cannot export

360
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,690
most of its oil and nobody wants such a

361
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:55,320
big spike in the market price of oil so

362
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,150
now the question goes to all of you do

363
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,339
you think that despite everything will

364
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,410
end up witnessing a war between America

365
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,900
and Iran do you think the Iran nuclear

366
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,060
sanctions were a good idea how would you

367
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,770
solve this problem well please leave
