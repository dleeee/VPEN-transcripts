2
00:00:07.46 --> 00:00:13.679
Japan a country that brags about two

3
00:00:10.8 --> 00:00:16.020
things the first is there used underwear

4
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.420
vending machines which yes you really

5
00:00:16.02 --> 00:00:20.490
can find on the street and the second is

6
00:00:18.42 --> 00:00:22.590
their integration rate which is by far

7
00:00:20.49 --> 00:00:24.539
the lowest in the developed world for

8
00:00:22.59 --> 00:00:27.359
comparison in the United States the

9
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.240
immigrant population is about 14% Canada

10
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.890
and New Zealand have 20 and 25%

11
00:00:29.24 --> 00:00:36.649
respectively and then this Japan with an

12
00:00:31.89 --> 00:00:36.649
immigration population of less than 2%

13
00:00:41.6 --> 00:00:46.400
so what's the reason for this well quite

14
00:00:44.48 --> 00:00:47.660
simply it's they're very restrictive

15
00:00:46.4 --> 00:00:49.940
immigration system

16
00:00:47.66 --> 00:00:51.980
this makes Japan something of a dream

17
00:00:49.94 --> 00:00:54.440
countries of politicians like Donald

18
00:00:51.98 --> 00:00:56.000
Trump all marine lepen if there is one

19
00:00:54.44 --> 00:00:58.150
word that could define the current

20
00:00:56.0 --> 00:01:00.380
political debate that word would be

21
00:00:58.15 --> 00:01:02.360
immigration in Europe countries are

22
00:01:00.38 --> 00:01:04.460
arguing about what to do with refugees

23
00:01:02.36 --> 00:01:06.290
and it seems the politicians across the

24
00:01:04.46 --> 00:01:08.120
board seem to think that immigration is

25
00:01:06.29 --> 00:01:09.590
the problem that needs to be stopped

26
00:01:08.12 --> 00:01:10.880
immigrations fallen under this

27
00:01:09.59 --> 00:01:14.119
government and we've cut net migration

28
00:01:10.88 --> 00:01:17.270
by 1/3 anyone who illegally crosses the

29
00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.020
border will be detained until they are

30
00:01:17.27 --> 00:01:24.050
removed out of our country and back to

31
00:01:21.02 --> 00:01:26.270
the country from which they came since I

32
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:30.080
took office we've deployed more border

33
00:01:26.27 --> 00:01:33.080
agents and technology to our southern

34
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:35.180
border than ever before so then Japan is

35
00:01:33.08 --> 00:01:36.740
a perfect example of what a country

36
00:01:35.18 --> 00:01:38.479
would look like without really many

37
00:01:36.74 --> 00:01:40.430
immigrants at all and so now you might

38
00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.899
be wondering what exactly does that mean

39
00:01:40.43 --> 00:01:43.640
for Japan's economy

40
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.530
do they really save money because they

41
00:01:43.64 --> 00:01:47.810
don't have to spend on social policies

42
00:01:45.53 --> 00:01:49.820
for immigrants further the Japanese

43
00:01:47.81 --> 00:01:51.320
workers enjoy a higher standard of life

44
00:01:49.82 --> 00:01:53.510
because they don't have to compete for

45
00:01:51.32 --> 00:01:55.550
jobs with foreign workers and on this

46
00:01:53.51 --> 00:01:57.500
episode of visuals politic we aren't

47
00:01:55.55 --> 00:01:59.450
going to be answering those questions

48
00:01:57.5 --> 00:02:01.549
but before we get into all of that we

49
00:01:59.45 --> 00:02:04.600
need to have a close look at Japan's

50
00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.780
immigration law

51
00:02:04.6 --> 00:02:10.460
one country one culture one brain this

52
00:02:08.78 --> 00:02:12.140
statement was said by the man who was

53
00:02:10.46 --> 00:02:13.160
the Prime Minister of Japan in the

54
00:02:12.14 --> 00:02:15.770
mid-1980s

55
00:02:13.16 --> 00:02:17.360
this man was Yasuhiro Nakasone a the

56
00:02:15.77 --> 00:02:19.550
statement clearly summarizes the

57
00:02:17.36 --> 00:02:21.620
immigration policy of Japan basically

58
00:02:19.55 --> 00:02:24.140
there are just two ways to get into the

59
00:02:21.62 --> 00:02:26.000
Land of the Rising Sun one is with a

60
00:02:24.14 --> 00:02:28.040
work contract and the other is with a

61
00:02:26.0 --> 00:02:30.290
tourist visa if a company wants to hire

62
00:02:28.04 --> 00:02:32.270
you from overseas you will need a work

63
00:02:30.29 --> 00:02:33.650
visa and the only possible way that you

64
00:02:32.27 --> 00:02:35.840
can get that visa is you have a

65
00:02:33.65 --> 00:02:37.610
university degree or have some specific

66
00:02:35.84 --> 00:02:40.160
skills that are practically impossible

67
00:02:37.61 --> 00:02:41.690
to find in the Japanese labor market so

68
00:02:40.16 --> 00:02:43.940
if you are just a construction worker

69
00:02:41.69 --> 00:02:46.790
you are never going to get a work permit

70
00:02:43.94 --> 00:02:48.650
for Japan that is unless you use this

71
00:02:46.79 --> 00:02:51.470
other program in Kaplan

72
00:02:48.65 --> 00:02:53.510
Kamala Pagnotta formally Japan didn't

73
00:02:51.47 --> 00:02:55.790
have a lot to accept workers from

74
00:02:53.51 --> 00:02:58.030
Moderation countries like Vietnam or

75
00:02:55.79 --> 00:03:00.830
Philippines they created the so-called

76
00:02:58.03 --> 00:03:03.230
technical and internal training program

77
00:03:00.83 --> 00:03:05.030
this in summary is sort of like being an

78
00:03:03.23 --> 00:03:07.070
intern in Japan except you get about

79
00:03:05.03 --> 00:03:09.019
half the salaries that a Japanese intern

80
00:03:07.07 --> 00:03:11.000
would get not only that but with this

81
00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.590
technical internal training program

82
00:03:11.0 --> 00:03:14.570
your boss is even allowed to hold on to

83
00:03:12.59 --> 00:03:15.170
your passport and access your bank

84
00:03:14.57 --> 00:03:17.150
account

85
00:03:15.17 --> 00:03:19.550
more worryingly than that since they

86
00:03:17.15 --> 00:03:21.560
started this program thousands of Asian

87
00:03:19.55 --> 00:03:25.489
immigrants have simply disappeared

88
00:03:21.56 --> 00:03:27.680
oh I forgot to show power source when

89
00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.290
the UN representative a spoke with me

90
00:03:27.68 --> 00:03:32.420
she said that my attitude was bad and

91
00:03:30.29 --> 00:03:35.570
that if I continue to have this heavy

92
00:03:32.42 --> 00:03:37.880
view if my actions continue her friend

93
00:03:35.57 --> 00:03:41.000
will hire a hitman to kill me crash I

94
00:03:37.88 --> 00:03:43.310
shall so well what if you enter with a

95
00:03:41.0 --> 00:03:45.080
tourist visa well in that case you can

96
00:03:43.31 --> 00:03:46.519
stand the country for a year and a half

97
00:03:45.08 --> 00:03:49.040
as long as you can prove that you are

98
00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.140
studying Japanese once that initial time

99
00:03:49.04 --> 00:03:53.030
is passed you need to get hired by a

100
00:03:51.14 --> 00:03:54.620
company this can lead to you getting a

101
00:03:53.03 --> 00:03:56.660
work visa but do watch out here because

102
00:03:54.62 --> 00:03:58.880
unlike in the United States or certain

103
00:03:56.66 --> 00:04:01.610
European countries this work visa

104
00:03:58.88 --> 00:04:03.650
stipulates what your profession is so

105
00:04:01.61 --> 00:04:05.959
for example if you get that work visa

106
00:04:03.65 --> 00:04:08.299
saying that you are a chef then you can

107
00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.680
only work in a restaurant if you break

108
00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.690
this rule and do some sort of other

109
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:13.370
works and the government will not renew

110
00:04:11.69 --> 00:04:14.930
your visa there is only one really

111
00:04:13.37 --> 00:04:15.930
effective way for a foreigner if you

112
00:04:14.93 --> 00:04:17.519
make a living in Japan

113
00:04:15.93 --> 00:04:20.160
Lumos tequila given a was like the

114
00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.440
easiest thing bleep here is marrying a

115
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:25.400
Japanese person now I hope you

116
00:04:22.44 --> 00:04:28.740
understand why in a country with over

117
00:04:25.4 --> 00:04:31.350
127 million inhabitants only 2 million

118
00:04:28.74 --> 00:04:33.330
of them immigrants but what consequences

119
00:04:31.35 --> 00:04:34.880
does this have on the daily lives of

120
00:04:33.33 --> 00:04:39.160
Japanese citizens

121
00:04:34.88 --> 00:04:39.160
[Music]

122
00:04:39.33 --> 00:04:45.250
parfaits is Japanese fashion Japan is

123
00:04:42.91 --> 00:04:46.600
the oldest country in the world not

124
00:04:45.25 --> 00:04:48.820
because of their long history but

125
00:04:46.6 --> 00:04:51.160
because of the actual physical age of

126
00:04:48.82 --> 00:04:53.020
their population in fact destination say

127
00:04:51.16 --> 00:04:55.570
this in the next 90 years they're going

128
00:04:53.02 --> 00:04:57.850
to lose about 44 million people from

129
00:04:55.57 --> 00:05:00.460
their population which is about the

130
00:04:57.85 --> 00:05:02.260
entire population of Canada now this

131
00:05:00.46 --> 00:05:04.720
wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for

132
00:05:02.26 --> 00:05:06.460
the Social Security system as you

133
00:05:04.72 --> 00:05:08.260
probably know the point as you know the

134
00:05:06.46 --> 00:05:09.880
pension system in most countries in the

135
00:05:08.26 --> 00:05:11.440
world works in the following way the

136
00:05:09.88 --> 00:05:13.060
people who are working today are the

137
00:05:11.44 --> 00:05:14.950
ones who are paying the pensions of the

138
00:05:13.06 --> 00:05:17.230
people who are retired today as the

139
00:05:14.95 --> 00:05:19.420
workforce gets smaller and smaller year

140
00:05:17.23 --> 00:05:21.490
after year the number of people paying

141
00:05:19.42 --> 00:05:23.620
those pensions is getting smaller

142
00:05:21.49 --> 00:05:25.300
further on the other side of things more

143
00:05:23.62 --> 00:05:27.790
and more people are retiring if you are

144
00:05:25.3 --> 00:05:32.220
drawing more and more social security

145
00:05:27.79 --> 00:05:32.220
and this leads to problems like this

146
00:05:32.76 --> 00:05:38.290
social security contributions cover only

147
00:05:35.92 --> 00:05:40.900
60 percent of these benefits the

148
00:05:38.29 --> 00:05:44.290
remaining 40 trillion yen comes from

149
00:05:40.9 --> 00:05:47.549
taxes or more precisely public deficits

by the way the music you're hearing in

152
00:05:50.19 --> 00:05:54.000
this video is from the Spanish bands

153

Matt Kalina if you like it and want to

00:05:54.0 --> 00:05:58.710
check out more of their stuff and do you

look in the description box

[Music]

157
00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.749
and this is why and pay attention to

158
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:12.259
this part Japan has the highest public

159
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:14.180
debt of any country in the world their

160
00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.029
current debt level is more than double

161
00:06:14.18 --> 00:06:18.529
their GDP and their fiscal deficit the

162
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:20.779
difference between their income and

163
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:23.089
their spending is higher than the one in

164
00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:25.189
the United States in other words if

165
00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:27.619
Angela Merkel were to go to Japan she'd

166
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.909
probably get very very angry so now you

167
00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:30.830
might be wondering well what does all of

168
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:33.649
this have to do with immigration well

169
00:06:30.83 --> 00:06:35.360
the answer is a lot you see we've all

170
00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:37.550
heard about how expensive it is to

171
00:06:35.36 --> 00:06:40.459
integrate immigrants you have to pay for

172
00:06:37.55 --> 00:06:42.619
social programs integration courses etc

173
00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:48.379
etc but no one really talks about how

174
00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:50.629
much a native citizen cost for example

175
00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.539
an American born citizen costs the

176
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:56.689
government 150 thousand dollars by the

177
00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.999
time they are age 16 and this is only

178
00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.499
for education and health care depending

179
00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:02.300
on the state that that person lives in

180
00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.830
you might have to add in other expenses

181
00:07:02.3 --> 00:07:05.389
but the government sees all of this as

182
00:07:03.83 --> 00:07:07.639
an investment because when that person

183
00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.529
starts paying taxes they're going to get

184
00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.879
that money back on the other hand let's

185
00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.919
take an example of a Vietnamese

186
00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.479
immigrants to Japan he comes to the

187
00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.550
country when he is old enough to start

188
00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:20.349
work his education and health care was

189
00:07:16.55 --> 00:07:20.349
already paid for by the Vietnamese

190
00:07:21.57 --> 00:07:25.680
and in an average of two years as

191
00:07:23.46 --> 00:07:27.600
Anthony's immigrant is going to find a

192
00:07:25.68 --> 00:07:29.610
job now of course that job might be a

193
00:07:27.6 --> 00:07:31.650
low page one and my page is the little

194
00:07:29.61 --> 00:07:34.080
tack that the Japanese government didn't

195
00:07:31.65 --> 00:07:36.330
have to invest any money into it so in

196
00:07:34.08 --> 00:07:38.520
other words immigrants are free cash for

197
00:07:36.33 --> 00:07:40.620
the government since Japan has so few

198
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:43.320
immigrants they are losing out on this

199
00:07:40.62 --> 00:07:46.080
easy influx of cash this is why in the

200
00:07:43.32 --> 00:07:48.270
middle of the fiscal crisis in 2015 the

201
00:07:46.08 --> 00:07:51.440
japanese prime minister shinzo are they

202
00:07:48.27 --> 00:07:51.440
made the following announced

203
00:07:55.4 --> 00:08:00.440
Japan and their pressure to accept more

204
00:07:58.22 --> 00:08:02.030
immigrants as workforce strength but

205
00:08:00.44 --> 00:08:04.040
despite what it looks like this is not

206
00:08:02.03 --> 00:08:06.850
just hands biggest problem Japan has

207
00:08:04.04 --> 00:08:09.470
seen the last 20 years go by with no

208
00:08:06.85 --> 00:08:11.960
economic growth this is what experts

209
00:08:09.47 --> 00:08:15.370
have called the lost decades and it has

210
00:08:11.96 --> 00:08:15.370
a lot to do with immigration as well

211
00:08:16.66 --> 00:08:21.440
concrete that is stopped innovating we

212
00:08:19.43 --> 00:08:23.870
all imagine Japan as a country of

213
00:08:21.44 --> 00:08:25.669
technology and innovation the country

214
00:08:23.87 --> 00:08:29.320
where companies like Nintendo Sony

215
00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:29.320
Toshiba where they were all born

216
00:08:30.1 --> 00:08:34.969
something less the reality is these

217
00:08:32.51 --> 00:08:37.909
companies are really old Nintendo was

218
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:40.909
founded in 1889 and Toyota was created

219
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.860
in 1937 actually can anybody name any

220
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.960
Japanese companies that were created in

221
00:08:42.86 --> 00:08:46.010
the 21st century you probably couldn't

222
00:08:44.96 --> 00:08:48.560
but on the other hand you could probably

223
00:08:46.01 --> 00:08:51.670
name five to ten American companies that

224
00:08:48.56 --> 00:08:51.670
were formed during the same period

225
00:08:54.41 --> 00:09:00.530
immigrant Ponder's service 52% of all

226
00:08:58.14 --> 00:09:04.710
new Silicon Valley companies between

227
00:09:00.53 --> 00:09:07.560
1995 and 2005 the entrepreneurial rate

228
00:09:04.71 --> 00:09:10.380
among immigrant populations is 2 to 3

229
00:09:07.56 --> 00:09:13.020
times higher than native and this is a

230
00:09:10.38 --> 00:09:14.520
trend that you find in every country for

231
00:09:13.02 --> 00:09:17.130
instance one of the founders of Google

232
00:09:14.52 --> 00:09:19.140
Sergey Brin was born in Moscow further

233
00:09:17.13 --> 00:09:25.260
the co-founder of whatsapp was born in

234
00:09:19.14 --> 00:09:27.300
Ukraine this isn't just about Silicon

235
00:09:25.26 --> 00:09:28.470
Valley startup just take a walk around

236
00:09:27.3 --> 00:09:30.780
your neighborhood and you'll see

237
00:09:28.47 --> 00:09:32.700
hundreds of Chinese stores Mexican

238
00:09:30.78 --> 00:09:35.400
restaurants and all of the kinds of

239
00:09:32.7 --> 00:09:37.110
small businesses created by immigrants

240
00:09:35.4 --> 00:09:39.060
and it does make complete sense that

241
00:09:37.11 --> 00:09:41.100
immigrants will have an entrepreneurial

242
00:09:39.06 --> 00:09:43.260
spirit at the end of the day those who

243
00:09:41.1 --> 00:09:45.420
leave their home country are risk takers

244
00:09:43.26 --> 00:09:47.700
not only that but immigrants bring

245
00:09:45.42 --> 00:09:49.890
wisdoms their culture to a new country

246
00:09:47.7 --> 00:09:54.780
which helps them in thinking outside of

247
00:09:49.89 --> 00:09:57.060
the box let's take a look as another

248
00:09:54.78 --> 00:09:58.920
example Charles Belmont was a German

249
00:09:57.06 --> 00:10:00.630
immigrants to New York City in the 19th

250
00:09:58.92 --> 00:10:02.520
century soon he realized that the

251
00:10:00.63 --> 00:10:04.589
workers in the city needed some sort of

252
00:10:02.52 --> 00:10:06.390
food that could be cooked and sold on

253
00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:08.400
the street that's when he decided to

254
00:10:06.39 --> 00:10:10.470
import sausages from his home country

255
00:10:08.4 --> 00:10:13.320
and that's when the hot dog was born

256
00:10:10.47 --> 00:10:15.810
today this meal feeds millions of people

257
00:10:13.32 --> 00:10:18.960
from all around the planet and this this

258
00:10:15.81 --> 00:10:21.480
is just one example there are thousands

259
00:10:18.96 --> 00:10:23.910
upon thousands more in short when

260
00:10:21.48 --> 00:10:26.400
cultures mix new ideas and methodologies

261
00:10:23.91 --> 00:10:29.640
are created this is what business people

262
00:10:26.4 --> 00:10:31.620
call innovation and this this is the

263
00:10:29.64 --> 00:10:34.310
special source that makes companies and

264
00:10:31.62 --> 00:10:34.310
countries

265
00:10:35.49 --> 00:10:39.899
so well what's going on in Japan

266
00:10:37.74 --> 00:10:41.860
unsurprisingly Japan has the lowest

267
00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:44.500
entrepreneurial rate in the developed

268
00:10:41.86 --> 00:10:46.540
world just 7% of the population decides

269
00:10:44.5 --> 00:10:47.709
to start a business by comparison in

270
00:10:46.54 --> 00:10:49.810
countries like Canada and New Zealand

271
00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:51.459
that percentage is about 10% the

272
00:10:49.81 --> 00:10:53.439
Japanese dream isn't to start your own

273
00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:55.420
business it's to get hired by one that

274
00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:56.740
already exists you know those big

275
00:10:55.42 --> 00:10:58.870
companies that we previously mentioned

276
00:10:56.74 --> 00:11:00.490
like Sony and Toshiba companies that

277
00:10:58.87 --> 00:11:04.709
have the same corporate and work

278
00:11:00.49 --> 00:11:04.709
structure that they had in the 1980s

279
00:11:06.06 --> 00:11:11.410
traditional Japanese electronic power

280
00:11:08.41 --> 00:11:14.319
houses such as sharp and Sony having

281
00:11:11.41 --> 00:11:14.769
Kurt huge losses and shed thousands of

282
00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:17.769
jobs

283
00:11:14.769 --> 00:11:20.350
welcome phasers Apple and Samsung have

284
00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:22.269
continued to increase their market share

285
00:11:20.35 --> 00:11:24.310
lately like football what Americans call

286
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:26.560
soccer why keep up with the World Cup or

287
00:11:24.31 --> 00:11:28.360
the USA championship 20 years ago there

288
00:11:26.56 --> 00:11:31.300
were at least two Japanese companies

289
00:11:28.36 --> 00:11:34.360
sponsoring these events in 2016 the

290
00:11:31.3 --> 00:11:36.160
European Cup had no Japanese sponsors

291
00:11:34.36 --> 00:11:38.589
and no matter where you look Japanese

292
00:11:36.16 --> 00:11:41.290
companies are struggling to compete with

293
00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:43.600
European American and even Chinese

294
00:11:41.29 --> 00:11:45.519
companies and the reason is not a lack

295
00:11:43.6 --> 00:11:48.069
of money it's a lack of innovation and

296
00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:52.680
this explains why Japan's economy has

297
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:52.680
been so frozen over the last decade

298
00:11:54.25 --> 00:11:59.270
and the course this is having a major

299
00:11:56.66 --> 00:12:01.010
impact on the lives of Japan citizens in

300
00:11:59.27 --> 00:12:03.320
order to keep productivity up Japanese

301
00:12:01.01 --> 00:12:05.540
workers have the longest working hours

302
00:12:03.32 --> 00:12:07.730
and the shortest holidays of any

303
00:12:05.54 --> 00:12:11.560
developed nation meanwhile they still

304
00:12:07.73 --> 00:12:11.560
have the same salaries that the parents

305
00:12:12.55 --> 00:12:16.730
so that is our opinion here at visual

306
00:12:15.23 --> 00:12:18.620
politic and now we would love to know

307
00:12:16.73 --> 00:12:20.330
yours do you think Japan should open its

308
00:12:18.62 --> 00:12:22.070
doors to immigrants or do you think

309
00:12:20.33 --> 00:12:24.320
other countries should follow Japan's

310
00:12:22.07 --> 00:12:26.120
example and close their doors to

311
00:12:24.32 --> 00:12:28.160
immigrants use the comment section below
