10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,430
isn't well known leader and he doesn't

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,350
run a state so much as a relatively

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,510
small country and officially he isn't

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,789
even that country's top leader despite

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,000
all this on june the second 2019 the new

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,070
york times published a report declaring

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,469
Mohammed bin Zayed as the most powerful

17
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,510
political leader in the arab world

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,250
he even ranks above the new de facto

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,590
Saudi Arabian leader Mohammed bin Salman

20
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,690
of whom we've already spoken about here

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,700
on visual politic of some links to those

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,649
videos in the description after their

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,149
New York Times report was published we

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,309
asked ourselves a few questions

25
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,289
who exactly is Mohammed bin Zayed what

26
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,059
are his keys to power is he really the

27
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,489
most powerful Arabic political leader in

28
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,190
the world well listen up

29
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,700
[Applause]

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,830
[Music]

31
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,420
Mohammed bin Zayed is the Crown Prince

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,070
of Abu Dhabi the richest and most

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,380
powerful emirate of the United Arab

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,220
Emirates

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,440
here's also the deputy supreme commander

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,090
of the Emirates Armed Forces and

37
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,100
presidents of the Abu Dhabi Executive

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,870
Council that is the presidents of the

39
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,060
Abu Dhabi government's quite a feat

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,369
and it's his political abilities along

41
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,140
with the poor health of his older

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,390
brother Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed that

43
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,200
have made him happy

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,810
Derby's de facto leader and by extension

45
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
the leader of all the United Arab

46
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,649
Emirates as you may know the United Arab

47
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,659
Emirates is a small country located in

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,610
the Persian Gulf and similar in size to

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,799
Panama or South Carolina we're talking

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,540
about a country made up of seven

51
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,549
different emirates out of which the two

52
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,369
best known by far are Abu Dhabi and

53
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,820
Dubai in fact even though this country

54
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,979
is made up of seven emirates the truth

55
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,380
is that at the political level abu dhabi

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,750
is by far the most important emirate

57
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,459
why what we're gonna see that later in

58
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,900
this video but we can already give you

59
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,030
quite a weighty reason Abu Dhabi holds

60
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,670
more than 90 percent of all the Arab

61
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,989
Emirates all reserves but for now let's

62
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,780
go back to Mohammed bin Zayed great

63
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,360
honor to have Sheikh Muhammad with us

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,319
today a man that I've known for special

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,569
for a special person highly respected

66
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,600
and loves his country I can tell you

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,850
that loves his country

68
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,040
[Music]

69
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,080
this character was born in 1961 and was

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
the third son of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,520
the first president of the United Arab

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,349
Emirates from a young age he focused his

73
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,360
career on the army where he became an

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,550
Air Force pilot and the Armed Forces is

75
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,080
where he also started his political

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,050
career in 1991 just after Saddam Hussein

77
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,420
initiated Iraq's invasion of Kuwait the

78
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,849
UN emirati air forces commander landed

79
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,860
in Washington with a mission to buy all

80
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,989
possible military equipment Hellfire

81
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,390
missiles Apache helicopters f-16 planes

82
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,700
they wanted the full package from that

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,680
moment on Mohammed bin Zayed became one

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,690
of Washington's closest allies not only

85
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,459
within the Arab countries but on the

86
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,410
entire planet because we're talking

87
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,910
about a political leader who over the

88
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,950
years has become one of the icons of

89
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,810
reform and openness in the Arab world

90
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,519
under his management Abu Dhabi has taken

91
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,470
pioneering steps both in Dubai's

92
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,900
economic and civil matters and on some

93
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,260
issues they went even further perhaps

94
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,120
the best proof of this is the Pope's own

95
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,100
visit to the Emirates which we recently

96
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,200
covered here on visual politic however

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,120
even though he was leading a reform

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,980
program that has made the Emirates

99
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,930
perhaps the most open and prosperous

100
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,269
country in the Arab world Mohammed bin

101
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,670
Zayed also fiercely supports an idea

102
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,680
that can sounds at the very least

103
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,840
controversial and that's that the Arab

104
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,850
world is not ready for democracy

105
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,289
according to bin zayed openness in the

106
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,479
Arab world can only come about to those

107
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,000
nations led by authoritarian regimes

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,039
promoting democracy would only feed

109
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,840
fundamentalist groups that would end up

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
winning the elections it's an idea that

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,830
is actively defended and as

112
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,539
significantly shaped the Emirates

113
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,940
external relations in recent years but

114
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,820
having said this I think we now have to

115
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,250
turn to the key question of this video

116
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,010
where does this character fit in and how

117
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,229
much power does he really have well as

118
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,270
examined the three main areas that form

119
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,770
the foundation of his power

120
00:04:52,770 --> 00:05:02,240
[Music]

121
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,559
the power of the portfolio I don't think

122
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,120
anyone will find it strange if I say

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,099
that money has always been one of the

124
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,379
most important elements in power

125
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,300
well if Arab countries have been famous

126
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,650
for anything it has been their

127
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,389
conspicuous consumption they are no

128
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,460
strangers to spending indecent amounts

129
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,949
of money on all kinds of things whims or

130
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,499
projects that lead nowhere well in this

131
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,180
case besides spending a lot of money on

132
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,039
all kinds of public projects what

133
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,499
Emirates have also done has been to save

134
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,029
and invest a good part of their money

135
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,189
all over the world

136
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:39,930
it got to the point that today Mohammed

137
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,550
bin Zayed has one of the fullest

138
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,499
portfolios we can imagine but the

139
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,089
question becomes exactly how much money

140
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:47,669
do the Emirates and Abu Dhabi have in

141
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,830
their sovereign wealth fund how much are

142
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,509
we really talking about here for those

143
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,490
who don't know a sovereign fund is an

144
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,689
investment fund that a government

145
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,029
creates to invest at savings and assets

146
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,409
in order to generate profitability

147
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:00,689
basically it's just like any savers

148
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:03,760
investment fund

149
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,080
well according to the latest estimates

150
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,449
the United Arab Emirates sovereign funds

151
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,310
have accumulated investments worth more

152
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,570
than 1.3 trillion dollars out of this

153
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,729
amounts just over 900 billion dollars

154
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,639
are concentrated in Abu Dhabi's two main

155
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,120
sovereign wealth funds having Darby's

156
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,790
investment authority controls almost 700

157
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,199
billion making it the third largest

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,389
sovereign wealth fund in the world and

159
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,030
MOBA Dollaz funds has just over 220

160
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,440
billion u.s. dollars we're talking about

161
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,199
an absolute fortune here more than 900

162
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,330
billion dollars saved by the emirate of

163
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,220
Abu Dhabi and invested throughout the

164
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,770
world in stocks debt buildings highways

165
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,320
ports airports banks hospitals hotels

166
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,050
factories mines even ice-cream parlors

167
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,479
in really everything and that explains

168
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,650
why you see news stories like these Abu

169
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,710
Dhabi pays a Bertie's 495 million

170
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,110
dollars for 20% of its Chilean

171
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,840
subsidiary Abu Dhabi Investment

172
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,210
Authority to invest 50 billion dollars

173
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,099
into India one of the largest sovereign

174
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,900
funds in the world the Abu Dhabi

175
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,210
Investment Authority will pour 50

176
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,400
billion dollars into India especially

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,860
into infrastructure and food processing

178
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,850
capacity

179
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,140
[Music]

180
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,520
but let's be careful here because power

181
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,320
doesn't only consist of having a full

182
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,780
portfolio but also of controlling assets

183
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,820
and companies of all kinds throughout

184
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,040
the entire worlds and to have a cash

185
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,470
flow that is very very coveted by most

186
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,240
governments who doesn't want a few

187
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,070
billion invested in their country I mean

188
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,610
it's just pure diplomacy

190
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,620
in any case there's a detail that we

191
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,480
can't skip you see the emirate of Abu

192
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,730
Dhabi only has a population of 2.7

193
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,950
million people out of which just over

194
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,260
half a million have Emirati nationality

195
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,060
that is the emirate of Abu Dhabi's

196
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,730
savings alone in its two main sovereign

197
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,020
firms announced more than three hundred

198
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,550
and forty thousand dollars per

199
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,430
inhabitant and more than 1.6 million per

200
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,130
citizen of Abu Dhabi with a Marathi

201
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,550
nationality they've been saving since

202
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,020
1976 and even though they're sitting on

203
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,880
such a large amount of money they take

204
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,990
the fact that the government doesn't

205
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,620
have a public deficit very seriously Abu

206
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,110
Dhabi to see a budget surplus in 2018

207
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,060
thanks to public consolidation efforts

208
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,890
but that is only only due to Mohammed

209
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,950
bin Zayed power

210
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,070

[Music]

212
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,710
the power of force this is perhaps the

213
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,810
Emirates least known aspect but in

214
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,490
recent years this small country has

215
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,770
earned itself the nickname little Sparta

216
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,020
the United Arab Emirates Army is very

217
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,720
small it has just over 60,000 soldiers

218
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,610
but in the last two decades under

219
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,950
Mohammed bin Zayed commands along with a

220
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,080
lot of experts among whom is the former

221
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,450
US Secretary of Defense Jim mattis this

222
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,640
army has been restructured around one

223
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,460
simple idea to be a small that very

224
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,680
well-equipped agile and well-trained

225
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,820
army to achieve this the Emirates

226
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,650
military budget exceeds 20 billion

227
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,450
dollars every year this has allowed them

228
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,120
to buy all kinds of foreign equipment 70

229
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,640
f-16s updated with the latest technology

230
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,220
more than 70 mirages 30 Apaches 19

231
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,040
Chinooks more than 400 Leclerc tanks 76

scorpions thousands of armored vehicles

233
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,610
of all kinds dozens of drones the

234
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,650
Patriot missile system they even bought

235
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,230
the crown jewel the fat missile system

236
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,850
one of the most modern systems in the

237
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,310
United States indeed it is the same one

238
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,170
that the US has deployed in South Korea

239
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,679
creating a huge confrontation with China

240
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,899
and this is just the beginning because

241
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,329
now they're looking at the f-35 in fact

242
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,949
after Saudi Arabia it's the second

243
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,379
largest buyer of technology and military

244
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,689
equipments from the United States but if

245
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:03,549
the Arab armies have traditionally been

246
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,079
known for something it has been for

247
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:06,789
spending a lot of money on equipments

248
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,009
and when the time comes not really

249
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,629
taking advantage of it that's why

250
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,879
another of Mohammed bin Zayed priorities

251
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,829
has been to ensure that the Emirati army

252
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:16,689
is well-trained Saudi think they went

253
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:17,780

256
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,620
well in addition to paying for all kinds

257
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,810
of training courses abroad the MRRT army

258
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,670
has committed itself to going into

259
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,230
combat in the last few years especially

260
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,000
hand-in-hand with the United States

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,110
itself since 2003 the emirate has

262
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,000
deployed elite troops in Afghanistan

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,040
sent troops to Somalia to combat piracy

264
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,680
and after the United States it is the

265
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,390
country that has carried out the most

266
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,040
air missions against the Islamic state

267
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,980
always hand in hand with the US and not

268
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,510
only that they have also recently

269
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,670
intervened on their own in Libya in

270
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,490
northern Sinai in Egypt and massively in

271
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,040
Yemen of course they've also had lots of

272
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,930
experts from around the world so much so

273
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,880
that some units are even under the

274
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,410
command of foreign officers in other

275
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,060
words they have contracted their own

276
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,290
officers this is the case for example of

277
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,060
general - Maher a former lieutenant

278
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,890
colonel of the United States Army who is

279
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,810
now in command of the Emirati helicopter

280
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,550
division North Australian Mike hen's

281
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,660
Maher shoot runs the presidential guard

282
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,370
the result is that today the Emirati

283
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,140
army is not only considered one of the

284
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,060
best equipped armies but also one of the

285
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,740
best trains throughout the region

286
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,060
they're catching up with Israel a

287
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,500
country which they're currently buying

288
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,210
technology from and that's not all in

289
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,560
another move to gain autonomy the

290
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,450
emirati authorities of reinstate of the

291
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,950
mandatory military service and have

292
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,660
invested a lot of money to develop a

293
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,310
full national weapons industry a

294
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,990
military industry all of its own of

295
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,460
course it's being done hand in hands

296
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,350
with large multinationals and their

297
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,910
technology and the truth is that it's

298
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,710
working

299
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,730

300
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,649

all manufactured in the Emirates now

305
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,130
they are even trying to develop their

306
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,350
own propeller bomber to operate at low

307
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,660
altitude on counterinsurgency missions

308
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,850
but wait there's more the emirate has

309
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,410
opens military bases in places like

310
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,079
Yemen Eritrea and Somalia lands which is

311
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,670
unprecedented and has prepared to

312
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,890
operate alongside mercenary armies elite

secretly sends Colombian mercenaries to

Yemen fight in short this is the change

319
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,360
that is taking place in the army and it

320
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,680
has earned them the nickname little

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,670

truth is that with such assets under

their belts no door remains closed and

344
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,459
if we add to all of this the fact that

345
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,350

00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:54,600
practically leading everything it

350
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,850
doesn't seem crazy to stage that today

351
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,769
he is the most powerful Arab political

352
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,240
leader in the world of course being the

353
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,040
most powerful Arab doesn't mean it's all

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,439
whenever I'm browsing on public Wi-Fi I

374
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,970
just have a VPN or running in the

375
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,529
background so I don't have to worry

376
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:45,689
about anyone stealing my data is just a

377
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,780
nice peace of mind

378
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,730
but it's not just about security you can

379
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,500
also use it to change the country that

380
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,760
you appear to be in so you can get

381
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,500
content that might normally only

382
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,900
available in specific geographic

383
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,820
locations Nord VPN is super fast so

384
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,920
watching video is a breeze there's no

385
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,940
lag whatsoever

386
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,800
if you've used VPNs in the past and

387
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,900
thought they were really slow on No More

388
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,620
with an awed VPN and you can use it on

389
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,870
all of your devices very easily Android

390
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,540

394
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,880

heard about the Nord breach in the news

400

recently but it's important to point out

401
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,540
that no user information was exposed in

402
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,280
this breach because Nord VPN doesn't

403
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,710
keep any logs on its servers because it

404
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,780
doesn't keep any logs at all it's based

405
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,790
out of Panama so it doesn't have to

406
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,950
however Nord VPN are still moving to a

407
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,980
