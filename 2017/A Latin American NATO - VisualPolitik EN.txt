[Music]

3
00:00:07.61 --> 00:00:13.720
Latin America is perhaps the region with

4
00:00:10.23 --> 00:00:19.220
the least military ambition in the world

5
00:00:13.72 --> 00:00:21.900
[Music]

6
00:00:19.22 --> 00:00:23.550
the government spends relatively little

7
00:00:21.9 --> 00:00:25.289
on defense and in general with some

8
00:00:23.55 --> 00:00:28.130
exceptions creating large and powerful

9
00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.940
armies is not exactly a priority

[Music]

11
00:00:30.94 --> 00:00:35.830
just like this the subject of the Armed

12
00:00:33.85 --> 00:00:38.020
Forces has been very controversial in

13
00:00:35.83 --> 00:00:39.850
the region in recent years and there's

14
00:00:38.02 --> 00:00:42.580
no wonder because the second half of the

15
00:00:39.85 --> 00:00:44.470
20th century wasn't exactly a quiet time

16
00:00:42.58 --> 00:00:46.500
for Latin America throughout this period

17
00:00:44.47 --> 00:00:49.210
and especially in the 1960s and 1970s

18
00:00:46.5 --> 00:00:51.400
this region was one of the territories

19
00:00:49.21 --> 00:00:53.760
in the world which was the most affected

20
00:00:51.4 --> 00:00:57.530
by military force

21
00:00:53.76 --> 00:01:01.230

[Music]

26
00:01:23.03 --> 00:01:27.030
for these years practically every

27
00:01:25.29 --> 00:01:29.220
country in the region participated in

28
00:01:27.03 --> 00:01:31.470
what kind of became a macabre tradition

29
00:01:29.22 --> 00:01:33.690
of Coos military groups and of course

30
00:01:31.47 --> 00:01:36.180
plenty of repression for example let's

31
00:01:33.69 --> 00:01:42.079
take a look at 1978

32
00:01:36.18 --> 00:01:42.079

Salvador Panama and even the peaceful

41
00:02:12.8 --> 00:02:16.310
Uruguay were under a military

42
00:02:14.24 --> 00:02:18.290
dictatorship and do forgive me if I left

43
00:02:16.31 --> 00:02:20.960
anything out because I see it's a pretty

44
00:02:18.29 --> 00:02:23.990
long list dictators of every kind

45
00:02:20.96 --> 00:02:26.710
existed left-right pro-us anti-us harder

46
00:02:23.99 --> 00:02:31.540
softer but well they all have one common

47
00:02:26.71 --> 00:02:31.540
elements and that was repression

48
00:02:32.63 --> 00:02:36.390
yeah in the framework of the Cold War

49
00:02:35.01 --> 00:02:38.430
and bloc struggles many of these

50
00:02:36.39 --> 00:02:40.410
dictatorships they were supported by the

51
00:02:38.43 --> 00:02:42.780
United States under the framework of

52
00:02:40.41 --> 00:02:44.460
what was later known as Operation Condor

53
00:02:42.78 --> 00:02:46.410
a sinister intelligence collaboration

54
00:02:44.46 --> 00:02:48.360
plan forged between the military

55
00:02:46.41 --> 00:02:50.850
dictatorships of Adela's Argentina

60
00:02:56.79 --> 00:03:01.290
the CIA in order to achieve a single

00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:03.120
objective persecute and annihilate the

62
00:03:01.29 --> 00:03:04.920
political opposition especially the

63
00:03:03.12 --> 00:03:09.000
leftist groups that were supported by

64
00:03:04.92 --> 00:03:10.950
the Soviet regime and of course as you

65
00:03:09.0 --> 00:03:12.510
might expect the dictatorships forged

66
00:03:10.95 --> 00:03:15.470
under the other political color they

67
00:03:12.51 --> 00:03:17.340
weren't any better not at all in fact

68
00:03:15.47 --> 00:03:19.560
considering this it isn't hard to

69
00:03:17.34 --> 00:03:22.290
imagine why the Armed Forces issue has

70
00:03:19.56 --> 00:03:24.240
been so controversial well more than 30

71
00:03:22.29 --> 00:03:26.070
years have now passed since this dark

72
00:03:24.24 --> 00:03:28.170
period and in this video we're going to

73
00:03:26.07 --> 00:03:30.240
be answering several questions what is

74
00:03:28.17 --> 00:03:31.920
the current state of Latin America's

75
00:03:30.24 --> 00:03:33.960
armies what functions do they really

76
00:03:31.92 --> 00:03:36.000
have and do they pose any risks to the

77
00:03:33.96 --> 00:03:43.500
democracy and freedom of these countries

78
00:03:36.0 --> 00:03:47.100
well let's dive in armies in Latin

79
00:03:43.5 --> 00:03:48.959
America before we begin and just out of

80
00:03:47.1 --> 00:03:51.000
curiosity well let me ask you a question

81
00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.410
which do you think are the strongest

82
00:03:51.0 --> 00:03:56.670
most powerful armies in Latin America

83
00:03:54.41 --> 00:03:58.739
well this is always quite subjective but

84
00:03:56.67 --> 00:04:00.930
according to the global firepower index

85
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.610
from 2017 which is an indicator that

86
00:04:00.93 --> 00:04:03.810
attempts to measure which armies are

87
00:04:02.61 --> 00:04:06.120
more powerful and to different

88
00:04:03.81 --> 00:04:07.769
parameters these are the top five in

89
00:04:06.12 --> 00:04:09.630
Latin America first place Noorie

90
00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.670
surprising it goes to Brazil which is

91
00:04:09.63 --> 00:04:13.560
the greatest regional power this is

92
00:04:11.67 --> 00:04:18.000
followed by in this order Mexico

93
00:04:13.56 --> 00:04:20.010
Argentina Peru and Colombia the truth is

94
00:04:18.0 --> 00:04:21.959
that Latin America is the region with

95
00:04:20.01 --> 00:04:25.260
the smallest of budget dedicated to

96
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.660
defense in 2016 it was just over 1% of

97
00:04:25.26 --> 00:04:30.180
its GDP which is about a sixty seven

98
00:04:27.66 --> 00:04:31.500
billion dollars this expenditure is much

99
00:04:30.18 --> 00:04:33.510
lower than the global average

100
00:04:31.5 --> 00:04:35.520
especially because Latin American armies

101
00:04:33.51 --> 00:04:36.290
tend to have a quite a high number of

102
00:04:35.52 --> 00:04:40.590
soldiers

103
00:04:36.29 --> 00:04:43.420
[Music]

104
00:04:40.59 --> 00:04:46.240
to get an idea in total the region has

105
00:04:43.42 --> 00:04:48.880
over 1.7 3 million soldiers and of

106
00:04:46.24 --> 00:04:51.130
course the combination of a low budget

107
00:04:48.88 --> 00:04:53.380
with many soldiers needs two outdated

108
00:04:51.13 --> 00:04:55.270
armies with plenty of operational

109
00:04:53.38 --> 00:04:59.980
problems let's take a look at the most

110
00:04:55.27 --> 00:05:01.780
important army the brazilian army brazil

111
00:04:59.98 --> 00:05:03.790
spends twenty three point seven billion

112
00:05:01.78 --> 00:05:05.890
dollars every year which kind of on the

113
00:05:03.79 --> 00:05:07.450
face of it seems like quite a lot right

114
00:05:05.89 --> 00:05:09.310
well the problem is that the army has

115
00:05:07.45 --> 00:05:11.440
three hundred and forty thousand

116
00:05:09.31 --> 00:05:13.480
soldiers which means that three-quarters

117
00:05:11.44 --> 00:05:15.640
of the budget goes to salaries and to

118
00:05:13.48 --> 00:05:17.500
pensions if to this we add basic

119
00:05:15.64 --> 00:05:24.760
supplies then the money left for

120
00:05:17.5 --> 00:05:26.710
equipment is very very low and in the

121
00:05:24.76 --> 00:05:28.840
rest of Latin America ratio is a similar

122
00:05:26.71 --> 00:05:34.810
on average 70% of the money goes

123
00:05:28.84 --> 00:05:36.640
directly to salaries in other words

124
00:05:34.81 --> 00:05:40.890
Latin American armies usually have a lot

125
00:05:36.64 --> 00:05:40.890
of soldiers and very little equipment

126
00:05:48.19 --> 00:05:54.550
looking inwards so if we talk about

127
00:05:52.99 --> 00:05:56.320
armies wars and conflicts between

128
00:05:54.55 --> 00:05:57.790
countries we could say that Latin

129
00:05:56.32 --> 00:06:00.220
America is one of the most peaceful

130
00:05:57.79 --> 00:06:02.320
regions in the world the last armed

131
00:06:00.22 --> 00:06:05.440
conflict occurred in 1995 and what was

132
00:06:02.32 --> 00:06:07.840
later known as the synapomorphy dorans

133
00:06:05.44 --> 00:06:14.410
Peru but no formal declaration of war

134
00:06:07.84 --> 00:06:16.570
was ever made since then the trend has

135
00:06:14.41 --> 00:06:18.550
begun that has made Latin America a

136
00:06:16.57 --> 00:06:20.140
benchmark every time there is a conflict

137
00:06:18.55 --> 00:06:21.910
between two countries instead of

138
00:06:20.14 --> 00:06:23.950
threatening each other with bombs and

139
00:06:21.91 --> 00:06:25.990
cannons those involved resorts to

140
00:06:23.95 --> 00:06:27.820
international justice this is what is

141
00:06:25.99 --> 00:06:29.980
currently happening for example with the

142
00:06:27.82 --> 00:06:31.690
conflicts between Bolivia and Chile over

143
00:06:29.98 --> 00:06:33.280
the sea fronts may conflict that is

144
00:06:31.69 --> 00:06:36.100
being resolved at the International

145
00:06:33.28 --> 00:06:38.350
Court of Justice in The Hague Bolivia

146
00:06:36.1 --> 00:06:40.950
replies to the lawsuit against Chile at

147
00:06:38.35 --> 00:06:43.300
The Hague Court for sea access however

148
00:06:40.95 --> 00:06:44.860
internally well things they are

149
00:06:43.3 --> 00:06:46.540
completely different we could say that

150
00:06:44.86 --> 00:06:48.910
Latin America has the record for being

151
00:06:46.54 --> 00:06:51.360
the most peaceful region and at the same

152
00:06:48.91 --> 00:06:53.790
time the most violence once

153
00:06:51.36 --> 00:06:55.200
[Music]

154
00:06:53.79 --> 00:06:57.300
what I mean here is that between

155
00:06:55.2 --> 00:06:59.580
countries there is no serious threat of

156
00:06:57.3 --> 00:07:01.770
war but the situation is different if we

157
00:06:59.58 --> 00:07:03.270
talk about internal violence more

158
00:07:01.77 --> 00:07:05.670
incredible than that though is the fact

159
00:07:03.27 --> 00:07:08.850
that one in three homicides that occur

160
00:07:05.67 --> 00:07:10.410
every year globally take place in Latin

161
00:07:08.85 --> 00:07:12.690
America so because apparently all

162
00:07:10.41 --> 00:07:15.240
enemies are at home Latin American

163
00:07:12.69 --> 00:07:17.070
military forces focus on at home tasks

164
00:07:15.24 --> 00:07:18.450
such as confronting guerillas drug

165
00:07:17.07 --> 00:07:20.400
traffickers or just dealing with

166
00:07:18.45 --> 00:07:21.390
violence in general in fact in the

167
00:07:20.4 --> 00:07:23.760
region it is becoming increasingly

168
00:07:21.39 --> 00:07:25.710
common for military forces to replace

169
00:07:23.76 --> 00:07:27.840
the police in security and surveillance

170
00:07:25.71 --> 00:07:29.910
tasks the paalam him is that evidence

171
00:07:27.84 --> 00:07:32.980
shows that soldiers aren't really good

172
00:07:29.91 --> 00:07:36.200
at playing the role of the police

173
00:07:32.98 --> 00:07:40.580
[Music]

174

first crime rates in Brazil or Mexico

177
00:07:43.88 --> 00:07:49.220
far from decreasing have increased since

[Music]

185
00:08:04.23 --> 00:08:09.090
power abuse extrajudicial detentions or

186
00:08:07.26 --> 00:08:10.800
collateral victims have also increased

187
00:08:09.09 --> 00:08:12.990
with military presence which further

188
00:08:10.8 --> 00:08:15.120
favors and feeds a culture of violence

189
00:08:12.99 --> 00:08:16.740
this is something that is unfortunately

190
00:08:15.12 --> 00:08:19.220
far too widespread in the region

191
00:08:16.74 --> 00:08:19.220
nowadays

192
00:08:21.14 --> 00:08:25.790
the thing is that soldiers are forces

193
00:08:23.78 --> 00:08:28.220
trained for war in order to eliminate

194
00:08:25.79 --> 00:08:29.960
the enemy not to impose order and the

rule of law to achieve rule of law what

local police forces and even citizen

collaboration not the military we can

199
00:08:35.87 --> 00:08:40.590
take a look at what has happened for

200
00:08:37.4 --> 00:08:43.080
example in Mexico

201
00:08:40.59 --> 00:08:45.030
[Music]

202
00:08:43.08 --> 00:08:47.790
as soon as he became president in

203
00:08:45.03 --> 00:08:49.740
December 2006 Felipe Calderon declared

204
00:08:47.79 --> 00:08:51.630
war on drugs and placed the army on the

205
00:08:49.74 --> 00:08:53.880
streets since then not only has

206
00:08:51.63 --> 00:08:56.700
narcotics trafficking not decreased but

207
00:08:53.88 --> 00:08:58.440
homicide rates of triples the army it's

208
00:08:56.7 --> 00:09:00.810
simply not enough they can of course

209
00:08:58.44 --> 00:09:02.520
lend a hand in very serious cases but

210
00:09:00.81 --> 00:09:04.470
they cannot be a police force it just

211
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:06.090
doesn't work and yes I do know that

212
00:09:04.47 --> 00:09:08.160
corruption in the police is a problem

213
00:09:06.09 --> 00:09:09.900
but this isn't simply fixed by resorting

214
00:09:08.16 --> 00:09:11.610
to using the army and indeed this

215
00:09:09.9 --> 00:09:13.860
actually leads to two other major

216
00:09:11.61 --> 00:09:16.650
problems the first one is political risk

217
00:09:13.86 --> 00:09:18.990
so consider this Madden America's armed

218
00:09:16.65 --> 00:09:21.000
forces must be anti-imperialist Evo

219
00:09:18.99 --> 00:09:23.010
Morales well what do you want me to say

220
00:09:21.0 --> 00:09:24.930
to me seeing politicians use military

221
00:09:23.01 --> 00:09:27.540
forces to defend their political ideas

222
00:09:24.93 --> 00:09:29.850
whatever they might be seems very very

223
00:09:27.54 --> 00:09:31.890
dangerous using that power of force is

224
00:09:29.85 --> 00:09:33.390
always going to be super tempting this

225
00:09:31.89 --> 00:09:35.010
is what has happened for example in

226
00:09:33.39 --> 00:09:36.390
Venezuela where the armed forces have

227
00:09:35.01 --> 00:09:38.640
pretty much become something like a

228
00:09:36.39 --> 00:09:40.170
Praetorian Guard for Nicolas Maduro as

229
00:09:38.64 --> 00:09:43.270
Bolivarian regime

[Music]

231
00:09:43.27 --> 00:09:47.920
and if that wasn't enough there is also

232
00:09:45.73 --> 00:09:50.170
the big corruption problem see the

233
00:09:47.92 --> 00:09:52.360
military industry is really opaque and

234
00:09:50.17 --> 00:09:54.520
it's got huge contracts which are two

235
00:09:52.36 --> 00:09:56.800
pretty basic ingredients for corruption

236
00:09:54.52 --> 00:09:59.920
just have a look what happens in 2010 in

237
00:09:56.8 --> 00:10:01.420
the dominican republic in 2010 a major

238
00:09:59.92 --> 00:10:02.920
corruption scandal affected the

239
00:10:01.42 --> 00:10:04.870
dominican armed forces due to the

240
00:10:02.92 --> 00:10:05.350
fraudulent purchase of eight super

241
00:10:04.87 --> 00:10:07.450
tucano

242
00:10:05.35 --> 00:10:09.850
as aircraft from the brazilian company

243
00:10:07.45 --> 00:10:11.890
Embraer it is suspected that 87 million

244
00:10:09.85 --> 00:10:13.330
dollars remained in the hands of members

245
00:10:11.89 --> 00:10:16.120
of the country's political and military

246
00:10:13.33 --> 00:10:18.160
hierarchy Lilian babay a professor at

247
00:10:16.12 --> 00:10:20.380
Bentley University in Massachusetts and

248
00:10:18.16 --> 00:10:22.510
that's just one example and it's not

249
00:10:20.38 --> 00:10:24.310
even the most important one so taking

250
00:10:22.51 --> 00:10:26.380
all of this into account maybe it would

251
00:10:24.31 --> 00:10:29.580
be a good idea to consider some sort of

252
00:10:26.38 --> 00:10:29.580
military alliance

253
00:10:30.52 --> 00:10:33.610
[Music]

254
00:10:35.68 --> 00:10:43.270
a latin-american NATO now allow me to

255
00:10:41.02 --> 00:10:45.339
propose an idea that may seem just the

256
00:10:43.27 --> 00:10:47.410
touch crazy now based on what we've just

257
00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:49.270
discussed wouldn't it be a good idea to

258
00:10:47.41 --> 00:10:51.220
think about building a great military

259
00:10:49.27 --> 00:10:52.839
alliance an alliance in which different

260
00:10:51.22 --> 00:10:55.149
countries could organize and provide

261
00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:57.459
different units and bodies for different

262
00:10:55.149 --> 00:11:01.330
types of tasks this would have several

263
00:10:57.459 --> 00:11:02.980
major advantages the one military

264
00:11:01.33 --> 00:11:04.600
influence over political power would

265
00:11:02.98 --> 00:11:06.580
decrease and sovereignty would be

266
00:11:04.6 --> 00:11:08.440
guaranteed for all countries in addition

267
00:11:06.58 --> 00:11:10.480
and if necessary during natural

268
00:11:08.44 --> 00:11:12.310
disasters Latin American countries could

269
00:11:10.48 --> 00:11:13.510
have an army that could deploy rapidly

270
00:11:12.31 --> 00:11:15.850
where they are needed

271
00:11:13.51 --> 00:11:17.589
it could also push for much-needed Latin

272
00:11:15.85 --> 00:11:19.270
American integration and to increase

273
00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:20.550
this region's role in the world of

274
00:11:19.27 --> 00:11:23.670
politics

00:11:20.55 --> 00:11:23.670
[Music]

276
00:11:26.4 --> 00:11:30.970
but above all it would free many

277
00:11:28.63 --> 00:11:32.650
resources both economic and human and

278
00:11:30.97 --> 00:11:34.780
this could be used to promote citizen

279
00:11:32.65 --> 00:11:39.040
security and reduce violence rates in

280
00:11:34.78 --> 00:11:40.360
these countries in a way the European

281
00:11:39.04 --> 00:11:42.220
Union they're actually trying to do

282
00:11:40.36 --> 00:11:43.780
something similar so while it may sound

283
00:11:42.22 --> 00:11:45.700
like a bit of a crazy idea at first

284
00:11:43.78 --> 00:11:47.530
maybe it's not like crazy after all

285
00:11:45.7 --> 00:11:49.330
for example Costa Rica suppressed its

286
00:11:47.53 --> 00:11:51.250
army decades ago and the results in

287
00:11:49.33 --> 00:11:53.050
terms of security have been better than

288
00:11:51.25 --> 00:11:54.940
those of its neighbors we've said before

289
00:11:53.05 --> 00:11:56.980
here on visual politic that the 21st

290
00:11:54.94 --> 00:11:59.440

293

soldiers can be used to replace the
