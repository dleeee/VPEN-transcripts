[Music]

3
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.509
it's no secret Israel and the Arabic

4
00:00:10.8 --> 00:00:15.179
countries have never had a good

5
00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.000
relationship in fact they've always had

6
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.550
a pretty terrible one three Wars dozens

7
00:00:18.0 --> 00:00:24.960
of diplomatic conflicts and all kinds of

8
00:00:20.55 --> 00:00:26.789
accusations the arab-israeli conflict

9
00:00:24.96 --> 00:00:28.769
was one of the hottest in the second

10
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.269
half of the 20th century so when you

11
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.949
have problems with your neighbors well

12
00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.110
you have a problem but if your neighbors

13
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.510
are the largest oil producers in the

14
00:00:34.11 --> 00:00:38.280
world well then you really have a much

15
00:00:36.51 --> 00:00:40.290
bigger problem this is especially true

16
00:00:38.28 --> 00:00:42.510
when you consider that Israel has always

17
00:00:40.29 --> 00:00:44.940
been considered something of an energy

18
00:00:42.51 --> 00:00:46.260
wasteland all attempts to find oil there

19
00:00:44.94 --> 00:00:48.180
were Mun successful

20
00:00:46.26 --> 00:00:50.760
now it is true that having told 1979

21
00:00:48.18 --> 00:00:52.620
Israel has a nice ally in the region can

22
00:00:50.76 --> 00:00:54.510
you guess which country this was well

23
00:00:52.62 --> 00:00:57.270
you might be surprised to learn but it

24
00:00:54.51 --> 00:00:59.309
was Iran yes that's right in the times

25
00:00:57.27 --> 00:01:01.920
of the charr of Persia Iran was a close

26
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.199
ally of Israel after all they both had a

27
00:01:01.92 --> 00:01:06.210
common enemy and that once the Arabic

28
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
countries for the first time we see the

29
00:01:06.21 --> 00:01:09.540
new Shia arriving a tournament house to

30
00:01:08.1 --> 00:01:11.520
take over the reins of office in

31
00:01:09.54 --> 00:01:13.049
succession to his abdicated father these

32
00:01:11.52 --> 00:01:15.450
countries had such a close relationship

33
00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.610
that in 1978 Israel offered the Shah of

34
00:01:15.45 --> 00:01:20.549
Persia helping building nuclear power

35
00:01:17.61 --> 00:01:22.590
plants yes really however that all

36
00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.630
changed in 1979 with Canadians

37
00:01:22.59 --> 00:01:26.700
revolution from that moment on Israel

38
00:01:24.63 --> 00:01:30.140
and Iran went from being good friends

39
00:01:26.7 --> 00:01:30.140
p-well great enemy

40
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.329
the thing is that Israel has always had

41
00:01:33.75 --> 00:01:37.979
two main weaknesses the first is its bad

42
00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.020
relations with countries in the region

43
00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.210
and the second are the difficulties

44
00:01:40.02 --> 00:01:44.640
they've had ensuring their oil supply

45
00:01:42.21 --> 00:01:46.409
especially when facing conflicts the

46
00:01:44.64 --> 00:01:47.759
Minister for energy in Israel admitted

47
00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.819
in 2014

48
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.530
Israel's situation is complicated you

49
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.209
don't have diplomatic relations with

50
00:01:52.53 --> 00:01:57.479
most of the countries from which we

51
00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.880
import oil Yosef baretsky however it

52
00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:08.340
seems as if all of this it's about to

53
00:01:59.88 --> 00:02:10.739
change God's gift comes gift that is the

54
00:02:08.34 --> 00:02:12.390
definition Benjamin Netanyahu Israel's

55
00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.130
prime minister gave to the latest

56
00:02:12.39 --> 00:02:15.540
discoveries made in the Mediterranean

57
00:02:14.13 --> 00:02:17.670
Sea discoveries which might change

58
00:02:15.54 --> 00:02:22.860
forever the strategic reality of the

59
00:02:17.67 --> 00:02:24.750
conflict region of the Middle East but

60
00:02:22.86 --> 00:02:27.180
now you are probably wondering what

61
00:02:24.75 --> 00:02:29.730
might those discoveries be well pay

62
00:02:27.18 --> 00:02:31.920
attention to this map each yellow piece

63
00:02:29.73 --> 00:02:36.420
represents a newly discovered natural

64
00:02:31.92 --> 00:02:38.069
gas field and these are not small fields

65
00:02:36.42 --> 00:02:39.930
either the last of them to be found and

66
00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.239
known as in lab arson is one of the

67
00:02:39.93 --> 00:02:47.549
largest reserves found in the last few

68
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:50.250
decades Israel has done everything they

69
00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.109
could since 1952 in order to find oil or

70
00:02:50.25 --> 00:02:53.880
gas in their territory so that they

71
00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.889
could achieve energy independence but

72
00:02:53.88 --> 00:02:58.769
unand over year 2000 all of their

73
00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.720
attempts they were unsuccessful if you

74
00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.730
were talking ten years ago 15 years ago

75
00:03:00.72 --> 00:03:04.560
and I said Israel would find a big

76
00:03:02.73 --> 00:03:06.780
amount of energy and be almost totally

77
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:08.250
independent when it comes to energy you

78
00:03:06.78 --> 00:03:09.870
would think that I am crazy

79
00:03:08.25 --> 00:03:12.180
we were the country of milk and honey

80
00:03:09.87 --> 00:03:15.299
but when it came to oil we left it to

81
00:03:12.18 --> 00:03:17.190
our neighbors nati bierenbaum thomas

82
00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.959
group however everything started to

83
00:03:17.19 --> 00:03:21.299
change in the year 2000 thanks to

84
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.400
technology when a Texan company Noble

85
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.549
Energy founds the first reserves in the

86
00:03:23.4 --> 00:03:27.810
open sea known as Mari B this first one

87
00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.450
it was small that it was a turning point

88
00:03:27.81 --> 00:03:33.120
because they knew that under the sea on

89
00:03:30.45 --> 00:03:35.160
the seabed there were surprises waiting

90
00:03:33.12 --> 00:03:37.349
so noble energy kept exploring the

91
00:03:35.16 --> 00:03:39.799
bottom of the sea and in 2009 they hit

92
00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.799
the jackpot

93
00:03:42.9 --> 00:03:48.610
they found that the Tamar reserves shoe

94
00:03:45.94 --> 00:03:50.409
size was significant in fact the reserve

95
00:03:48.61 --> 00:03:52.870
provides Israel with half of their

96
00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.209
electricity requirements us a year later

97
00:03:52.87 --> 00:03:57.250
in 2010 well they didn't just hit the

98
00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.060
jackpot in the casinos they won the

99
00:03:57.25 --> 00:03:59.560
lottery

100
00:03:58.06 --> 00:04:01.299
after spending only one hundred million

101
00:03:59.56 --> 00:04:04.480
dollars in the exploration of the area

102
00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.640
mobile energy is Leviathan an enormous

103
00:04:04.48 --> 00:04:08.829
field so now you're probably starting to

104
00:04:06.64 --> 00:04:11.110
understand what's going on here a little

105
00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.239
better it is estimated that this reserve

106
00:04:11.11 --> 00:04:16.019
is larger than all of the ones found in

107
00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.310
countries like Bolivia or Mexico and

108
00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.199
well this is not the end of the story

109
00:04:18.31 --> 00:04:21.010
because most of this area is still

110
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.630
unexplored

111
00:04:21.01 --> 00:04:24.070
in fact geological studies have

112
00:04:22.63 --> 00:04:26.560
indicated that there is much more

113
00:04:24.07 --> 00:04:28.960
natural gas 5,000 meters below the

114
00:04:26.56 --> 00:04:30.520
surface oh and there is also

115
00:04:28.96 --> 00:04:32.410
oil moreover the government estimates

116
00:04:30.52 --> 00:04:34.750
that the Mediterranean could be holding

117
00:04:32.41 --> 00:04:37.240
a colossal wealth in natural gas and oil

118
00:04:34.75 --> 00:04:40.060
and well this force within Israeli

119
00:04:37.24 --> 00:04:41.530
waters in total the government estimates

120
00:04:40.06 --> 00:04:43.720
that there might be more than three

121
00:04:41.53 --> 00:04:47.229
trillion cubic meters of gas and six

122
00:04:43.72 --> 00:04:49.180
billion barrels of oil all right that's

123
00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.400
all well and good but what exactly is 3

124
00:04:49.18 --> 00:04:53.530
trillion cubic meters I mean it's not

125
00:04:51.4 --> 00:04:55.270
exactly easy to picture so you can

126
00:04:53.53 --> 00:04:57.729
appreciate the size of this if these

127
00:04:55.27 --> 00:04:59.530
estimations are right Israel a small

128
00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.479
country is only around 80 million

129
00:04:59.53 --> 00:05:03.520
inhabitants could become one of the top

130
00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.280
15 countries when it comes to natural

131
00:05:03.52 --> 00:05:07.440
gas reserves and in the top 20 countries

132
00:05:06.28 --> 00:05:15.110
when it comes to oil

133
00:05:07.44 --> 00:05:15.110
[Music]

134
00:05:15.74 --> 00:05:21.060
and this is not just for Israel exports

135
00:05:19.17 --> 00:05:23.280
they've already started at the end of

136
00:05:21.06 --> 00:05:24.600
2016 Israeli companies reached an

137
00:05:23.28 --> 00:05:26.550
agreement with the government of Jordan

138
00:05:24.6 --> 00:05:28.980
to become its main supplier for the next

139
00:05:26.55 --> 00:05:32.130
15 years it's a contract worth more than

140
00:05:28.98 --> 00:05:33.780
ten billion dollars between 50 and 60

141
00:05:32.13 --> 00:05:36.090
percent of that money is going straight

142
00:05:33.78 --> 00:05:37.530
to the coffers of the Israeli government

143
00:05:36.09 --> 00:05:39.000
that's right division politics here in

144
00:05:37.53 --> 00:05:41.040
the next few decades the government of

145
00:05:39.0 --> 00:05:42.990
Israel is going to get an income in the

146
00:05:41.04 --> 00:05:44.970
tens of billions of dollars

147
00:05:42.99 --> 00:05:47.190
Kandice estimations are concerned we

148
00:05:44.97 --> 00:05:49.350
would be talking about hundreds of

149
00:05:47.19 --> 00:05:51.450
billions of dollars and there's more it

150
00:05:49.35 --> 00:05:53.400
looks like Israel lacks continental oil

151
00:05:51.45 --> 00:05:55.590
but there could be massive quantities of

152
00:05:53.4 --> 00:06:00.270
shale oil the type of oil the can only

153
00:05:55.59 --> 00:06:02.400
be extracted through fracking and well

154
00:06:00.27 --> 00:06:04.530
they've already found the first reserves

155
00:06:02.4 --> 00:06:06.210
this means that not only is Israel going

156
00:06:04.53 --> 00:06:09.270
to achieve energy independence but it

157
00:06:06.21 --> 00:06:10.980
could even become a new energy power now

158
00:06:09.27 --> 00:06:13.770
you might know why Netanyahu has

159
00:06:10.98 --> 00:06:15.960
referred to these fields as God's gift a

160
00:06:13.77 --> 00:06:18.660
few years ago Golda Meir the ex prime

161
00:06:15.96 --> 00:06:20.520
minister told this famous joke let me

162
00:06:18.66 --> 00:06:22.440
tell you something that we Israelis have

163
00:06:20.52 --> 00:06:23.880
against Moses he took us 40 years

164
00:06:22.44 --> 00:06:25.440
through the desert in order to bring us

165
00:06:23.88 --> 00:06:29.310
to the one spot in the Middle East that

166
00:06:25.44 --> 00:06:30.630
has no oil gold a mere well it sure

167
00:06:29.31 --> 00:06:32.340
looks like this is no longer the case

168
00:06:30.63 --> 00:06:33.780
and to this discovery the fact that

169
00:06:32.34 --> 00:06:35.820
Israel is one of the most innovative

170
00:06:33.78 --> 00:06:38.040
countries in the world and it's entirely

171
00:06:35.82 --> 00:06:40.050
possible it could soon become one of the

172
00:06:38.04 --> 00:06:41.760
world's wealthiest countries oh it's

173
00:06:40.05 --> 00:06:43.710
also probably important that we mention

174
00:06:41.76 --> 00:06:45.090
another player here then you guess who

175
00:06:43.71 --> 00:06:47.520
were the first to have an interest in

176
00:06:45.09 --> 00:06:50.040
these reserves it was the Russians yep

177
00:06:47.52 --> 00:06:52.470
again really Gazprom actually tried to

178
00:06:50.04 --> 00:06:54.510
buy them this all indicates that Israel

179
00:06:52.47 --> 00:06:56.580
could take a part of the Russian gas

180
00:06:54.51 --> 00:06:58.860
market share in Europe and as you

181
00:06:56.58 --> 00:07:01.279
already know energy means money and

182
00:06:58.86 --> 00:07:05.149
influence

183
00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:07.099
new allies the international situation

184
00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:10.069
of Israel it's always been controversial

185
00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.539
Wars political conflicts UN resolutions

186
00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.579
the Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs

187
00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:16.279
has to work harder than Santa Claus on

188
00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:19.129
Christmas Eve consider the last events

189
00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:21.529
from the UN UN Security Council passes

190
00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.809
resolution demanding end to Israeli

191
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:25.669
settlements well despite all of this the

192
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:27.199
truth is that Israeli foreign policy is

193
00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.419
stronger than ever Israeli authorities

194
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.429
are determined to put an end to their

195
00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.139
dependence on the United States and

196
00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:34.519
these recent gas and oil discoveries

197
00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.839
have certainly helped

198
00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:37.429
for example relations with their

199
00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:40.699
neighboring countries have improved

200
00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:42.589
quickly and by a great amount in 2010

201
00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.539
relations with turkey broke down almost

202
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:46.729
completely when Israel approached the

203
00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:49.069
Freedom Flotilla but now these relations

204
00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:50.449
are being healed this probably has a lot

205
00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:52.669
to do with the fact that arrogance

206
00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:54.860
country uses up massive quantities of

207
00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:56.689
natural gas and their import agreements

208
00:07:54.86 --> 00:07:58.909
with Russia will be over in just five

209
00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:01.009
years and we already know how unstable

210
00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:03.079
relations are lately between these two

211
00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:04.729
countries things are also working out

212
00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:06.439
great with their other neighbors Egypt

213
00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:08.179
and Jordan Israel hasn't just become

214
00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:10.159
Jordan's major gas supplier but the

215
00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:12.409
relations with Egypt's are working so

216
00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:13.729
well that Samar alkie the Minister of

217
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.409
Foreign Affairs watched football's

218
00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:16.909
European Championship final in the

219
00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:19.579
residence of the Israeli prime minister

220
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:20.829
further the unimaginable could even be

221
00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:23.179
happening some are talking about

222
00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:26.389
reconciliation between Israel and Saudi

223
00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:28.629
Arabia Israel Saudi Arabia are

224
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:30.919
reportedly negotiating economic ties

225
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:32.959
Israel is also bonding with tsipras

226
00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:34.759
Greece which has surprisingly become a

227
00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:36.860
close ally in fact the Israeli air

228
00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:38.750
forces now training Greece but the

229
00:08:36.86 --> 00:08:42.019
really major change has been from the

230
00:08:38.75 --> 00:08:44.059
east and in this process India was key

231
00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:46.370
India has made Israel its second-largest

232
00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:48.319
arms supplier behind Russia in the last

233
00:08:46.37 --> 00:08:50.389
decade India has bought from Israel more

234
00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:52.250
than ten billion dollars of military

235
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:54.230
equipments their relations are so good

236
00:08:52.25 --> 00:08:55.850
in fact in the fing 2015 for the first

237
00:08:54.23 --> 00:08:59.940
time in history the President of India

238
00:08:55.85 --> 00:09:03.070
went to Israel on an official visit

239
00:08:59.94 --> 00:09:05.440
Narendra Modi to become first Indian

240
00:09:03.07 --> 00:09:07.600
Prime Minister to visit Israel

241
00:09:05.44 --> 00:09:10.209
and let's just add one more thing on

242
00:09:07.6 --> 00:09:12.519
this subjects up until now Greeson in VF

243
00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:14.110
had been very critical of Israel as a

244
00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:16.000
consequence of the situation with

245
00:09:14.11 --> 00:09:17.680
Palestine so you can imagine what a step

246
00:09:16.0 --> 00:09:19.779
this was for the Israeli Ministry of

247
00:09:17.68 --> 00:09:20.470
Foreign Affairs and India is not the

248
00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:22.240
only one

249
00:09:20.47 --> 00:09:24.100
Israel is also building a close

250
00:09:22.24 --> 00:09:26.139
relationship with China and they are

251
00:09:24.1 --> 00:09:27.670
negotiating a free trade agreement

252
00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:29.439
besides Chinese businessman they're

253
00:09:27.67 --> 00:09:31.480
making strong investments in the country

254
00:09:29.439 --> 00:09:33.579
and they are even building a port in the

255
00:09:31.48 --> 00:09:35.400
city of Ashdod as part of their Silk

256
00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:37.730
Road project

257
00:09:35.4 --> 00:09:39.720
[Music]

258
00:09:37.73 --> 00:09:41.880
you

259
00:09:39.72 --> 00:09:44.580
closer relationships are developing with

260
00:09:41.88 --> 00:09:47.310
Vietnam South Korea it really seems that

261
00:09:44.58 --> 00:09:49.260
anywhere in Asia Israel is a total

262
00:09:47.31 --> 00:09:51.120
success and only we haven't forgotten

263
00:09:49.26 --> 00:09:52.110
about Donald Trump who for now meds

264
00:09:51.12 --> 00:09:54.030
committed to this

265
00:09:52.11 --> 00:09:57.570
it's our true friend over there and

266
00:09:54.03 --> 00:09:59.100
we're going to protect Israel 100%

267
00:09:57.57 --> 00:10:01.200
anyway there's still a long way to go to

268
00:09:59.1 --> 00:10:03.180
Israel to become an energy power but if

269
00:10:01.2 --> 00:10:05.400
they do it will have a positive effect

270
00:10:03.18 --> 00:10:07.890
for the area stability which but it

271
00:10:05.4 --> 00:10:09.180
would be a very good thing indeed Israel

272
00:10:07.89 --> 00:10:10.710
is well on its way to becoming a great

273
00:10:09.18 --> 00:10:12.390
country but there are still some things

274
00:10:10.71 --> 00:10:14.550
that need to be dealt with like the

275
00:10:12.39 --> 00:10:16.290
conflict in Palestine luckily better

276
00:10:14.55 --> 00:10:18.660
relations with Arabic countries could

277
00:10:16.29 --> 00:10:19.890
help in this matter a lot so now what do

278
00:10:18.66 --> 00:10:21.720
you think these things of this new

279
00:10:19.89 --> 00:10:24.120
energy wealth will contribute to the

280
00:10:21.72 --> 00:10:25.650
solution of this conflict and if you
