separates Europe and Asia Istanbul is a

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,529
city rooted in the most influential

9
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,420
corners of history few cities can boast

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,280
of having a past like there's a city

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
once known as Byzantium then

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,570
constantinople istanbul was once the

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,820
capital of three great empires the Roman

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,590
Empire of the East the Byzantine Empire

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,790
and the Ottoman Empire places like San

16
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,410
Sofia the Blue Mosque and the Grand

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,760
Bazaar are legacies from that era hold

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,010
on a second because all of that is well

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,990
it's the past

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,120
nowadays Istanbul is a lively city that

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,220
hosts more than 15 million inhabitants

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,260
it's the largest city in all of Europe

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,120
and it's also an important economic

Enclave one out of every three dollars

26
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,680
of turkey's gdp is generated here and

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,540
even the barely hosts 1/5 of the

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,340
country's entire population the Turkish

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,320
government gets about half of all its

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,420
tax revenue from Istanbul so we're

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,180
talking about he's true economic engine

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,500
here

[Music]

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,360
it's a growing financial logistics

35
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,230
commercial and of course a touristic hub

36
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,730
Istanbul attracts thirteen point four

37
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,460
million foreign visitors in 2018 however

38
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,200
in recent years Istanbul has begun to be

39
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,640
well known for a different kind of

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,340
tourism a very very special kind of

41
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,800
tourism and it is as controversial as it

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,570
is special so maybe you've heard of

43
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:57,050
medical tourism a high-flying tour every

44
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,490
year hundreds of millions of people

45
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,350
travel abroad to experience a new

46
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,540
culture and enjoy the Sun the beach the

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,160
mountains or the famous art and

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,340
architecture however another type of

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,000
unconventional but highly coveted

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,950
tourism this recently gains popularity

51
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,200
and that's medical tourism that is

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,670
travelling to another country to visit

53
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,280
its monuments its beaches and in passing

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,990
just also fix anything that they may

55
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,010
need fixed they usually come for three

56
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,170
days we offer them shopping or skiing

57
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,570
tours they get well and have a short

58
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,170
vacation

59
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,570
khasim devran Oulu the medical head of

60
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,430
dunya clothes group and i can already

61
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,660
tell you that for many governments

62
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,570
starting with turkeys this is a priority

63
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,860
now of course at this point we need to

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,420
answer to questions that many of you

65
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,489
might be asking the first is why go to

66
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,050
another country in search of medical

67
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,330
treatments well this has three very

68
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,090
clear answers the first is the price of

69
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,590
course if you have a medical procedure

70
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,000
that isn't covered by your health

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,459
insurance price matters a great deal for

72
00:02:58,459 --> 00:02:59,900
example some interventions and

73
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,640
treatments so much cheaper in Istanbul

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,410
than they are in the United States and

75
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,510
when I say much cheaper I mean much

76
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,880
cheaper they can be 50 60 70 even 80

77
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,239
percent cheaper

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,890
the second reason has to do with waiting

79
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,569
lists yeah you may be covered by your

80
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,489
health insurance or social security but

81
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,349
what about waiting lists in public

82
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:20,000
health systems such as those found in

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,799
Spain or the United Kingdom it's very

84
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,870
common to have waiting lists which can

85
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,220
be really quite long this of course

86
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,750
means that you have to wait a long time

87
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,159
for your turn but of course what happens

88
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,680
if you can't or you don't want to wait

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,049
then you need to find something on your

90
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,700
own and in that scenario the big

91
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,500
international medical centers don't

92
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,540
really have waiting lists soft they're

93
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,640
much shorter waiting time for a knee

94
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,470
surgery in a western country is 18

95
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,359
months but is only two weeks at the most

96
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:53,480
in Turkey every day a codon chairman of

97
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,980
the Istanbul International Health

98
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,930
Tourism Association check out how the

99
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,790
number of British medical tourists has

100
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,000
grown and the third reason is quality

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,830
yeah you had that right

102
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,990
when a place specializes in a particular

103
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,270
treatment and as many patients it tends

104
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,010
to be better you probably all know about

105
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,110
Houston Texas Medical Center which

106
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,000
serves about 10 million patients every

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,440
year and is one of the leading medical

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
centers on the planet in the end these

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,890
places have so many patients and so many

110
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,300
resources that not only are they very

111
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,860
good at their job they can also become

112
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,690
engines of medical research and

113
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,410
innovation but we said that we had two

114
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,630
questions we already answered one so

115
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,040
well what's the second the other

116
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,500
question is why exactly is this such an

117
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,960
important activity for a country why

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,700
would a government want to promote this

119
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,380
type of activity why would it want to

120
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,060
become an international healthcare

121
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,890
center what does it bring to a country

122
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:56,370
[Music]

123
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,560
well think about it along with the

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
traditional jobs that tourism creates

125
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,830
for example in the hotel industry

126
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,860
waiters cooks etc medical tourism helps

127
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,900
create a lot of highly qualified and

128
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,120
well-paid jobs doctors surgeons nurses

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,160
laboratory personnel medical device

130
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,220
suppliers etc I believe the city

131
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,080
hospitals will become the focal points

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,790
of health tourism we are setting up

133
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,130
special units in the city hospitals to

134
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,350
specifically serve foreign patients

135
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,800
Turkish Health Minister Farah Tanuja due

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,510
to the billing level since the type of

137
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,639
activity generated medical tourism is

138
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,070
like the Rolex of tourism and on top of

139
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,660
that it doesn't have the problem of

140
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,880
seasonality unlike holiday tourism which

141
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
tends to concentrate with interest a few

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,450
months usually during the summer and

143
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,580
it's precisely these reasons that have

144
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,080
prompted the Turkish government to place

145
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,150
great hope in medical tourism a lot of

146
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,070
hope and a lot of money in the form of

147
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,669
incentives fewer taxes financing aid etc

148
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,620
and you know what in a way it does make

149
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,260
a lot of sense

150
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,150
allow me to explain if turkey is already

151
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,190
a touristic power it has hotels

152
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,170
infrastructure all kinds of services a

153
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,060
lot of cultural attractions and places

154
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,320
like Istanbul they're only two or three

155
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,840
hours away by plane from the main cities

156
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,210
of Europe and the yeast so why not take

157
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,060
advantage well guys sir was says so it

158
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,520
was done

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,680
turkey attracted nearly 1 million health

160
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,980
tourists in 2018 industry official says

161
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,759
[Music]

162
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,740
and as I mentioned this type of tourism

163
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,360
leaves much more money in a country's

164
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,639
pockets than regular holiday tourism in

165
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,159
2018 medical tourists left more than two

166
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,629
billion dollars in Turkey

167
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,520
thus turkey is already the third largest

168
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,469
market in the world in terms of medical

169
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,749
and health tourism it stands only behind

170
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:49,039
the United States and South Korea so

171
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,839
medical tourism in Turkey is multiplied

172
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,569
by more than ten in the last decade just

173
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:56,569
in 2008 alone they welcomed 75,000

174
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,309
people in other words the industry is

175
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:04,849
skyrocketing Turkey's medical tourism

176
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,069
industry boosts visitor numbers when

177
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,809
turkey's traditional tourism industry

178
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,399
dried up the country turned to its

179
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,919
medical sector to attract a new wave of

180
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:15,349
visitors business destinations of course

181
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:16,879
all of this is just the beginning of

182
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,620
what the government expects the goal is

183
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,360
to generate five times as much income

184
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,789
from medical tourism by 2023 greatly

185
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,479
exceeding the ten billion dollar barrier

186
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,180
and some within the government and the

187
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,439
private sector are even more ambitious

188
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,899
their goal is 20 billion dollars it's a

189
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,580
huge business and it also gives the

190
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,100
country a large foreign currency inflow

191
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,530
dental care cosmetic surgery fertility

192
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,330
treatment cardiovascular interventions

193

transplants oncological treatments

194
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,300
turkey and particularly Istanbul wants

195
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,710
to become a world leader in

196
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,460
international medical tourism and in one

197
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,170
way or another this will be very good

198
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:07,070
for all of us why listen up the cluster

199
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,210
assemble is quickly becoming the world

200
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,220
leader in several medical specialities

201
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,860
from ophthalmology to knee care and hair

202
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,080
transplants in some of these fields it's

203
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,940
already number one on the entire planet

204
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,190
and it's that way because of price and

205
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,540
because of innovation yeah you heard

206
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,990
that right

207
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,030
it has to do with a logical and well

208
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,040
known market process called cluster

209
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,640
creation allow me to explain this

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,650
happens when a site specializes in an

211
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,630
activity and many competitors engage in

212
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,310
the same activity this causes everything

213
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,470
in the area to somehow begin to revolve

214
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,240
around that industry the number of

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
suppliers that compete with each other

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,810
multiplies public administrations begin

217
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,220
to facilitate things for this

218
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,050
increasingly influential industry

219
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,780
universities work with these companies

220
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,540
etc

221
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,459
this creates a more dynamic ecosystem

222
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,139
and it multiplies its innovation

223
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:04,029
capacity in other words so to speak

224
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:06,129
Istanbul is becoming the Silicon Valley

225
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,589
of cataracts and hair transplants for

226
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,389
whoever might want them all this might

227
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,550
sound like a bit of a joke but it really

228
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,500
isn't the city of Basra is already has

229
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,689
hundreds of clinics that specialize in

230
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,699
these types of activity in many cases

231
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,230
we're talking about very new clinics

232
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,939
with very advanced treatments and it's

233
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:24,279
estimated that by 2025 these types of

234
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,040
interventions will move tens and tens of

235
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,769
billions of dollars worldwide anyway I

236
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,110
think we can now understand news like

237
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,709
this a bit better the global medical

238
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,899
tourism market size is expected to reach

239
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,819
one hundred and seventy nine point six

240
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:42,399
billion dollars by 2026 registering a

241
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,779
twenty one point nine percent kegger

242
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,730
during the forecast period so I really

243
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,019
