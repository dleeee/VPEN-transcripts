[Applause]

2
00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.750
are the European Union it's sort of like

3
00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.910
the windows of politics did slow it

4
00:00:12.75 --> 00:00:17.520
doesn't work perfectly and sometimes it

5
00:00:14.91 --> 00:00:19.410
just crashes nonetheless all that has to

6
00:00:17.52 --> 00:00:21.960
be honest the other alternatives are not

7
00:00:19.41 --> 00:00:24.090
much better and can certainly be more

8
00:00:21.96 --> 00:00:28.519
costly at the beginning of this year it

9
00:00:24.09 --> 00:00:28.519
seems like the far right was unstoppable

10
00:00:28.55 --> 00:00:33.149
some political analysts claimed that

11
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:35.460
brexit would be the beginning of the end

12
00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
for the European Union and during this

13
00:00:35.46 --> 00:00:39.450
time the international media was full of

14
00:00:37.41 --> 00:00:41.370
words like freshness or checks it

15
00:00:39.45 --> 00:00:43.320
however this euro skeptic Fuhrer wasn't

16
00:00:41.37 --> 00:00:45.450
to last for long Frances elected a brand

17
00:00:43.32 --> 00:00:48.059
new president in Manuel Makram who

18
00:00:45.45 --> 00:00:52.020
stands up for the European Union like no

19
00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.940
one else the same has happens in other

20
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:56.160
elections around Europe in other words

21
00:00:53.94 --> 00:00:58.829
the European Union is alive and kicking

22
00:00:56.16 --> 00:01:00.239
at least for the next four years

23
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.039
but do hold on for just a minute because

24
00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.070
things are more complex than what they

25
00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.780
might seem in fact not all EU fans are

26
00:01:05.07 --> 00:01:08.729
the same and many of them don't even

27
00:01:06.78 --> 00:01:11.159
share the same opinion on what the EU

28
00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
should be for instance the chrome stands

29
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.259
for a fiscal union with the same taxes

30
00:01:13.68 --> 00:01:21.540
in every country certainly the Angela

31
00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.130
Merkel nor John Claude Juncker are into

32
00:01:21.54 --> 00:01:25.409
that on the other hand the former

33
00:01:23.13 --> 00:01:27.570
Belgian Prime Minister give the hofstadt

34
00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.729
who is now president of the European

35
00:01:27.57 --> 00:01:32.100
Liberal Party says that Europe should

36
00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.009
become a federation like the United

37
00:01:32.1 --> 00:01:37.799
States but does everyone agree with that

38
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.860
well the answer is rather unsurprisingly

39
00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.990
no in fact the only thing shared by all

40
00:01:40.86 --> 00:01:46.280
these politicians is the fact that the

41
00:01:42.99 --> 00:01:48.440
EU is a good thing

42
00:01:46.28 --> 00:01:50.510
so now the questions are well what is

43
00:01:48.44 --> 00:01:52.640
the European Union we'll about what

44
00:01:50.51 --> 00:01:54.830
should it become is it a Federation or a

45
00:01:52.64 --> 00:01:56.600
confederation and what are the different

46
00:01:54.83 --> 00:01:59.180
models on the negotiation table

47
00:01:56.6 --> 00:02:08.420
well today we are going to answer all of

48
00:01:59.18 --> 00:02:10.820
these questions what did Margaret

49
00:02:08.42 --> 00:02:12.590
Thatcher was right Margaret Thatcher is

50
00:02:10.82 --> 00:02:14.870
something like Elvis Presley to

51
00:02:12.59 --> 00:02:16.220
Euroskeptics for decades that this woman

52
00:02:14.87 --> 00:02:18.620
who is the British prime minister in the

53
00:02:16.22 --> 00:02:20.540
1980s has become the biggest inspiration

54
00:02:18.62 --> 00:02:25.720
for many of the movements that want to

55
00:02:20.54 --> 00:02:29.330
end the European project but then again

56
00:02:25.72 --> 00:02:31.459
reality is seldom simple now it is true

57
00:02:29.33 --> 00:02:33.320
that Margaret Thatcher was a big critic

58
00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.090
of political integration back in the

59
00:02:33.32 --> 00:02:36.739
time the European Union still didn't

60
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:38.420
exist it was just a community of

61
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.000
countries that traded among themselves

62
00:02:38.42 --> 00:02:43.160
nevertheless during the 1980s different

63
00:02:41.0 --> 00:02:47.360
European governments agreed to deepen

64
00:02:43.16 --> 00:02:49.280
this integration this is when they

65
00:02:47.36 --> 00:02:51.470
started talking about a single currency

66
00:02:49.28 --> 00:02:53.930
and new institution all of this

67
00:02:51.47 --> 00:02:55.790
culminated in 1992 with the signing of

68
00:02:53.93 --> 00:02:57.410
the Maastricht Treaty so the question is

69
00:02:55.79 --> 00:02:58.850
what did Margaret Thatcher think about

70
00:02:57.41 --> 00:03:00.830
all of this well the truth is different

71
00:02:58.85 --> 00:03:04.050
forget about stereotypes and we actually

72
00:03:00.83 --> 00:03:05.540
read her memoir we find prints like this

73
00:03:04.05 --> 00:03:08.069
[Music]

74
00:03:05.54 --> 00:03:10.769
riki does not dream of some cozy

75
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.170
isolated existence on the fringes of the

76
00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.610
european community our destiny is in

77
00:03:13.17 --> 00:03:18.930
Europe as part of the community but

78
00:03:17.61 --> 00:03:21.150
importantly this doesn't mean that

79
00:03:18.93 --> 00:03:23.640
thatcher was in total agreements with

80
00:03:21.15 --> 00:03:25.950
all the european politicians she just

81
00:03:23.64 --> 00:03:27.480
wanted a different model unlike those

82
00:03:25.95 --> 00:03:29.700
who wanted a United States of Europe

83
00:03:27.48 --> 00:03:33.209
with the capital in Brussels she stood

84
00:03:29.7 --> 00:03:35.250
for a Confederate model certainly we

85
00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.409
want to see Europe more United and was a

86
00:03:35.25 --> 00:03:39.389
greater sense of common purpose but it

87
00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.250
must be in a way which preserves the

88
00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.799
different traditions parliamentary

89
00:03:41.25 --> 00:03:46.639
powers and sense of national pride in

90
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.639
one's own country

91
00:03:47.17 --> 00:03:50.780
poor we keep going we got to explain

92
00:03:49.52 --> 00:03:56.480
what's the difference between a

93
00:03:50.78 --> 00:03:58.310
federation and a confederation an

94
00:03:56.48 --> 00:04:00.200
example of a federation would be the

95
00:03:58.31 --> 00:04:02.210
United States of America Texas in

96
00:04:00.2 --> 00:04:03.890
California have their own legislatures

97
00:04:02.21 --> 00:04:06.740
their own governments and their own laws

98
00:04:03.89 --> 00:04:09.380
today for instance marijuana is legal in

99
00:04:06.74 --> 00:04:11.720
California but illegal in Texas however

100
00:04:09.38 --> 00:04:14.000
if the Congress in Washington DC were to

101
00:04:11.72 --> 00:04:16.070
pass a law legalizing cannabis across

102
00:04:14.0 --> 00:04:17.810
the country any state law that would

103
00:04:16.07 --> 00:04:19.489
contradict the federal one would be

104
00:04:17.81 --> 00:04:21.200
automatically abolished in a

105
00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.390
confederation that states have way more

106
00:04:21.2 --> 00:04:25.730
autonomy today there are actually no

107
00:04:23.39 --> 00:04:27.620
Confederations in the world not even in

108
00:04:25.73 --> 00:04:29.330
Switzerland of course then Switzerland

109
00:04:27.62 --> 00:04:31.370
the different Canton's enjoy a lot of

110
00:04:29.33 --> 00:04:33.140
autonomy and different taxes but that

111
00:04:31.37 --> 00:04:35.210
doesn't mean they are a confederation

112
00:04:33.14 --> 00:04:36.980
for instance if the Parliament of Brno

113
00:04:35.21 --> 00:04:39.290
would pass the law legalizing marijuana

114
00:04:36.98 --> 00:04:41.920
the rest of the Canton's would have to

115
00:04:39.29 --> 00:04:41.920
accept it

116
00:04:43.95 --> 00:04:48.210
if Switzerland was a real Confederation

117
00:04:46.53 --> 00:04:49.860
each of the different assemblies would

118
00:04:48.21 --> 00:04:51.920
have to have a vote to decide whether

119
00:04:49.86 --> 00:04:54.390
they want to keep cannabis legal or not

120
00:04:51.92 --> 00:04:56.460
so despite what a lot of people say

121
00:04:54.39 --> 00:04:58.140
Switzerland is clearly a federation and

122
00:04:56.46 --> 00:04:59.850
so now you might be wondering well what

123
00:04:58.14 --> 00:05:02.280
exactly is Europe then is it a

124
00:04:59.85 --> 00:05:04.020
Federation or a confederation of course

125
00:05:02.28 --> 00:05:05.490
there are a lot of people who stand for

126
00:05:04.02 --> 00:05:07.500
the federal model in the last few years

127
00:05:05.49 --> 00:05:09.060
the champion of this idea has been the

128
00:05:07.5 --> 00:05:11.700
presidents of the Liberals either

129
00:05:09.06 --> 00:05:14.880
hofstadt that we need to reform Europe

130
00:05:11.7 --> 00:05:18.570
to make it a real Federation capable to

131
00:05:14.88 --> 00:05:21.330
act not only on in the economic fields

132
00:05:18.57 --> 00:05:24.420
but also by establishing a defense union

133
00:05:21.33 --> 00:05:26.430
by establishing a European investigation

134
00:05:24.42 --> 00:05:28.230
capacity but let's go down to the facts

135
00:05:26.43 --> 00:05:30.510
today despite what it looks like

136
00:05:28.23 --> 00:05:32.850
national governments have a lot of

137
00:05:30.51 --> 00:05:34.890
autonomy for instance years ago Brussels

138
00:05:32.85 --> 00:05:36.990
passed the directive banning smoking in

139
00:05:34.89 --> 00:05:38.940
bars after that each of the member

140
00:05:36.99 --> 00:05:41.040
countries had to vote on their own and

141
00:05:38.94 --> 00:05:42.930
Peter backer law men as well you know

142
00:05:41.04 --> 00:05:45.270
what happened well Austria and the Czech

143
00:05:42.93 --> 00:05:46.920
Republic did not pass those laws and

144
00:05:45.27 --> 00:05:49.050
during those years you could smoke in

145
00:05:46.92 --> 00:05:50.820
the cafe's of Prague or Vienna while in

146
00:05:49.05 --> 00:05:53.180
Berlin and Paris it was completely

147
00:05:50.82 --> 00:05:53.180
forbidden

148
00:05:57.45 --> 00:06:01.230
feelings of the 80 which is the main

149
00:05:59.55 --> 00:06:03.270
European taxes difference in each

150
00:06:01.23 --> 00:06:05.160
country in say maybe twenty one percent

151
00:06:03.27 --> 00:06:06.780
but in Hungary they pay twenty seven

152
00:06:05.16 --> 00:06:09.000
percent ends in Germany they've got a

153
00:06:06.78 --> 00:06:10.680
nineteen percent tax in other words your

154
00:06:09.0 --> 00:06:13.440
if is not a Federation's that it's also

155
00:06:10.68 --> 00:06:16.050
not a confederation either it's kind of

156
00:06:13.44 --> 00:06:17.340
a Federal Confederation and now you're

157
00:06:16.05 --> 00:06:19.410
probably wondering is this Federal

158
00:06:17.34 --> 00:06:21.600
Confederation model actually working or

159
00:06:19.41 --> 00:06:26.220
do we need to move ahead with some sort

160
00:06:21.6 --> 00:06:28.500
of the United States of Europe what's

161
00:06:26.22 --> 00:06:30.060
wrong in the European Union we all heard

162
00:06:28.5 --> 00:06:31.980
about the many mistakes this European

163
00:06:30.06 --> 00:06:33.900
integration has made that the traces

164
00:06:31.98 --> 00:06:36.360
many of these flaws could have happened

165
00:06:33.9 --> 00:06:37.590
in the Member States individually as an

166
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:39.510
example let us have a look at the

167
00:06:37.59 --> 00:06:41.550
refugee crisis now it is true that

168
00:06:39.51 --> 00:06:43.770
Brussels was incapable of crafting a

169
00:06:41.55 --> 00:06:44.970
common policy to give asylum to all the

170
00:06:43.77 --> 00:06:47.640
citizens that are running away from

171
00:06:44.97 --> 00:06:49.560
countries like Syria Iraq or Libya but

172
00:06:47.64 --> 00:06:52.620
let's not lie to ourselves the same

173
00:06:49.56 --> 00:06:54.240
happens in every single country in Spain

174
00:06:52.62 --> 00:06:56.340
for example the national government did

175
00:06:54.24 --> 00:06:58.380
everything they could to avoid welcoming

176
00:06:56.34 --> 00:07:01.010
the refugees on the other hand Madrid

177
00:06:58.38 --> 00:07:03.510
City Hall did the exact opposite

178
00:07:01.01 --> 00:07:05.550
devaluation an absolute project earlier

179
00:07:03.51 --> 00:07:07.710
Casillas City Hall of Madrid will make a

180
00:07:05.55 --> 00:07:09.720
welcoming project so the refugees will

181
00:07:07.71 --> 00:07:11.670
have a place to live in other words we

182
00:07:09.72 --> 00:07:13.410
cannot expect Brussels to solve the

183
00:07:11.67 --> 00:07:16.110
problems that nation-states have always

184
00:07:13.41 --> 00:07:16.920
had in politics of things they're simply

185
00:07:16.11 --> 00:07:18.990
not possible

186
00:07:16.92 --> 00:07:20.880
but do you hold on for a moment because

187
00:07:18.99 --> 00:07:23.010
this does not mean the European Union is

188
00:07:20.88 --> 00:07:24.900
perfect either in fact there are many

189
00:07:23.01 --> 00:07:25.510
problems that are endemic to this

190
00:07:24.9 --> 00:07:27.770
institution

191
00:07:25.51 --> 00:07:29.940
[Music]

192
00:07:27.77 --> 00:07:31.650
for example let's imagine you are a

193
00:07:29.94 --> 00:07:33.300
freelancer living in Hungary and you

194
00:07:31.65 --> 00:07:36.150
work for a company based in Belgium

195
00:07:33.3 --> 00:07:37.800
should you include dat on the invoice

196
00:07:36.15 --> 00:07:39.450
that you said to them well according to

197
00:07:37.8 --> 00:07:41.490
EU legislation you shouldn't because

198
00:07:39.45 --> 00:07:43.710
well it's a service contract that each

199
00:07:41.49 --> 00:07:46.470
country has its own tax laws that in

200
00:07:43.71 --> 00:07:48.720
many cases contradicts the EU laws but

201
00:07:46.47 --> 00:07:50.880
not only that what dat should you

202
00:07:48.72 --> 00:07:52.530
include on that invoice the Hungarian

203
00:07:50.88 --> 00:07:54.480
one or the Belgium one all these

204
00:07:52.53 --> 00:07:57.420
problems could be solved if there was a

205
00:07:54.48 --> 00:07:59.130
common ground on taxation matters but

206
00:07:57.42 --> 00:08:00.450
many countries don't want to lose

207
00:07:59.13 --> 00:08:02.310
sovereignty on this matter

208
00:08:00.45 --> 00:08:03.880
and no one dares make the first step

209
00:08:02.31 --> 00:08:05.500
towards them

210
00:08:03.88 --> 00:08:07.690
you

211
00:08:05.5 --> 00:08:09.760
so as you might imagine from this it's

212
00:08:07.69 --> 00:08:12.490
pretty hard for important decisions to

213
00:08:09.76 --> 00:08:17.130
move forward so the question is what

214
00:08:12.49 --> 00:08:20.430
could be the solution to this problem a

215
00:08:17.13 --> 00:08:22.990
club with different kinds of members

216
00:08:20.43 --> 00:08:25.360
constitutions they are useful they allow

217
00:08:22.99 --> 00:08:27.820
politicians and legislators to know what

218
00:08:25.36 --> 00:08:30.190
they can do and what they can't it's

219
00:08:27.82 --> 00:08:31.840
sort of like a minimal agreement this

220
00:08:30.19 --> 00:08:34.479
way a government knows what it can pass

221
00:08:31.84 --> 00:08:39.099
as a law and it's a system that has been

222
00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:40.900
proven effective so well what's the

223
00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:43.390
problem well all the attempts to release

224
00:08:40.9 --> 00:08:45.820
a European Constitution have failed in

225
00:08:43.39 --> 00:08:47.710
2005 both France and the Netherlands had

226
00:08:45.82 --> 00:08:50.170
referendums where they rejected the

227
00:08:47.71 --> 00:08:52.150
proposal for a European Magna Carta

228
00:08:50.17 --> 00:08:53.620
years later Brussels politicians met

229
00:08:52.15 --> 00:08:55.480
again to write a new version of this

230
00:08:53.62 --> 00:08:58.030
Constitution these so-called Lisbon

231
00:08:55.48 --> 00:09:00.100
Treaty this was a milder version of the

232
00:08:58.03 --> 00:09:02.710
previously drafted constitution but

233
00:09:00.1 --> 00:09:04.540
integration problems persisted the truth

234
00:09:02.71 --> 00:09:06.280
is that each country has its own

235
00:09:04.54 --> 00:09:08.500
interests and it's hard to get them all

236
00:09:06.28 --> 00:09:10.960
on the same page so why not just

237
00:09:08.5 --> 00:09:12.940
recognize the differences and this is

238
00:09:10.96 --> 00:09:15.100
why the European Commission has made the

239
00:09:12.94 --> 00:09:17.470
European white book where they imagine

240
00:09:15.1 --> 00:09:22.030
five potential scenarios for a new

241
00:09:17.47 --> 00:09:23.890
reform one of them would allow each

242
00:09:22.03 --> 00:09:25.570
state to have a different level of

243
00:09:23.89 --> 00:09:27.760
integration on the other hand at the

244
00:09:25.57 --> 00:09:30.400
beginning of 2017 the economists

245
00:09:27.76 --> 00:09:32.350
proposed to create a European Union with

246
00:09:30.4 --> 00:09:34.690
different kinds of memberships at one

247
00:09:32.35 --> 00:09:36.160
hand there would be a premium member who

248
00:09:34.69 --> 00:09:38.260
would share a common currency

249
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:40.000
common fiscal policy and a common

250
00:09:38.26 --> 00:09:41.410
foreign policy or another one there

251
00:09:40.0 --> 00:09:43.000
would be a silver member who would just

252
00:09:41.41 --> 00:09:44.950
share a common market and the free

253
00:09:43.0 --> 00:09:46.480
movement area other members let's call

254
00:09:44.95 --> 00:09:49.000
them the bronze category would have

255
00:09:46.48 --> 00:09:51.280
access to just the common market

256
00:09:49.0 --> 00:09:53.260
this way it would be way easier to

257
00:09:51.28 --> 00:09:55.000
convince every country to pass a

258
00:09:53.26 --> 00:09:56.950
European Constitution in the meantime

259
00:09:55.0 --> 00:09:59.170
the idea of a United States of Europe

260
00:09:56.95 --> 00:10:00.400
it's lost a lot of supporters the idea

261
00:09:59.17 --> 00:10:02.680
of a Europe with different membership

262
00:10:00.4 --> 00:10:06.670
levels however currently enjoys a lot of

263
00:10:02.68 --> 00:10:08.440
support meanwhile Frances brand-new

264
00:10:06.67 --> 00:10:10.780
president is willing to play a major

265
00:10:08.44 --> 00:10:12.520
role in the future of Europe but what

266
00:10:10.78 --> 00:10:13.990
does he really stand for well we're not

267
00:10:12.52 --> 00:10:15.430
answering that in this video but if

268
00:10:13.99 --> 00:10:17.800
you'd like to know more about Emmanuel

269
00:10:15.43 --> 00:10:21.880
macron don't forget to check out this

video that we take so now our question

271
00:10:21.88 --> 00:10:26.140
to you is do you think this hybrid of a

272
00:10:24.16 --> 00:10:28.180
federal Confederation with different

273
00:10:26.14 --> 00:10:30.220
than the categories can actually work or

274
00:10:28.18 --> 00:10:32.320
should we keep trying for a federation

275
00:10:30.22 --> 00:10:33.790
where everyone has the same rules please

276
00:10:32.32 --> 00:10:35.290
