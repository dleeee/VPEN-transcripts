3
00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.800
Brazil is the country of the future but

4
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.599
it seems like we've been hearing that

5
00:00:10.8 --> 00:00:13.679
for a long time lately though we've

6
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.839
heard a lot about the country's

7
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.250
corruption scandals the economic crisis

8
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
is going through all the street violence

9
00:00:17.25 --> 00:00:21.060
in cities like Rio de Janeiro but there

10
00:00:19.56 --> 00:00:22.710
is something even more important about

11
00:00:21.06 --> 00:00:27.689
this country something that doesn't

12
00:00:22.71 --> 00:00:30.539
appear very much in the media Brazil is

13
00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.910
the most expensive country in all of

14
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.710
South America yep you heard that right

15
00:00:32.91 --> 00:00:36.930
if you go shopping in a city like Sao

16
00:00:34.71 --> 00:00:38.879
Paulo or Rio de Janeiro you'd better be

17
00:00:36.93 --> 00:00:41.640
ready to clean out your wallet because

18
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.329
it will be as expensive as New York or

19
00:00:41.64 --> 00:00:43.890
London

20
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
the Brazilians even have a name for this

21
00:00:43.89 --> 00:00:47.550
they call it custo Brazil this is the

22
00:00:46.44 --> 00:00:49.710
special charge you have to pay for

23
00:00:47.55 --> 00:00:52.020
living in the country of Samba so let's

24
00:00:49.71 --> 00:00:53.760
look at an example the Big Mac burger

25
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:55.350
that you buy from McDonald's if you've

26
00:00:53.76 --> 00:00:56.730
been subscribed to visual politic for a

27
00:00:55.35 --> 00:00:58.739
long time you already know that the

28
00:00:56.73 --> 00:01:01.170
economists use something called the Big

29
00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.270
Mac index to measure the cost of living

30
00:01:01.17 --> 00:01:07.860
in a country for example in Switzerland

31
00:01:06.27 --> 00:01:10.140
one of the wealthiest countries in the

32
00:01:07.86 --> 00:01:12.840
world the Big Mac costs a whopping six

33
00:01:10.14 --> 00:01:14.400
point seven five dollars then we have

34
00:01:12.84 --> 00:01:16.590
Peru a poorer country where the burger

35
00:01:14.4 --> 00:01:18.900
only costs three dollars and 23 cents

36
00:01:16.59 --> 00:01:21.299
fair enough right well in Brazil the Big

37
00:01:18.9 --> 00:01:23.670
Mac costs five dollars and ten cents

38
00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.189
it's more expensive than in Denmark the

39
00:01:23.67 --> 00:01:28.439
UK or Canada according to the expat

40
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.299
estanque on websites our power is the

41
00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.150
most expensive city in South America

42
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.650
with prices as high as Houston Texas

43
00:01:33.15 --> 00:01:36.650
Berlin or Germany

44
00:01:38.59 --> 00:01:42.640
and now you might wonder given the high

45
00:01:40.63 --> 00:01:45.100
cost of living how high a Brazilian

46
00:01:42.64 --> 00:01:47.860
salaries of a wealthier save and

47
00:01:45.1 --> 00:01:50.200
Colombians or Chileans well absolutely

48
00:01:47.86 --> 00:01:51.850
not the average wage in Brazil is less

49
00:01:50.2 --> 00:01:53.680
than $600 a month

50
00:01:51.85 --> 00:01:54.909
Argentinians and Chileans are actually

51
00:01:53.68 --> 00:01:56.679
better off in this regard

52
00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.080
so the real question here is why is

53
00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.210
Brazil so expensive what are the reasons

54
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:03.729
why a middle-income country has the

55
00:02:01.21 --> 00:02:05.530
prices of a wealthy one well today we

56
00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.450
are going to answer this question and

57
00:02:05.53 --> 00:02:11.769
believe me this also partly explains the

58
00:02:07.45 --> 00:02:14.200
Brazilian crisis too so let's dive in an

59
00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.760
isolated economy many of you might think

60
00:02:14.2 --> 00:02:17.769
of Brazil as a country opens a free

61
00:02:15.76 --> 00:02:19.690
trade right well at the end of the day

62
00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.970
many foreign companies like MasterCard

63
00:02:19.69 --> 00:02:23.810
or Barclays have a strong presence in

64
00:02:21.97 --> 00:02:29.410
this country

65
00:02:23.81 --> 00:02:31.660
[Music]

66
00:02:29.41 --> 00:02:34.180
nonetheless Brazil has the highest

67
00:02:31.66 --> 00:02:36.130
tariffs in South America so what does

68
00:02:34.18 --> 00:02:38.680
this mean well imagine we have a

69
00:02:36.13 --> 00:02:40.300
cellphone manufacturer in America and

70
00:02:38.68 --> 00:02:42.550
they wanted to sell on the Brazilian

71
00:02:40.3 --> 00:02:45.130
market since our product is made abroad

72
00:02:42.55 --> 00:02:47.560
we must sell it with a special tax that

73
00:02:45.13 --> 00:02:49.210
could reach up to 35% of its market

74
00:02:47.56 --> 00:02:51.430
price as you can imagine this type of

75
00:02:49.21 --> 00:02:52.480
policy has a pretty big impact on

76
00:02:51.43 --> 00:02:54.720
everyday life

77
00:02:52.48 --> 00:02:57.220
[Music]

78
00:02:54.72 --> 00:02:59.770
Nintendo exits Brazilian market due to

79
00:02:57.22 --> 00:03:01.690
high tariffs yes you heard that right

80
00:02:59.77 --> 00:03:04.300
during those years Brazilians who wanted

81
00:03:01.69 --> 00:03:06.430
to buy a Wii or a Nintendo DS had to

82
00:03:04.3 --> 00:03:08.200
travel to Uruguay in order to find one

83
00:03:06.43 --> 00:03:10.410
interestingly this was a great advantage

84
00:03:08.2 --> 00:03:13.150
for Nintendo's biggest rivals especially

85
00:03:10.41 --> 00:03:15.550
Microsoft and the Xbox and you know why

86
00:03:13.15 --> 00:03:17.800
while Microsoft has a factory in Brazil

87
00:03:15.55 --> 00:03:19.270
where the Xbox one is made this means

88
00:03:17.8 --> 00:03:21.250
they don't have to import it and

89
00:03:19.27 --> 00:03:23.820
therefore it doesn't have those high

90
00:03:21.25 --> 00:03:23.820
tariffs

91
00:03:24.1 --> 00:03:28.590
[Music]

92
00:03:25.31 --> 00:03:30.180
and yes I know you're thinking high

93
00:03:28.59 --> 00:03:31.800
tariffs are cool because they force

94
00:03:30.18 --> 00:03:34.080
companies to build factories in your

95
00:03:31.8 --> 00:03:37.050
country and employ your citizens right

96
00:03:34.08 --> 00:03:39.360
well think twice there when Microsoft

97
00:03:37.05 --> 00:03:41.250
opens their Brazilian Factory they still

98
00:03:39.36 --> 00:03:43.350
need to import all the machines and

99
00:03:41.25 --> 00:03:44.670
materials needed to manufacture that

100
00:03:43.35 --> 00:03:46.500
Xbox one

101
00:03:44.67 --> 00:03:48.780
this can be plastic semiconductors

102
00:03:46.5 --> 00:03:50.120
robots many of these things aren't made

103
00:03:48.78 --> 00:03:54.030
somewhere else

104
00:03:50.12 --> 00:03:55.709
and if they are made somewhere else

105
00:03:54.03 --> 00:03:57.959
they still have these special tariffs

106
00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.570
and you can guess who pays for these

107
00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.400
extra costs of course it's the consumer

108
00:04:00.57 --> 00:04:04.380
this explains why so many products

109
00:04:02.4 --> 00:04:06.840
manufactured in Brazil are so expensive

110
00:04:04.38 --> 00:04:08.820
what an example take the Volkswagen Golf

111
00:04:06.84 --> 00:04:11.020
in Mexico City this car costs around

112
00:04:08.82 --> 00:04:12.980
fifteen thousand US dollars

113
00:04:11.02 --> 00:04:15.860
[Music]

114
00:04:12.98 --> 00:04:17.630
in Sao Paulo it cost 25 thousand US

115
00:04:15.86 --> 00:04:19.760
dollars all of this despite the fact

116
00:04:17.63 --> 00:04:22.460
that this specific model of automobile

117
00:04:19.76 --> 00:04:23.660
is manufactured in Sao Paulo but wait a

118
00:04:22.46 --> 00:04:26.360
minute because this is not the only

119
00:04:23.66 --> 00:04:28.010
thing that explains this custo Brazil or

120
00:04:26.36 --> 00:04:32.960
the Brazilians used to refer to this

121
00:04:28.01 --> 00:04:34.940
incredibly high cost of living just a

122
00:04:32.96 --> 00:04:37.070
cool store let's imagine someone doing

123
00:04:34.94 --> 00:04:38.630
soy agriculture in the state of power in

124
00:04:37.07 --> 00:04:40.669
the north of this country if he wants to

125
00:04:38.63 --> 00:04:42.710
send his soy to Sal Paulo he must carry

126
00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.410
it on trucks through the highway be are

127
00:04:42.71 --> 00:04:47.449
163 this highway has over a thousand

128
00:04:45.41 --> 00:04:49.820
kilometres and a hundred of its are not

129
00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.470
even paved a simple rainy day is enough

130
00:04:49.82 --> 00:04:53.600
to keep those trucks stuck in the mud

131
00:04:51.47 --> 00:04:55.280
and this is just one example

132
00:04:53.6 --> 00:04:58.630
in fact Brazil has some of the worst

133
00:04:55.28 --> 00:04:58.630
infrastructure in the world

134
00:04:59.74 --> 00:05:04.450
even India has better roads so to make a

135
00:05:02.47 --> 00:05:07.540
comparison anytime an American farmer

136
00:05:04.45 --> 00:05:09.340
sells $100 in soy he has to spend nine

137
00:05:07.54 --> 00:05:11.830
dollars on transportation the same

138
00:05:09.34 --> 00:05:13.930
farmer in Brazil they'd have to pay $25

139
00:05:11.83 --> 00:05:16.090
since they have no good roads Brazilians

140
00:05:13.93 --> 00:05:18.040
have to invest in expensive trucks that

141
00:05:16.09 --> 00:05:20.740
break down quickly and make the cost

142
00:05:18.04 --> 00:05:23.410
even more expensive and of course all of

143
00:05:20.74 --> 00:05:25.750
this means higher and higher prices for

144
00:05:23.41 --> 00:05:27.460
Brazilian customers but now you might be

145
00:05:25.75 --> 00:05:29.320
wondering well why is the Brazilian

146
00:05:27.46 --> 00:05:30.850
government so reluctant to pay for

147
00:05:29.32 --> 00:05:32.650
infrastructure at the end of the day

148
00:05:30.85 --> 00:05:34.480
Brazil has state-of-the-art engineering

149
00:05:32.65 --> 00:05:35.220
companies companies like the Auto bracht

150
00:05:34.48 --> 00:05:38.739
group

151
00:05:35.22 --> 00:05:38.739
[Music]

152
00:05:39.57 --> 00:05:43.210
if you happen to be someone watching

153
00:05:41.68 --> 00:05:45.580
from a South American country while this

154
00:05:43.21 --> 00:05:47.230
name probably rings a bell few other act

155
00:05:45.58 --> 00:05:49.540
was the biggest engineering and

156
00:05:47.23 --> 00:05:51.730
construction company in the region and I

157
00:05:49.54 --> 00:05:53.200
do say was here because they had the

158
00:05:51.73 --> 00:05:55.390
biggest corruption scandal in the

159
00:05:53.2 --> 00:05:57.340
history of the continent and naturally

160
00:05:55.39 --> 00:06:00.160
with that the future of the firm is

161
00:05:57.34 --> 00:06:02.680
looking pretty dim but this story does

162
00:06:00.16 --> 00:06:04.360
explain well why Brazil has such poor

163
00:06:02.68 --> 00:06:06.370
infrastructure because at the end of the

164
00:06:04.36 --> 00:06:08.830
day part of the money goes towards

165
00:06:06.37 --> 00:06:10.840
bribes and corruption but not only that

166
00:06:08.83 --> 00:06:12.760
when the Brazilian government's wanted

167
00:06:10.84 --> 00:06:18.010
to modernize their country well what did

168
00:06:12.76 --> 00:06:19.840
they do well they decided to host the

169
00:06:18.01 --> 00:06:21.490
Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup

170
00:06:19.84 --> 00:06:23.200
so today Brazilian cities can

171
00:06:21.49 --> 00:06:25.150
congratulate themselves for having the

172
00:06:23.2 --> 00:06:26.830
most beautiful sports arenas with

173
00:06:25.15 --> 00:06:28.900
high-end technology and luxurious

174
00:06:26.83 --> 00:06:30.250
decoration today taking a walk in the

175
00:06:28.9 --> 00:06:32.980
center of south power it feels like

176
00:06:30.25 --> 00:06:34.750
being in a sci-fi movie but outside of

177
00:06:32.98 --> 00:06:36.850
this metropolis the railroads are

178
00:06:34.75 --> 00:06:38.620
abandoned the highways are unpaved and

179
00:06:36.85 --> 00:06:40.660
several neighborhoods don't have a

180
00:06:38.62 --> 00:06:43.770
single bus line that connects them with

181
00:06:40.66 --> 00:06:43.770
the city centre

182
00:06:44.07 --> 00:06:49.270
missiles woeful infrastructure cost the

183
00:06:46.66 --> 00:06:51.580
economy as much as 48 billion US dollars

184
00:06:49.27 --> 00:06:53.950
per year now of course this effects the

185
00:06:51.58 --> 00:06:56.110
prices for Brazilian consumers but also

186
00:06:53.95 --> 00:06:58.180
for worldwide consumers who want to buy

187
00:06:56.11 --> 00:06:59.680
Brazilian goods but that is something

188
00:06:58.18 --> 00:07:01.300
we're actually going to address in a

189
00:06:59.68 --> 00:07:02.740
future video because now the question

190
00:07:01.3 --> 00:07:04.510
really becomes how can someone who makes

191
00:07:02.74 --> 00:07:06.340
six hundred bucks a month spend twenty

192
00:07:04.51 --> 00:07:09.250
five bucks on Pizza at an average

193
00:07:06.34 --> 00:07:15.970
restaurant in South Paulo well I am

194
00:07:09.25 --> 00:07:17.610
going to tell you how render holics for

195
00:07:15.97 --> 00:07:20.380
decades Brazil had some of the highest

196
00:07:17.61 --> 00:07:23.410
inflation in the world during the 1980s

197
00:07:20.38 --> 00:07:25.660
and 90s they had more than 6-thousand

198
00:07:23.41 --> 00:07:28.120
percent inflation this means if you had

199
00:07:25.66 --> 00:07:30.550
a beer at a Rio de Janeiro bar in 1980

200
00:07:28.12 --> 00:07:32.440
you would pay 100 crucero the createrra

201
00:07:30.55 --> 00:07:34.750
was the Brazilian currency back then one

202
00:07:32.44 --> 00:07:36.970
year later that same beer would cost six

203
00:07:34.75 --> 00:07:39.220
hundred thousand cruzeiro's as you can

204
00:07:36.97 --> 00:07:42.450
imagine hyperinflation created unique

205
00:07:39.22 --> 00:07:42.450
consumer behaviour

206
00:07:43.84 --> 00:07:47.449
behavior that was quite different from

207
00:07:45.86 --> 00:07:49.400
the rest of the world in order to

208
00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.830
survive Brazilian ships got used to

209
00:07:49.4 --> 00:07:53.690
selling with installments and this is

210
00:07:51.83 --> 00:07:55.669
still a thing today if you go to any

211
00:07:53.69 --> 00:07:58.280
Brazilian shop you can see that next to

212
00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:00.830
the prices says something like 10 X 12 X

213
00:07:58.28 --> 00:08:03.530
or 20 X this number means that you can

214
00:08:00.83 --> 00:08:09.740
pay for this product on 10 12 or 20

215
00:08:03.53 --> 00:08:11.840
installments in other words the question

216
00:08:09.74 --> 00:08:13.880
many Brazilians ask themselves is not

217
00:08:11.84 --> 00:08:15.860
whether this TV or this suit is more or

218
00:08:13.88 --> 00:08:18.590
less expensive but if they can pay for

219
00:08:15.86 --> 00:08:20.060
it during the next two years and as you

220
00:08:18.59 --> 00:08:22.910
can imagine when you buy something in

221
00:08:20.06 --> 00:08:23.380
installments it is far more expensive

222
00:08:22.91 --> 00:08:25.389
[Applause]

223
00:08:23.38 --> 00:08:27.219
[Music]

224
00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:29.050
the example on the screen we're showing

225
00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:31.030
you a smartphone on a brazilian

226
00:08:29.05 --> 00:08:33.519
ecommerce website if you bought it once

227
00:08:31.03 --> 00:08:35.169
it costs 632 wrists which is equivalent

228
00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:37.149
to two hundred and two dollars at the

229
00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.039
moment we made this video nonetheless if

230
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:40.899
you buy with installments it costs two

231
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.450
hundred and seventeen US dollars which

232
00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:45.459
is a seven percent increase so as you

233
00:08:43.45 --> 00:08:49.630
can imagine your average Brazilian is in

234
00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:54.160
debt all the time nearly sixty percent

235
00:08:49.63 --> 00:08:55.810
of Brazilians in installment debt but

236
00:08:54.16 --> 00:08:57.370
wait just a minute because this is not

237
00:08:55.81 --> 00:08:58.630
the worst of it in the last year

238
00:08:57.37 --> 00:09:00.910
something has happened in Brazil that

239
00:08:58.63 --> 00:09:06.040
has turned custo Brazil into a real

240
00:09:00.91 --> 00:09:07.839
nightmare renege card held at the

241
00:09:06.04 --> 00:09:10.149
beginning of the 2000s Brazil was the

242
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:12.279
perfect market for foreign banks big

243
00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:15.839
financial firms like Santander or Credit

244
00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:17.890
Suisse started investing in the country

245
00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:19.870
and don't forget we're talking about a

246
00:09:17.89 --> 00:09:22.060
200 million person country that was on

247
00:09:19.87 --> 00:09:23.440
the rise here where prices were high and

248
00:09:22.06 --> 00:09:24.070
people are used to paying for things in

249
00:09:23.44 --> 00:09:27.010
installments

250
00:09:24.07 --> 00:09:30.339
in other words Brazil was a paradise for

251
00:09:27.01 --> 00:09:32.140
selling credit cards since 2005 brazil's

252
00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:35.610
credit card market has grown at a 20%

253
00:09:32.14 --> 00:09:35.610
plus rate annually

254
00:09:39.05 --> 00:09:43.370
by the year 2012 Brazilians had an

255
00:09:41.42 --> 00:09:45.950
average of two credit cards per person

256
00:09:43.37 --> 00:09:47.330
and they really knew how to use them

257
00:09:45.95 --> 00:09:48.890
Brazil was the country with the most

258
00:09:47.33 --> 00:09:51.350
credit payments across all of South

259
00:09:48.89 --> 00:09:54.100
America nonetheless at happiness it

260
00:09:51.35 --> 00:09:54.100
didn't last very long

261
00:09:54.61 --> 00:09:59.240
resilient consumer default and credit

262
00:09:56.899 --> 00:10:01.670
cards has reached 27 percent in April

263
00:09:59.24 --> 00:10:03.410
2012 in the very same year 2012 the

264
00:10:01.67 --> 00:10:05.600
alarm started to sound in all those

265
00:10:03.41 --> 00:10:07.100
Brazilian banks the country was in the

266
00:10:05.6 --> 00:10:08.990
middle of a crisis with rising

267
00:10:07.1 --> 00:10:11.120
unemployment and declining salaries and

268
00:10:08.99 --> 00:10:13.190
that made it hard for Brazilians to pay

269
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:14.899
back their debts so what happens when a

270
00:10:13.19 --> 00:10:18.730
bank is afraid of getting into falters

271
00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:21.230
well they raise the interest rates

272
00:10:18.73 --> 00:10:23.420
residents have to pay four hundred and

273
00:10:21.23 --> 00:10:25.459
fourteen percent interest on their

274
00:10:23.42 --> 00:10:26.690
credit cards so imagine you use your

275
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:28.700
credit card to buy a TV screen that

276
00:10:26.69 --> 00:10:30.740
costs you a thousand US dollars and you

277
00:10:28.7 --> 00:10:32.330
pay for it in 12 installments well at

278
00:10:30.74 --> 00:10:34.430
the end of the day counting the interest

279
00:10:32.33 --> 00:10:37.279
rate of the credit card the TV costs

280
00:10:34.43 --> 00:10:38.720
around five thousand US dollars pretty

281
00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:40.610
impressive isn't it and don't forget

282
00:10:38.72 --> 00:10:42.050
that the average wage in Brazil is less

283
00:10:40.61 --> 00:10:43.610
than $600 a month

284
00:10:42.05 --> 00:10:45.230
in other words no matter the

285
00:10:43.61 --> 00:10:46.940
anti-poverty measures taken by the

286
00:10:45.23 --> 00:10:48.800
government most Brazilians are

287
00:10:46.94 --> 00:10:50.959
struggling to survive and west of all

288
00:10:48.8 --> 00:10:55.670
since they can't save money losing a job

289
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:58.070
can be a real tragedy for many homeless

290
00:10:55.67 --> 00:11:01.870
population in Rio de Janeiro increases a

291
00:10:58.07 --> 00:11:01.870
hundred fifty percent in three years

292
00:11:02.47 --> 00:11:07.520
so here is the question now can Brazil

293
00:11:05.54 --> 00:11:09.800
get over this situation who could

294
00:11:07.52 --> 00:11:11.000
possibly reform this country well we'd

295
00:11:09.8 --> 00:11:12.590
