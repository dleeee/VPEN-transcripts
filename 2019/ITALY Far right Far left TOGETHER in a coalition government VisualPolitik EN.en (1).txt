00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:04,319
you might think this is austria or

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,779
switzerland but what if i told you this

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,269
is italy but listen carefully if i told

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,950
you that you'd expect the people there

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,170
to be speaking italian right

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,750
well then it'd be wrong the main spoken

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,199
language here is German Sophie from

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,480
Coeur d'Alene isn't thinking and of

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,720
course this is South Tyrol in fact we

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,220
think that Italian is the main language

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,730
spoken in Italy but no Italy is full of

13
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,890
dialects and languages that are hardly

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,809
understandable from one another someone

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,670
from Veneto in the north could hardly

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,379
understand somebody from Sicily in the

17
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,719
south yes Italy is a country of

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,000
contrasts and the same goes for their

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,650
politics

20
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,120
can you imagine a far-right party

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,130
forming a coalition with a liberal

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,140
populist one could you imagine a

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,420
trump-like Republican a lying with

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,820
someone who advocates for a basic income

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,400
for the poor well this is pretty much

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,010
what has happens in Italy so how is it

27
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,900
possible for the right and the left join

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,970
forces to form a government that can run

29
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,860
the country well in this video we're

30
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,630
gonna tell you that story

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,180

[Music]

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,770
Italy is a country of contradictions on

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,450
the one hand it's the country

35
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,790
surrounding the Vatican and it maintains

36
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,159
respect for its Catholic traditions but

37
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,540
on the other hand they had silvio

38
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,939
berlusconi a man famous for his orgies

39
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,580
as the prime minister for many years

40
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,090
[Music]

41
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,860
on one hands they are one of the most

42
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,689
over regulated countries in Europe with

43
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,850
red tape all over the place on the other

44
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,860
hand the black market here is bigger

45
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,470
than almost anywhere else in Europe if

46
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,549
that doesn't sound like enough

47
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:51,070
contradictions to you then check this

48
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,520
out

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,679
Italy's government is now a coalition of

50
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,960
a far right-wing party and a far

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,450
left-wing one now it's true the five

52
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,159
star movement isn't exactly a far left

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,020
political party at least not in the

54
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,570
Ocasio cortes kind of way but what do

55
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,979
you call a party that advocates for

56
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,229
things like basic income for the poor or

57
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,630
reducing for salaries of politicians so

58
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,560
they're more like the working-class

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,170
[Music]

60
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,150
and the same goes for the far right wing

61
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,800
many of you might say that the Liga

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,569
Party is not as extreme as other ultra

63
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,910
politicians but what do you call an

64
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,130
anti-immigration ultra nationalist party

65
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,930
then the funniest thing about this party

66
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,790
is that they began as a secessionist

67
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,190
movement in facts originally Liga was

68
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,200
called lega Nord which means the

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000
Northern League and they wanted Italy to

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,070
be split into two different countries

71
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,570
now however they've changed their minds

72
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,660
and present as the Paragons of Italian

73
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,130
pride but hold on a second because you

74
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,350
might now be wondering why don't even

75
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,120
care about this well first of all that's

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,110
because of Italy's size Italy has the

77
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,700
third biggest economy in the eurozone

78
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,400
and suffers from the worst recession if

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,709
they fall Europe might fall too and if

80
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,720
you're a Falls the rest of the world may

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,330
fall along with it but also the case of

82
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,280
a coalition of opposite extremes can

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,470
serve as a cautionary tale for many

84
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,970
other countries something similar

85
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,980
happens in Greece for instance when the

86
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,110
leftists ERISA forms a coalition with

87
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,540
the right-wing annal or even the Czech

88
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,860
Republic where the Communist Party

89
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,079
shares an office with a xenophobic group

90
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,510
and a liberal one so definitely yes

91
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,190
Italy helps us understand how the

92
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,620
political spectrum is changing elsewhere

93
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,780
so now the question is how is even

94
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,250
possible that the right and the left

95
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,680
could merge together can this strange

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,049
formula succeed in order to bring the

97
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,090
country out of its collapse well today

98
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,530
we're going to answer all of these

99
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,870
questions but before we do let's take a

100
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,530
look back at the history

101
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,819
[Music]

102
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:53,730
from lega Nord to just lega as we said

103
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,200
before there are a lot of different

104
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,750
languages in Italy approximately 34

105
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,760
distinct dialects in fact but the

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,709
difference is they don't stop there you

107
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,780
can also tell which region is which when

108
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,420
it comes to economics southern Italy has

109
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,940
an unemployment rate close to 20 percent

110
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,459
in places like Sicily water shortages

111
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,470
were a common thing until very recently

112
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,299
and most of the people who work in

113
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,989
agriculture but northern Italy is a

114
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:27,479
totally different country this is where

115
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,760
brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini were

116
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,370
born cities like Milan de famous

117
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,050
worldwide for their fashion industry

118
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,030
their factories and their high standard

119
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,889
of living their unemployment rate is a

120
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,440
third of that in the south and their

121
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
income will be double that of the

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
southerners the big divide is what

123
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,449
explains the birth of the Northern

124
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,430
League party in the 90s as I said at the

125
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,110
beginning of this video the party was

126
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,720
founded as a regionalist secessionist

127
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,789
movement the forerunner was umberto

128
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,220
bossy originally he wanted his own

129
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,710
region body where Milan is to become

130
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,750
independent from the rest of Italy but

131
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,800
then one day he thought well why not

132
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,780
unify several northern regionalist

133
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,880
movements into one

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,710
[Music]

135
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,479
this is how the biggest separatist

136
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,580
movement in Italy was born originally it

137
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,229
was not meant to be a right or a left

138
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,229
wing party in fact its founders came

139
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:19,669
from pretty much everywhere on the

140
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,169
political spectrum they had one goal and

141
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,720
one goal only to split Italy into

142
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,729
basically the country they wanted to

143
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,560
create was called padania and it

144
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,419
comprised of all the northern italian

145
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,789
regions as with the separatist movements

146
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,470
they claimed several cultural

147
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,449
differences but unlike with Scottish

148
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:37,460
separatism the main reason for this

149
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,860
self-determination movements was money

150
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,789
basically

151
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,560
Bosse claims that Rome was stealing

152
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,570
money from the rich regions to give to

153
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,139
the poor

154
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,000
so therefore they'd be better off going

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,250
off on their own and believe me when it

156
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,560
comes to hating Italy it was pretty

157
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,340
straightforward

158
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,100
when I see the Italian flag I feel like

159
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,800
I used the green white and red to clean

160
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,580
my act

161
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,130
umberto bossy bossy went as far as

162
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,560
declaring padania independent from Italy

163
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,150
in 1996 he owned a independent sovereign

164
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,140
tada lapa Dania but look that separatist

165
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,820
as they might be this northern league

166
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,190
was still an Italian party this means

167
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,960
they had to play by the Italian rules

168
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,910
and run for the Italian parliament and

169
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,680
in order to expand their national

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,030
influence they became one of the most

171
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,400
loyal allies of Berlusconi this helps

172
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,050
them get very good results because their

173
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,150
voters could see that despite being a

174
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,220
regional party the Northern League had

175
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,320
enough power to influence politics and

176
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,690
bring lots of perks to the regions that

177
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,310
they represent it wakeup padania with

178
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,200
the Northern League against the thieves

179
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,330
of Rome but as influential as they could

180
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,070
be they could only get up to eight point

181
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,540
three percent of the vote this meant

182
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,650
that they were still a small political

183
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,010
party but things changed in 2012 that

184
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,900
was the year when Umberto basi suffered

185
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,090
a stroke and had to leave the party his

186
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,460
successor was the man here Matteo

187
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,280
salvini he had a radical change in mind

188
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,590
for the party first of all he changed

189
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,120
the name so it went from northern league

190
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,790
to just league and that kind of

191
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,400
rebranding it means one thing and that's

192
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,680
the party was evolving the electoral

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,300
program it was not focused on the

194
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,860
separation of the north from the south

195
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,620
anymore finally the enemy it wasn't Rome

196
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,540
but rather who was the immigrants

197
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,930
[Music]

198
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,790
more immigrants mean more criminals

199
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,950
salvini is working on a repatriation

200
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,170
plan and so what happens to that anti

201
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,940
Italian feeling I'm bei still the

202
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,250
biggest enemy of the Petain Ian's well

203
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,840
if you think a party you can't change

204
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,450
its mind from one day to the other well

205
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,839
think again

206
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,300
raise your head Italy I'm proud of being

207
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
Italian we are the best country in the

208
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,409
world we just need to have a little bit

209
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,990
of work and a little less taxes Matteo

210
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,650
salvini

211
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,749
and boom there you go now the former

212
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:08,490
Northern League could apply to all

213
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,680
Italian voters both southern and

214
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,349
northern this means a bigger voting

215
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,629
market and better results and I know you

216
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,039
might be thinking right now can anybody

217
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
take a party that can change its core

218
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,509
ideology virtually overnight seriously

219
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:28,439
and the answer was oh yes make our

220
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,870
victory at Italian elections the times

221
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,669
they are a-changin but if this doesn't

222
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,649
seem crazy enough to you let's take a

223
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:36,300
look at the other player in this game

224
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:44,740
the Italian populist laughed

225
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,370
the big joke it's the year 2009 and

226
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,290
Italy is dealing with a big crisis the

227
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,240
European Union wants budget cuts and

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,100
Berlusconi in his government they're in

229
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,090
dire straits

230
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,800
that's the fertile grounds on which the

231
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,780
five stars movement was founded during

232
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,210
those years a famous comedian beppe egg

233
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,660
Rio started a platform

234
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,340
he had a little to no idea how big his

235
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,290
blog and his movement were about to

236
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,970
become perhaps the most interesting

237
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,800
moment of the movements developing phase

238
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,730
was the 2007 vaffanculo day in bologna

239
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,940
literally this means fuck off day it was

240
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,650
a huge advancement to collect signatures

241
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,500
to change the venn electoral law they

242
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,330
wanted to ban people convicted of crimes

243
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,430
from running for parliamentary election

244
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,170
but the real opportunity for Pepe Grillo

245
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,850
came some years later the Italian

246
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,530
economy was still struggling more and

247
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,390
more citizens couldn't make ends meet

248
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,000
and this is when Italy got a fully

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
technocratic president Mario Monti a

250
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,830
technocrat is somebody who claims not to

251
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,080
have any specific ideology just tries to

252
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,450
solve problems and manage politics based

253
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,820
on expertise and analysis but many

254
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,950
Italians this seemed to be an imposition

255
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,410
from the European Union who wanted more

256
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,750
and more budget cuts and more austerity

257
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,269
so this anger is what gave a mint in

258
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,250
Tibet they agree Leo and his five star

259
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,139
movement the movement started winning

260
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,480
and placing its members in regional and

261
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,370
local cabinets this momentum gave him a

262
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,769
chance to run in the 2013 general

263
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,720
election where they were the second most

264
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,209
popular party after the Democratic Party

265
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:23,639
surpassing everyone's expectations they

266
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,160
gained more than 8 million votes which

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,829
is a pretty huge number for a brand new

268
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,900
party

269
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,810
the elections results are in huge

270
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,970
victory for the five star movement the

271
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,980
websi forea for the first party in the

272
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,200
Chamber of Deputies the movement started

273
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,820
an anti-establishment force and

274
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,589
therefore at the beginning it didn't

275
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,779
seem to have a very detail-oriented

276
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,240
plan but all the work it paid off and

277
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,400
all those votes gave them the push they

278
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,589
needed it was time for a detailed plan

279
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,410
it was time to become more structured

280
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,300
their first huge win meant even more

281
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,430
wins and the movement swings the

282
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,070
movements ideology became Clara directed

283
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,860
democracy as an evolution of

284
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,120
representative democracy the idea that

285
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,710
citizens would no longer delegate their

286
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,710
power to parties was at the base of

287
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,900
Russo and online voting platform through

288
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,150
Russo the registered users of m5s

289
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,760
discuss approve or reject legislative

290
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,620
proposals for example the choice to

291
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,270
support the abolition of Al or against

292
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,010
immigrants was taken online by the

293
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,750
movements members even if the final

294
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,910
decision was against Korea's own opinion

295
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,029
below the m5s registered voters say no

296
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,160
to making legal immigration a criminal

297
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,110
offense another chapter of the party's

298
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,300
life began when Luigi de Meyer came into

299
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,389
power in 2017 in 2018 he became the

300
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:44,829
Deputy Prime Minister of Italy and

301
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,899
Minister of Economic Development labour

302
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:48,820
and social policies the improbable

303
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,220
ascent of a 31 year old college dropout

304
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,320
and former soccer stadium Russia is

305
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,000
really a measure of the country's

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,339
turbulent political landscape and so on

307
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:58,870
one hand we have a seasoned to

308
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,310
right-wing politician all on the other

309
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,649
hands we have a 31 year old freshman and

310
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,660
they were tied together in an unlikely

311
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,740
marriage by that 2018 election open

312
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,790
marriage

313
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,649
Italy is infamous for having weaker than

314
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,600
usual political alliances and parties

315
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,610
since the country was proclaimed a

316
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,250
republic in 1946 it has had 29 prime

317
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,899
ministers with an average government

318
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,269
length of just 2.5 years every election

319
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,490
is a brand new start for everyone the

320
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,040
last big change came in 2018 when a new

321
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,690
government was established after a very

322
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,940
complicated post-election period the new

323
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,769
government's is an alliance as we said

324
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,899
between the anti-establishment 5-stars

325
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,300
movements and the far-right league the

326
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,029
populist wave split Italy in half the

327
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,410
South voted for the five star movement

328
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,130
and the north voted for the lega

329
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,430
[Music]

330
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,140
but both sides expressed a vote of

331
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,760
protest against the more traditional

332
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,650
parties like the Democratic Party these

333
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,810
new numbers show real shift in Italy's

334
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,060
electoral geography the success of the

335
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,130
two most anti-establishment forces is

336
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,290
mostly due to economic uncertainty the

337
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,390
outsiders have become the mainstream

338
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,920
immediately after the elections the

339
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,780
five-star movements the party that got

340
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,370
the most votes needed to find a

341
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,800
coalition party the choice was the

342
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,690
leaguer

343
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,220
[Music]

344
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,650
Italy election populist five-star and

345
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,600
League to vie for power but this

346
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,580
marriage wasn't an easy one it took ten

347
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,200
weeks to reach an agreement the two

348
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,300
parties they were adversaries before the

349
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,770
election but at the same time they

350
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,780
became the largest groups able to muster

351
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,000
a majority in both houses and so the

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,490
five star brought to the table 32% and

353
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,790
the league brought 17 and with that thus

354
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,490
began the new government we're now a few

355
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,900
months in the to deputy Prime Minister's

356
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,210
are doing as much as possible to fulfill

357
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,830
the promises they made to their voters

358
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,510
salvini is trying to crack down on

359
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,790
immigration and to pass a flat rate tax

360
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,590
of 15 percent for companies and

361
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,000
individuals which experts would say

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,890
would cut tax revenues by 80 billion

363
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,320
euros per year DeMaio is trying to make

364
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,630
a huge basic income reform happen it's

365
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,370
universal income for the poor that would

366
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,800
cost an estimated 17 billion euros per

367
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,690
year the two leaders they're basically

368
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,490
in an open marriage they're together but

369
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,960
they're still looking around for

370
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,390
partners both parties are still trying

371
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,160
to get the biggest amounts of political

372
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,260
capital possible for the next election

373
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,720
cycle but pleasing and electorates is in

374
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,070
itself a very difficult feat to

375
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,930
accomplish even without further

376
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,400
obstacles

377
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,880
but Dolce vida slips away again as Italy

378
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,010
tumbles back into recession the country

379
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,779
is now in a recession just as the

380
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,790
Italian deputy Prime Minister's stated

381
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,589
that Italy was on the cusp of an

382
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,200
economic miracle in 2018 that gdp

383
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,540
decreased by 0.2 percent this is the

384
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,360
third recession in 10 years but the

385
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,580
Italian PM says not to worry

386
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,500
he stated that a recession is determined

387
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,810
by the European economic cycle or

388
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,700
whatever that means while politicians

389
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,410
playing the blame it on the people who

390
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,360
were there before card many Italians are

391
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,800
extremely worried about how this

392
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,540
recession could have an impact on their

393
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,700
lives for years to come Italy is the

394
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,050
second largest debt in the euro area

395
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,570
after Greece but its economy is eight

396
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,240
times larger and a crisis this big could

397
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,029
severely cripple the eurozone so now the

398
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,470
question is is it possible that we'll

399
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,240
see a similar alliance in other

400
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,130
countries maybe this alliance can save

401
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,440
the country from further crisis or maybe

402
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,000
it's going to make things worse well

403
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,710
please leave your answer in the comments
