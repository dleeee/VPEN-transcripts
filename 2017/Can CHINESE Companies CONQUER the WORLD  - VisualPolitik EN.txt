3
00:00:07.37 --> 00:00:14.360
China is already a giant this country is

4
00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.360
the largest trading power in the world

5
00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.470
they need the world with hundreds of

6
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.420
products and have one of the largest

7
00:00:19.47 --> 00:00:23.580
foreign currency reserves in the entire

8
00:00:21.42 --> 00:00:25.769
planet not even the Petro monarchies in

9
00:00:23.58 --> 00:00:27.960
the Persian Gulf can compete with this

10
00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.060
giant country and with all of this it

11
00:00:27.96 --> 00:00:32.009
isn't surprising to find some honest sea

12
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:34.170
states that China will surpass the

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.270
United States as the leading economic

14
00:00:34.17 --> 00:00:38.280
power bars they're gonna do that with a

15
00:00:36.27 --> 00:00:40.500
lot more inhabitants however we usually

16
00:00:38.28 --> 00:00:42.210
figure out a very important thing and

17
00:00:40.5 --> 00:00:44.789
this is that GDP well it's not

18
00:00:42.21 --> 00:00:46.950
everything economic power the real power

19
00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.379
is closely related to corporate power

20
00:00:46.95 --> 00:00:51.539
and when it comes to that China is still

21
00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.160
a long way from reaching the levels of

22
00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.710
the United States if we look at the top

23
00:00:53.16 --> 00:00:57.989
100 largest companies in the world 56 of

24
00:00:55.71 --> 00:00:59.969
them are American and only 11 are

25
00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.800
Chinese and this is something to really

26
00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.140
bear in mind because multinationals are

27
00:01:01.8 --> 00:01:06.630
in control of foreign investments and of

28
00:01:04.14 --> 00:01:08.280
80% of the world's exports now the big

29
00:01:06.63 --> 00:01:10.680
question is what's gonna happen to these

30
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:12.840
Chinese companies in the future how are

31
00:01:10.68 --> 00:01:14.850
things changing and what can we really

32
00:01:12.84 --> 00:01:16.380
expect these are some of the questions

33
00:01:14.85 --> 00:01:19.220
though we're going to be answering in

34
00:01:16.38 --> 00:01:19.220
today's video

35
00:01:19.47 --> 00:01:25.480
the Chinese giant's development

36
00:01:23.5 --> 00:01:27.550
the Chinese economy has had an

37
00:01:25.48 --> 00:01:29.560
impressive growth rate in the last three

38
00:01:27.55 --> 00:01:32.050
decades and key to this was the concept

39
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:34.300
of them being the world's Factory this

40
00:01:32.05 --> 00:01:35.920
is what China is known for they are

41
00:01:34.3 --> 00:01:38.560
known as a country that has become a

42
00:01:35.92 --> 00:01:40.930
world power and has lifted hundreds of

43
00:01:38.56 --> 00:01:43.300
thousands of people from poverty with a

44
00:01:40.93 --> 00:01:45.670
relatively simple premise producing

45
00:01:43.3 --> 00:01:49.690
everything and producing it at a low

46
00:01:45.67 --> 00:01:51.970
cost toys electronics tools clothing

47
00:01:49.69 --> 00:01:53.710
when you enter a store you are going to

48
00:01:51.97 --> 00:01:55.510
find hundreds of products with something

49
00:01:53.71 --> 00:01:58.180
in common and that's that they are all

50
00:01:55.51 --> 00:02:02.770
manufactured in massive industrial areas

51
00:01:58.18 --> 00:02:04.990
located all over China however in order

52
00:02:02.77 --> 00:02:07.480
for a country to really be the leading

53
00:02:04.99 --> 00:02:09.729
economic power these companies need to

54
00:02:07.48 --> 00:02:12.040
start producing much more complex

55
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.930
products man's they will have to stop

56
00:02:12.04 --> 00:02:16.360
competing on cost and start looking at

57
00:02:13.93 --> 00:02:18.250
for higher added value this can include

58
00:02:16.36 --> 00:02:20.560
the production of things like capital

59
00:02:18.25 --> 00:02:25.350
assets planes medical devices and

60
00:02:20.56 --> 00:02:25.350
computer processes that driverless car

61
00:02:25.36 --> 00:02:30.610
Intel's driving the future traffic light

62
00:02:28.15 --> 00:02:36.390
street lamps business problems on the

63
00:02:30.61 --> 00:02:36.390
cloud and the cloud runs on Intel

64
00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.549
and today all these sectors are

65
00:02:38.9 --> 00:02:42.920
dominated by the large multinational

66
00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:50.900
companies of the United States South

67
00:02:42.92 --> 00:02:52.310
Korea Europe and Japan much that is true

68
00:02:50.9 --> 00:02:54.140
the many leading products are

69
00:02:52.31 --> 00:02:57.140
manufactured in China for example the

70
00:02:54.14 --> 00:02:59.510
iPhone but this is not exactly true

71
00:02:57.14 --> 00:03:01.670
because what China actually doing is

72
00:02:59.51 --> 00:03:03.530
more like the assembly what this means

73
00:03:01.67 --> 00:03:04.849
is that the more complex parts they're

74
00:03:03.53 --> 00:03:07.220
bought from other countries and then

75
00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.959
they are simply put together in China so

76
00:03:07.22 --> 00:03:11.569
you better illustrate this consider this

77
00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.340
each year China imports more than 200

78
00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.200
billion dollars in semiconductors which

79
00:03:13.34 --> 00:03:17.090
are essential in the manufacturing of

80
00:03:15.2 --> 00:03:18.790
mobile devices just for a comparison

81
00:03:17.09 --> 00:03:21.590
that is more money than what the entire

82
00:03:18.79 --> 00:03:23.560
country spends on petrol

83
00:03:21.59 --> 00:03:26.810
however Chinese companies have made many

84
00:03:23.56 --> 00:03:29.359
advances today

85
00:03:26.81 --> 00:03:31.579
1/4 of all exports are capital goods

86
00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.450
such as machines for example or

87
00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.489
high-tech products in some sectors like

88
00:03:35.45 --> 00:03:39.620
telecommunications wind turbines or

89
00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.849
high-speed trains Chinese companies are

90
00:03:39.62 --> 00:03:42.849
the world leaders

91
00:03:44.43 --> 00:03:48.120
and it's not just that because Chinese

92
00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:54.060
companies are also learning how to make

93
00:03:48.12 --> 00:03:58.560
it in the international market the great

94
00:03:54.06 --> 00:04:00.629
Chinese conquest 2016 was the 40th

95
00:03:58.56 --> 00:04:02.310
anniversary of the ends of the Cultural

96
00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.680
Revolution this was a terrifying

97
00:04:02.31 --> 00:04:07.260
campaign which Mao organized in order to

98
00:04:04.68 --> 00:04:09.659
purify the revolution and finish off all

99
00:04:07.26 --> 00:04:12.000
remnants of capitalism in Chinese

100
00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.970
society well since then things have

101
00:04:12.0 --> 00:04:17.489
changed a lot so much that China is only

102
00:04:14.97 --> 00:04:19.199
behind the United States in terms of

103
00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.060
numbers of multinational companies

104
00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.530
companies in this country they're

105
00:04:21.06 --> 00:04:25.260
starting to make it into global markets

106
00:04:22.53 --> 00:04:26.180
and well they're doing it really really

107
00:04:25.26 --> 00:04:29.130
well

108
00:04:26.18 --> 00:04:32.070
2016 Chinese companies spent an

109
00:04:29.13 --> 00:04:34.169
incredible amount of money 225 billion

110
00:04:32.07 --> 00:04:36.180
dollars in purchase of foreign companies

111
00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.630
in Europe in the United States alone

112
00:04:36.18 --> 00:04:41.630
they acquired more than 450 companies

113
00:04:41.86 --> 00:04:46.449
these Chinese companies are buying all

114
00:04:44.02 --> 00:04:47.919
kinds of businesses mining companies

115
00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.500
banks oil companies pharmaceutical

116
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.139
companies agricultural companies even

117
00:04:50.5 --> 00:04:55.389
luxury hotel chains jewelry companies

118
00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.039
and football clubs yep yeah that right

119
00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.870
dear viewer the Chinese have even bought

120
00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.129
in to Milan and that is just one example

121
00:05:00.87 --> 00:05:05.199
Manchester City gets a four hundred

122
00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.150
million dollar Chinese investment deal

123
00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.699
but if there is one thing in particular

124
00:05:07.15 --> 00:05:13.960
that the Chinese love to invest in well

125
00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.520
that would be developing countries even

126
00:05:13.96 --> 00:05:17.710
though Australia and the United States

127
00:05:15.52 --> 00:05:20.169
are the two countries that received the

128
00:05:17.71 --> 00:05:22.240
most in Chinese investment dollars more

129
00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.550
than half of all Chinese investment is

130
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:27.069
made in emerging countries located in

131
00:05:24.55 --> 00:05:29.949
Asia Africa Latin America and the Middle

132
00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:32.110
East so we could almost say that the

133
00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.349
more risky the country the more willing

134
00:05:32.11 --> 00:05:37.659
the Chinese are to invest in it now this

135
00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.279
might surprise you but this this is not

136
00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:42.340
the end of the story Chinese companies

137
00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.469
are also starting to compete hard well

138
00:05:42.34 --> 00:05:46.000
if there was only one Chinese company in

139
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:50.169
the top 100 most valuable companies in

140
00:05:46.0 --> 00:05:53.729
2006 there were 14 by the Year 2015 and

141
00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.729
take a look at the smartphone industry

142
00:05:55.95 --> 00:06:01.290
up until recently having a Chinese phone

143
00:05:58.47 --> 00:06:03.600
well it was a bit weird right well today

144
00:06:01.29 --> 00:06:06.060
the four main Chinese manufacturers Oppo

145
00:06:03.6 --> 00:06:07.650
Huawei vivo and Xiao Mei aren't just

146
00:06:06.06 --> 00:06:10.710
more famous than they were a few years

147
00:06:07.65 --> 00:06:12.660
ago they also take more than 10% of the

148
00:06:10.71 --> 00:06:14.760
world's profits in this industry and

149
00:06:12.66 --> 00:06:17.310
this is a figure that is growing more

150
00:06:14.76 --> 00:06:18.660
and more every single year and if you

151
00:06:17.31 --> 00:06:20.550
want another example well you just have

152
00:06:18.66 --> 00:06:22.260
to look to Lenovo which is a Chinese

153
00:06:20.55 --> 00:06:24.450
multinational company that was born just

154
00:06:22.26 --> 00:06:27.060
a few years ago and indeed it bought the

155
00:06:24.45 --> 00:06:29.190
laptop division of IBM and is now the

156
00:06:27.06 --> 00:06:31.440
largest computer company in the world

157
00:06:29.19 --> 00:06:33.630
and they even supply equipment to the

158
00:06:31.44 --> 00:06:35.520
Pentagon and had even more examples

159
00:06:33.63 --> 00:06:37.140
there's higher the biggest manufacturer

160
00:06:35.52 --> 00:06:39.090
of household appliances or cough koa

161
00:06:37.14 --> 00:06:40.920
company thus acquiring land all over the

162
00:06:39.09 --> 00:06:42.720
world like sugar cane plantations in

163
00:06:40.92 --> 00:06:44.790
Australia French vineyards or soy

164
00:06:42.72 --> 00:06:46.410
plantations in Brazil and then there's

165
00:06:44.79 --> 00:06:47.970
Guinea a car company which you might not

166
00:06:46.41 --> 00:06:51.720
have heard of but it actually bought out

167
00:06:47.97 --> 00:06:54.450
Volvo in 2010 yeah Volvo that legendary

168
00:06:51.72 --> 00:06:57.560
Swedish car company is now property of a

169
00:06:54.45 --> 00:06:57.560
Chinese company

170
00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.749
but if there is a sector where China is

171
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.270
really getting ahead

172
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:07.949
it is against all the odds the internet

173
00:07:06.27 --> 00:07:10.259
and I say against all odds here because

174
00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.479
as you probably know China is subject to

175
00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.759
complete control of its internet by the

176
00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:17.699
Chinese government with something known

177
00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:20.099
as the Great Firewall this blocks access

178
00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.689
to Facebook Google and The Economist to

179
00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.789
name just three however on the other

180
00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:26.249
hand in China it's pretty normal to do

181
00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:28.139
everything via apps for example when you

182
00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:29.879
visit China you rarely pay with credit

183
00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.339
cards the most common thing is to pay

184
00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:34.229
with a mobile phone using the app WeChat

185
00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:37.139
this is something of a super app that is

186
00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:41.639
like an all-in-one Facebook PayPal Gmail

187
00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:44.399
Twitter etc by the way we chat is also

188
00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:46.019
owned by 10 cent one of the top 15 most

189
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.119
valuable companies in the world which is

190
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:50.099
also the world's largest supplier of

191
00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:53.539
online games and one of the largest

192
00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.539
shareholders of Tesla

193
00:07:53.58 --> 00:07:58.830
so by now you are probably realizing

194
00:07:56.07 --> 00:08:01.140
that oh yes the Chinese they are

195
00:07:58.83 --> 00:08:03.660
everywhere as for another example of

196
00:08:01.14 --> 00:08:06.900
their success do consider Alibaba an

197
00:08:03.66 --> 00:08:10.110
e-commerce company that brings in 450

198
00:08:06.9 --> 00:08:12.870
billion dollars every year and in China

199
00:08:10.11 --> 00:08:17.310
alone this company has 400 million

200
00:08:12.87 --> 00:08:20.070
clients and well there's Napoleon said

201
00:08:17.31 --> 00:08:22.170
let's China sleep for when she wakes she

202
00:08:20.07 --> 00:08:23.940
will shake the world but before we all

203
00:08:22.17 --> 00:08:25.470
get scared just have a think about what

204
00:08:23.94 --> 00:08:27.600
it means it means more competition it

205
00:08:25.47 --> 00:08:30.000
means better prices better products and

206
00:08:27.6 --> 00:08:32.160
faster technological developments as

207
00:08:30.0 --> 00:08:34.530
consumers we can benefit a great deal

208
00:08:32.16 --> 00:08:36.540
from this transition now obviously it

209
00:08:34.53 --> 00:08:38.520
does have plenty of risks - or at least

210
00:08:36.54 --> 00:08:41.490
this is what US intelligence agencies

211
00:08:38.52 --> 00:08:42.960
are warning according to the house

212
00:08:41.49 --> 00:08:45.660
permanent Select Committee on

213
00:08:42.96 --> 00:08:48.750
Intelligence is report Chinese companies

214
00:08:45.66 --> 00:08:51.000
cannot be trusted to be free a foreign

215
00:08:48.75 --> 00:08:53.190
state influence and thus pose a security

216
00:08:51.0 --> 00:08:54.600
threat to the United States and to our

217
00:08:53.19 --> 00:08:55.890
systems and then there's the risk of

218
00:08:54.6 --> 00:08:57.270
companies which are going to have more

219
00:08:55.89 --> 00:08:58.380
and more competition although they're

220
00:08:57.27 --> 00:09:00.240
also going to have more and more

221
00:08:58.38 --> 00:09:01.860
opportunities - which we previously

222
00:09:00.24 --> 00:09:03.690
discussed in the video that we're

223
00:09:01.86 --> 00:09:05.700
linking to you on the screen now but

224
00:09:03.69 --> 00:09:07.740
let's not get too ahead of ourselves

225
00:09:05.7 --> 00:09:10.290
Chinese companies are still far behind

226
00:09:07.74 --> 00:09:16.200
in technological terms and they are in

227
00:09:10.29 --> 00:09:18.090
debt and well a great deal of it Chinese

228
00:09:16.2 --> 00:09:20.160
corporate debt levels are too high but

229
00:09:18.09 --> 00:09:23.850
it will take time to bring them down to

230
00:09:20.16 --> 00:09:25.230
more manageable levels and this this is

231
00:09:23.85 --> 00:09:27.630
not the end of it don't forget that

232
00:09:25.23 --> 00:09:29.490
China is a dictatorship and this means

233
00:09:27.63 --> 00:09:31.110
that the government has too much power

234
00:09:29.49 --> 00:09:32.850
when it comes to corporate decisions

235
00:09:31.11 --> 00:09:34.500
further the government's is pretty

236
00:09:32.85 --> 00:09:36.060
arbitrary and is really unpredictable

237
00:09:34.5 --> 00:09:38.160
for example a few years ago the

238
00:09:36.06 --> 00:09:40.350
government encouraged Chinese companies

239
00:09:38.16 --> 00:09:42.000
do try the international market and they

240
00:09:40.35 --> 00:09:43.710
would loan them as much money as they

241
00:09:42.0 --> 00:09:45.960
needed to do so but now they've decided

242
00:09:43.71 --> 00:09:47.880
they want to do the opposite if Chinese

243
00:09:45.96 --> 00:09:49.980
company wants to buy out a foreign

244
00:09:47.88 --> 00:09:51.900
company they need the approval of the

245
00:09:49.98 --> 00:09:54.210
Chinese Communist Party and there are

246
00:09:51.9 --> 00:09:55.710
new tough limitations on money leaving

247
00:09:54.21 --> 00:09:57.090
the country further to that we have to

248
00:09:55.71 --> 00:09:59.070
mention the censorship the legal

249
00:09:57.09 --> 00:10:01.620
uncertainty trade obstacles and the bad

250
00:09:59.07 --> 00:10:04.470
reputation of Chinese products and so on

251
00:10:01.62 --> 00:10:06.840
and so forth so we can say that right

252
00:10:04.47 --> 00:10:09.210
now the United States's position as Lee

253
00:10:06.84 --> 00:10:11.040
is not in particular danger unless

254
00:10:09.21 --> 00:10:13.530
something changes that is more dramatic

255
00:10:11.04 --> 00:10:16.050
than we are currently seeing long-term

256
00:10:13.53 --> 00:10:17.790
though well who knows so I really hope

257
