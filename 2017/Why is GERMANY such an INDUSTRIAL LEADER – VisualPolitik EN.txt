1
00:00:00.0 --> 00:00:12.809
ah Germany is the place where BMW

2
00:00:09.96 --> 00:00:18.810
Ramstein and fkk that's nudist culture

3
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.820
were born nevertheless Germany has

4
00:00:18.81 --> 00:00:22.920
something even more important than all

5
00:00:20.82 --> 00:00:25.230
of these things and that is the fact

6
00:00:22.92 --> 00:00:26.369
that it is the world's ultimate Factory

7
00:00:25.23 --> 00:00:27.840
yep you heard that right

8
00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.550
and I can guess what you probably

9
00:00:27.84 --> 00:00:31.800
thinking right now wait a minute Simon

10
00:00:29.55 --> 00:00:34.260
isn't another country where TV screens

11
00:00:31.8 --> 00:00:37.340
mobile phones and well practically every

12
00:00:34.26 --> 00:00:37.340
good Under the Sun is made

13
00:00:38.96 --> 00:00:42.570
[Music]

14
00:00:40.8 --> 00:00:44.820
well the thing is that's not entirely

15
00:00:42.57 --> 00:00:46.740
true now of course China does lead the

16
00:00:44.82 --> 00:00:48.180
charge when it comes to exports but do

17
00:00:46.74 --> 00:00:50.400
you know what in order to manufacture

18
00:00:48.18 --> 00:00:52.500
all of those products they need to

19
00:00:50.4 --> 00:00:55.590
import a lot of things from abroad

20
00:00:52.5 --> 00:00:57.660
Germany instead sells way more than what

21
00:00:55.59 --> 00:00:58.920
it buys in fact one out of every ten

22
00:00:57.66 --> 00:01:01.650
products sold on the international

23
00:00:58.92 --> 00:01:04.410
market is made in this country which has

24
00:01:01.65 --> 00:01:09.960
a population 15 times that smaller than

25
00:01:04.41 --> 00:01:11.970
China yes we all know those big German

26
00:01:09.96 --> 00:01:14.670
car companies like BMW Audi or

27
00:01:11.97 --> 00:01:16.440
Volkswagen but there is way more than

28
00:01:14.67 --> 00:01:18.390
that if you don't believe me well just

29
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:19.890
consider your mobile phone and I know I

30
00:01:18.39 --> 00:01:21.300
know on the back is gonna say something

31
00:01:19.89 --> 00:01:24.509
like assembled in the People's Republic

32
00:01:21.3 --> 00:01:26.460
of China but I'm not talking about this

33
00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.740
I'm talking about if you open up that

34
00:01:26.46 --> 00:01:30.960
phone you're going to find a bunch of

35
00:01:28.74 --> 00:01:32.580
microchips inside as an example here

36
00:01:30.96 --> 00:01:33.780
that chip that makes your phone tilt you

37
00:01:32.58 --> 00:01:35.850
know when you rotate it and the screen

38
00:01:33.78 --> 00:01:37.950
matches up that's probably most likely

39
00:01:35.85 --> 00:01:40.470
made by a German company called Bosch

40
00:01:37.95 --> 00:01:42.180
sensitive but not only that many of the

41
00:01:40.47 --> 00:01:44.310
robots used inside these Chinese

42
00:01:42.18 --> 00:01:47.869
factories assembling these phones are

43
00:01:44.31 --> 00:01:47.869
probably made in Germany

44
00:01:48.85 --> 00:01:52.610
[Music]

45
00:01:50.56 --> 00:01:54.440
in other words in Germany they

46
00:01:52.61 --> 00:01:56.180
manufacture the things they go inside of

47
00:01:54.44 --> 00:01:58.370
other things that are manufactured by

48
00:01:56.18 --> 00:02:00.080
things that are made in Germany and now

49
00:01:58.37 --> 00:02:01.910
you might be wondering how is any of

50
00:02:00.08 --> 00:02:03.290
that possible I mean factories they

51
00:02:01.91 --> 00:02:05.240
should be built in places with cheap

52
00:02:03.29 --> 00:02:07.040
labor costs right I mean how is it

53
00:02:05.24 --> 00:02:09.440
possible that Germany with relatively

54
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:11.000
high salaries is such an industrial

55
00:02:09.44 --> 00:02:12.170
powerhouse well the good news is that

56
00:02:11.0 --> 00:02:14.180
today we're going to answer that

57
00:02:12.17 --> 00:02:15.740
question for you but as always before we

58
00:02:14.18 --> 00:02:26.480
get into all of that let's take a look

59
00:02:15.74 --> 00:02:28.340
back at the history after World War 2

60
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:30.110
Europe was pretty dumb destroyed

61
00:02:28.34 --> 00:02:32.060
countries like Italy France Western

62
00:02:30.11 --> 00:02:34.370
Germany which was the capitalist side of

63
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:39.290
Germany they got a massive money grants

64
00:02:34.37 --> 00:02:40.970
from their good friend Uncle Sam but

65
00:02:39.29 --> 00:02:43.190
wait just a minute because each of these

66
00:02:40.97 --> 00:02:45.020
countries used that money in totally

67
00:02:43.19 --> 00:02:46.880
different ways the french president for

68
00:02:45.02 --> 00:02:50.950
instance was this guy that you'd see on

69
00:02:46.88 --> 00:02:50.950
TV general charles they go

70
00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.989
de Gaulle came from the military it was

71
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.209
no friend of private companies his

72
00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.280
political Creed the so called des rêves

73
00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.719
ma was about nationalizing big

74
00:03:00.28 --> 00:03:05.380
businesses and leading the whole

75
00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:07.120
country's economy as if it was an army

76
00:03:05.38 --> 00:03:09.409
[Music]

77
00:03:07.12 --> 00:03:11.060
well in western Germany they chose a

78
00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.859
totally different path both the

79
00:03:11.06 --> 00:03:15.260
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in his

80
00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.359
Finance Minister Ludvig Earhart spent

81
00:03:15.26 --> 00:03:19.249
years thinking about their own economic

82
00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.049
system it was a mixture between the

83
00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.120
competition of free-market capitalism

84
00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.040
and the safety nets provided by the

85
00:03:23.12 --> 00:03:26.719
government they then decided to give

86
00:03:25.04 --> 00:03:28.459
this system what is probably the worst

87
00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.400
name in the world ever beiie called it

88
00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.889
auto liberalism or social market economy

89
00:03:31.4 --> 00:03:35.299
[Music]

90
00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.090
competition is the most promising means

91
00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.889
to achieve and secure prosperity ludwig

92
00:03:38.09 --> 00:03:41.900
erhard in other words while de Gaulle

93
00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.969
centralized the economy in Paris Konrad

94
00:03:41.9 --> 00:03:45.859
Adenauer designed a system where the

95
00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.230
government would put into place a set of

96
00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.549
conditions but the players would make

97
00:03:48.23 --> 00:03:51.260
their own decisions

98
00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.060
this explains why in Germany trade

99
00:03:51.26 --> 00:03:57.129
unions regional governments and of

100
00:03:53.06 --> 00:03:57.129
course companies are quite so importance

101
00:03:59.8 --> 00:04:03.010
and so now you might be wondering what

102
00:04:01.54 --> 00:04:05.290
are the keys that are needed for a

103
00:04:03.01 --> 00:04:07.210
system like this to work and well has it

104
00:04:05.29 --> 00:04:12.070
really worked out at all well let's get

105
00:04:07.21 --> 00:04:13.450
right into that a stable currency I'm

106
00:04:12.07 --> 00:04:15.370
pretty sure at some point you've had

107
00:04:13.45 --> 00:04:17.770
some economists saying that devaluing

108
00:04:15.37 --> 00:04:19.300
your currency boost exports right for

109
00:04:17.77 --> 00:04:21.400
instance imagine we have a shoe

110
00:04:19.3 --> 00:04:22.870
manufacturing facility in Mexico and we

111
00:04:21.4 --> 00:04:24.520
want to sell a pair of shoes to the

112
00:04:22.87 --> 00:04:26.470
American market let's say the price of

113
00:04:24.52 --> 00:04:28.450
these shoes is 2,000 New Mexican pesos

114
00:04:26.47 --> 00:04:31.600
at the time of making this video those

115
00:04:28.45 --> 00:04:33.450
2,000 pesos is equal to about 110 US

116
00:04:31.6 --> 00:04:35.910
dollars

117
00:04:33.45 --> 00:04:37.800
let's say that all the sudden Mexican

118
00:04:35.91 --> 00:04:39.900
Central Bank decides to print money and

119
00:04:37.8 --> 00:04:41.430
therefore it devalue its currency from

120
00:04:39.9 --> 00:04:43.500
one day to the next the pair of shoes

121
00:04:41.43 --> 00:04:45.330
could be worth 90 US dollars therefore

122
00:04:43.5 --> 00:04:47.310
it would be easier to sell these shoes

123
00:04:45.33 --> 00:04:49.440
abroad now this is a theory that's

124
00:04:47.31 --> 00:04:51.090
actually supported by most governments

125
00:04:49.44 --> 00:04:53.280
today now the Germans they actually

126
00:04:51.09 --> 00:04:55.140
decided to do the exact opposite and for

127
00:04:53.28 --> 00:04:56.760
the later part of the 20th century the

128
00:04:55.14 --> 00:05:01.070
German mark was actually one of the most

129
00:04:56.76 --> 00:05:03.840
stable currencies in the entire world

130
00:05:01.07 --> 00:05:05.520
and this might lead you to wonder well

131
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:07.950
how is it possible that Germany could

132
00:05:05.52 --> 00:05:09.870
export so much when their products were

133
00:05:07.95 --> 00:05:11.610
not actually that cheap all right well

134
00:05:09.87 --> 00:05:13.080
let's go back to our shoes example for

135
00:05:11.61 --> 00:05:14.370
just a moment but actually this time I'm

136
00:05:13.08 --> 00:05:16.380
going to tell you the story of a real

137
00:05:14.37 --> 00:05:22.470
company this is a company from the north

138
00:05:16.38 --> 00:05:23.790
of Germany and it's called ESMA it's not

139
00:05:22.47 --> 00:05:25.860
a particularly big business it has

140
00:05:23.79 --> 00:05:27.420
around 200 staff now this company

141
00:05:25.86 --> 00:05:29.940
started right after the war being

142
00:05:27.42 --> 00:05:31.890
founded in 1946 and they specialized in

143
00:05:29.94 --> 00:05:33.900
making machines for shoe manufacturing

144
00:05:31.89 --> 00:05:36.270
now in order to do this they needed to

145
00:05:33.9 --> 00:05:37.860
import lots of machines from the United

146
00:05:36.27 --> 00:05:39.900
States and thanks to having a stable

147
00:05:37.86 --> 00:05:42.270
currency the price for importing those

148
00:05:39.9 --> 00:05:43.890
machines it was relatively low they then

149
00:05:42.27 --> 00:05:45.240
decided to rent a facility because at

150
00:05:43.89 --> 00:05:47.550
the end of the day since there was no

151
00:05:45.24 --> 00:05:50.010
inflation rents would not go up and they

152
00:05:47.55 --> 00:05:52.970
could calculate the future cost of this

153
00:05:50.01 --> 00:05:52.970
space reliably

154
00:05:55.12 --> 00:05:59.139
but it wasn't only that since German

155
00:05:57.34 --> 00:06:02.020
companies couldn't offer lower prices

156
00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.060
Desna had to innovate and in 1960 they

157
00:06:02.02 --> 00:06:05.740
invested in state-of-the-art

158
00:06:03.06 --> 00:06:10.300
technologies to manufacture rubber sole

159
00:06:05.74 --> 00:06:12.940
shoes ten years later decima was the

160
00:06:10.3 --> 00:06:14.110
world leader in PVC soles it's in fact

161
00:06:12.94 --> 00:06:16.030
likely that these soles of the shoes

162
00:06:14.11 --> 00:06:18.580
you're wearing right now are made by a

163
00:06:16.03 --> 00:06:20.889
decimal machine this company with 200

164
00:06:18.58 --> 00:06:22.500
staff now sells to every country in the

165
00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.639
world including China

166
00:06:22.5 --> 00:06:25.639
[Music]

167
00:06:25.87 --> 00:06:30.980
and you know this is just one example of

168
00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.380
the thousands of small and medium-sized

169
00:06:30.98 --> 00:06:35.960
companies the so-called middle stand

170
00:06:33.38 --> 00:06:38.449
vertebra dark Germany the middle stands

171
00:06:35.96 --> 00:06:40.850
success has attracted admiring glances

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.979
from the rest of Europe but it's built

173
00:06:40.85 --> 00:06:45.410
on foundations that may be hard to copy

174
00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.270
and yes I know I know the German mark is

175
00:06:45.41 --> 00:06:49.340
a thing of the past because in 2008 the

176
00:06:47.27 --> 00:06:52.430
Germans they abandoned this currency and

177
00:06:49.34 --> 00:06:54.260
they adopted the euro but think about it

178
00:06:52.43 --> 00:06:55.669
while other countries like Spain they

179
00:06:54.26 --> 00:06:58.250
were using weaker countries before

180
00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:03.410
Germany had had a strong currency for

181
00:06:58.25 --> 00:07:05.240
decades that means that in 2002 German

182
00:07:03.41 --> 00:07:07.760
companies were already more competitive

183
00:07:05.24 --> 00:07:09.050
than anyone elses but again hold on a

184
00:07:07.76 --> 00:07:11.090
minute because there's many other things

185
00:07:09.05 --> 00:07:15.370
that can explain the success of the

186
00:07:11.09 --> 00:07:15.370
German model so let's dig into these now

187
00:07:15.4 --> 00:07:19.550
the educational system now I can

188
00:07:18.62 --> 00:07:21.200
probably guess what you're gonna say

189
00:07:19.55 --> 00:07:23.000
come on Simon Germany isn't really

190
00:07:21.2 --> 00:07:24.979
famous for its educational system is it

191
00:07:23.0 --> 00:07:26.120
and to some extent that's right if you

192
00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:27.919
look at the piece of report Germany

193
00:07:26.12 --> 00:07:29.900
isn't even ranking inside the top ten

194
00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:31.760
but then again German students managed

195
00:07:29.9 --> 00:07:33.950
to find a job right after they finished

196
00:07:31.76 --> 00:07:35.600
their studies so we've not such a great

197
00:07:33.95 --> 00:07:39.500
educational system world why is this

198
00:07:35.6 --> 00:07:41.150
happening well the answers of that

199
00:07:39.5 --> 00:07:43.250
actually lies in their vocational

200
00:07:41.15 --> 00:07:44.599
training system now let's imagine you're

201
00:07:43.25 --> 00:07:46.340
a high school students in Germany and

202
00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:48.590
you don't want to go to university so

203
00:07:46.34 --> 00:07:50.870
instead you decide to study to become a

204
00:07:48.59 --> 00:07:52.370
plumber well from the first moments

205
00:07:50.87 --> 00:07:54.169
you're already going to be working for a

206
00:07:52.37 --> 00:07:55.940
company which has an arrangement with

207
00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:57.710
the school this means from monday to

208
00:07:55.94 --> 00:07:59.210
wednesday you go to a classroom and from

209
00:07:57.71 --> 00:08:00.810
thursday to friday you go to the

210
00:07:59.21 --> 00:08:03.110
company's workshop

211
00:08:00.81 --> 00:08:05.280
[Music]

212
00:08:03.11 --> 00:08:07.230
there you would be trained by the

213
00:08:05.28 --> 00:08:10.170
experienced plumbers and you would get a

214
00:08:07.23 --> 00:08:11.790
salary of between 300 to $500 a month

215
00:08:10.17 --> 00:08:13.470
and this salary is actually pretty

216
00:08:11.79 --> 00:08:15.690
important because it means that the

217
00:08:13.47 --> 00:08:17.640
company that are paying you really want

218
00:08:15.69 --> 00:08:19.200
to make you work I mean otherwise the

219
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:19.980
firm's pretty much just throwing money

220
00:08:19.2 --> 00:08:23.520
away

221
00:08:19.98 --> 00:08:25.349
[Music]

222
00:08:23.52 --> 00:08:27.750
and the outcome of this is that German

223
00:08:25.349 --> 00:08:30.330
students know how it is to be in a real

224
00:08:27.75 --> 00:08:31.800
life working environment in fact many of

225
00:08:30.33 --> 00:08:33.510
them actually remain in the company

226
00:08:31.8 --> 00:08:35.399
where they did their training and of

227
00:08:33.51 --> 00:08:37.620
course those German firms in exchange

228
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:38.969
they get well trained workers and now

229
00:08:37.62 --> 00:08:41.159
they're on the subject of workers let's

230
00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:43.789
move on to another key piece of the

231
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.789
German system

232
00:08:44.41 --> 00:08:49.370
German trade unions in other countries

233
00:08:47.33 --> 00:08:51.110
like France or Spain most of the labor

234
00:08:49.37 --> 00:08:53.180
laws are made by Parliament's but that's

235
00:08:51.11 --> 00:08:55.100
not the case in Germany until 2015

236
00:08:53.18 --> 00:08:57.440
Germans didn't even have a minimum wage

237
00:08:55.1 --> 00:08:59.720
salaries were negotiated by trade unions

238
00:08:57.44 --> 00:09:01.280
and employers in Germany syndicates are

239
00:08:59.72 --> 00:09:03.770
extremely important actually those big

240
00:09:01.28 --> 00:09:05.930
companies like Audi or BMW with more

241
00:09:03.77 --> 00:09:07.730
than 2000 workers are required to have

242
00:09:05.93 --> 00:09:08.540
union representatives on their

243
00:09:07.73 --> 00:09:10.770
Administrative Board

244
00:09:08.54 --> 00:09:13.380
[Music]

245
00:09:10.77 --> 00:09:14.760
consider this Siemens has 10 shareholder

246
00:09:13.38 --> 00:09:16.709
representatives on their board and

247
00:09:14.76 --> 00:09:18.600
therefore they must have 10 people

248
00:09:16.709 --> 00:09:20.490
representing the workers remember this

249
00:09:18.6 --> 00:09:21.750
one because it makes a big difference in

250
00:09:20.49 --> 00:09:23.850
Spain there's an example of another

251
00:09:21.75 --> 00:09:26.250
country a big company like telefónica

252
00:09:23.85 --> 00:09:28.020
has no trade union representatives on

253
00:09:26.25 --> 00:09:29.760
their board of administration trade

254
00:09:28.02 --> 00:09:32.190
unions can only participate in another

255
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:34.110
body which is called the Company Council

256
00:09:32.19 --> 00:09:35.910
and they can only speak about matters

257
00:09:34.11 --> 00:09:38.250
that affect salaries or working

258
00:09:35.91 --> 00:09:40.170
conditions now but contrast in Germany

259
00:09:38.25 --> 00:09:41.850
trade unions have a voice on every

260
00:09:40.17 --> 00:09:43.770
decision that the company makes when

261
00:09:41.85 --> 00:09:45.810
Siemens wants to start operating in a

262
00:09:43.77 --> 00:09:47.490
new market or launch a new product they

263
00:09:45.81 --> 00:09:49.470
have to ask the shareholders of course

264
00:09:47.49 --> 00:09:52.580
but they also have to ask their trade

265
00:09:49.47 --> 00:09:52.580
union representatives

266
00:09:55.08 --> 00:09:58.650
now you might be wondering isn't this

267
00:09:56.79 --> 00:10:00.030
just bad news for the company I mean we

268
00:09:58.65 --> 00:10:02.250
pretty much take it for granted that

269
00:10:00.03 --> 00:10:04.050
unions and companies not exactly best

270
00:10:02.25 --> 00:10:05.940
friends well it doesn't actually have to

271
00:10:04.05 --> 00:10:08.370
be their way think about it for a moment

272
00:10:05.94 --> 00:10:10.650
thanks to this setup Siemens and BMWs

273
00:10:08.37 --> 00:10:12.450
workers they know whether a company is

274
00:10:10.65 --> 00:10:14.160
doing well or whether they're losing

275
00:10:12.45 --> 00:10:15.870
money and of course when things are

276
00:10:14.16 --> 00:10:18.030
going bad for the company they can make

277
00:10:15.87 --> 00:10:22.920
compromises like reducing their working

278
00:10:18.03 --> 00:10:25.380
hours instead of being fired to cut

279
00:10:22.92 --> 00:10:27.240
working hours at German facilities this

280
00:10:25.38 --> 00:10:29.790
explains why during the financial crisis

281
00:10:27.24 --> 00:10:31.260
of 2008 German companies didn't fire a

282
00:10:29.79 --> 00:10:33.090
large number of people

283
00:10:31.26 --> 00:10:37.920
hence well this is good for the workers

284
00:10:33.09 --> 00:10:39.270
and it's good for the company but wait a

285
00:10:37.92 --> 00:10:40.770
minute because I know what you're

286
00:10:39.27 --> 00:10:42.540
thinking right now those German trade

287
00:10:40.77 --> 00:10:44.370
unions are collaborating with big

288
00:10:42.54 --> 00:10:46.140
capitalists in order to exploit the

289
00:10:44.37 --> 00:10:47.520
workers rights rise I mean it must be

290
00:10:46.14 --> 00:10:50.310
happening well the answer there's

291
00:10:47.52 --> 00:10:52.200
actually certainly not the reality is

292
00:10:50.31 --> 00:10:54.480
that the average wage in Germany is

293
00:10:52.2 --> 00:10:56.310
around 34 hundred US dollars a month

294
00:10:54.48 --> 00:10:57.780
that's higher than the state of New York

295
00:10:56.31 --> 00:10:59.520
and that's in a country with a pretty

296
00:10:57.78 --> 00:11:01.470
affordable cost of living a flat in

297
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:03.900
Berlin is about half the price of a flat

298
00:11:01.47 --> 00:11:05.370
in New York City and despite all of this

299
00:11:03.9 --> 00:11:07.560
Germany maintains its position as the

300
00:11:05.37 --> 00:11:10.130
third biggest country when it comes to

301
00:11:07.56 --> 00:11:10.130
exports

302
00:11:10.68 --> 00:11:13.769
so now the question becomes do you think

303
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:15.449
your country could benefit from the

304
00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:17.220
German model or perhaps you think these

305
00:11:15.449 --> 00:11:19.410
policies are impossible to implement

306
00:11:17.22 --> 00:11:21.449
