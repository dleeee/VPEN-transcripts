it may seem hard may almost impossible

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,210
to believe given its current

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,820
circumstances but once actually not so

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,760
long ago Venezuela was the envy of Latin

00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,770
we've talked a lot about current-day

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,270
than as whaler on this channel we told

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,160
you what's happening why it's happening

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,809
and even some of the things that may

13
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,880
happen in the future and I think that

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,890
what's happening today is very clear to

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,610
all of us

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,989
after almost 20 years of the Bolivarian

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,690
revolution Venezuela is a devastated

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,370
country a country suffering a brutal

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,650
economic crisis as well as food and

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,900
medicine shortages and increasing

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,480
insecurity

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,610
it's something that logically has forced

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,380
millions of Venezuelans to leave in

24
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,600
search of a better life Venezuela is

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,150
going through a huge humanitarian crisis

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,100
but hold on just a moment because it

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,810
wasn't always like that as I said once

28
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,670
not so long ago Venezuela it was a

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,230
prosperous country a country to which

30
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,760
many people emigrated in search of

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,380
greater opportunity if you want to learn

32
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,670

prosperous Venezuela as you all know by

36
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,450
now Venezuela has the largest known

37
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,400
conventional oil reserves on the planet

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,810
we're talking about more than 300

39
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,130
billion barrels of oil here yes there

40
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,450
it's quality might not be the best

41
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,460
Venezuela has more oil than all over

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,800
Russia or Saudi Arabia and it's not just

43
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,630
oil many many other natural resources

44
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,630
allocated in Venezuela as well

45
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,190
Venezuela is a very rich country that

46
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,550
has everything iron oil gold diamond gas

47
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,759
and a gang of criminals took it Jose

48
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,729
Luis Rodriguez el Puma Venezuelan actor

49
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,800
and singer well the fact is that there

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,990
was a time when Venezuelans did know how

51
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,120
to take advantage of this huge fortune

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,050
I'm referring to the 1970s

53
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:34,860
[Music]

54
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,299
you see at that time in Venezuela things

55
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:41,459
were going smoothly and full steam ahead

56
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,049
things were going so well the Venezuelan

57
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,180
tourists were known as they give me to

58
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,040
people because they'd enter a store and

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,140
just buy everything sort of her how much

60
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,030
is that there doesn't matter I'll take

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,180
two and folks in those years

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,980
not only was Venezuela a well-off

63
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,690
country but more importantly its

64
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,400
citizens were also making money

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,760
[Music]

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,500
that's how a thriving middle class

67
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,019
emerged unemployment was at only 4% and

68
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,269
thousands and thousands of kilometres of

69
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:15,519
new roads were built every year poverty

70
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,970
which now affects 9 out of every 10

71
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,150
Venezuelans didn't even exceed 20%

72
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,430
those were the happy times there was so

73
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,319
much excess that for example traveling

74
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,330
to Miami became the common pastime among

75
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,390
the middle class well daddy mommy we're

76
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,209
here in the United States and daddy is

77
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,849
down here in Venezuela that's where

78
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,799
daddy is working Jeff and when he finds

79
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,720
a place for us to live we are going down

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,680
there too and you know where one could

81
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,690
find the best and most expensive French

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,760
restaurants in the entire region oh yeah

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,810
I was in Caracas

84
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,310
what's more Venezuelans became the

85
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,349
largest whiskey consumers in the entire

86
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:00,069
world

87
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,569
yep you heard all of their correctly

88
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,430
back then it seems like this country was

89
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,320
gonna take over the world

90
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,200
go to you game or year

[Music]

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,220
in fact back then unlike what's

93
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,079
happening today Venezuela became a mecca

94
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
for thousands and thousands of Latin

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,590
American immigrants everyone who wanted

96
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,050
to experience Venezuela's prosperity and

97
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,580
thanks to a democratic system that

98
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,680
worked Venezuela also became a refuge

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,510
for many exiled from Pinochet's Chile

100
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,950
and the military hunters of Argentina

101
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,970
[Music]

102
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,610
however clearly one day that bonanza it

103
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,710
certainly ended so the two questions we

104
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,570
can ask ourselves are how did Venezuela

105
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,180
become such a prosperous country and why

106
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,770
does everything end well let's see

107
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,930
the land of oil

108
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,940
thanks to natural resources to

109
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,800
institutions that works even if it

110
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,180
wasn't quite Switzerland sand to a

111
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,009
relatively well educated population

112
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,750
Venezuela was traditionally one of the

113
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,580
most prosperous countries in Latin

114
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,449
America Venezuela was as rich as Norway

115
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,850
in the 60s however what happened in the

116
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,400
70s went much further here's a question

117
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,410
can you think of any big political news

118
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,409
from the year 1973

119
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,569
well in October of that year the Arab

120
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,889
countries that belong to OPEC the

121
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,539
Organization of Petroleum Exporting

122
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,399
Countries decided to punish the

123
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,110
countries that had supported Israel in

124
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:47,100
the Yom Kippur War

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,230
well at least that was their official

126
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,060
excuse but it's also true that these

127
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,650
countries have been negotiating with all

128
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,870
companies for years to increase their

129
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,240
country's income and those negotiations

130
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,070
is there and gotten them anywhere and

131
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,690
say you know what they decided to do

132
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,030
they blocked their oil exports to all

133
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,710
those countries that had supported

134
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,660
Israel this included the United States

135
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,719
and much of Western Europe

136
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,849
to give you a better idea this action

137
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,279
led to a huge cut in the world's oil

138
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,229
production this was a cut that hit the

139
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:21,329
global market with enormous force and it

140
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,339
did it practically overnight the effect

141
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,199
was immediate within a short time the

142
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,879
price of an oil barrel went for

143
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,559
approximately one dollar and sixty cents

144
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,259
to almost $10 overnight oil-producing

145
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,520
countries became rich

146
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,620
as you might know Venezuela it might

147
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,479
lack some things but they have as much

148
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,759
oil as they could ever need well today

149
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,319
they still have the oil but maduras

150
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,240
government's can't extract it which is

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,060
like basically having none at all

[Music]

153
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,509
the fact is this country was one of the

154
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,639
great beneficiaries of the 1973 oil

155
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,710
crisis suddenly not only at the price

156
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,509
risen but all Western powers were

157
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,740
sticking to Venezuelan oil as well

the venezuela was a much much safer

161
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,030
supplier and that's really how

162
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,350
petrodollars started raining in

163
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,300
venezuela like there was no tomorrow and

164
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,000
in 1975 President Carlos andreas Perez

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,250
decided to nationalize all the oil and

166
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,160
created PDVSA the Venezuelan state-owned

167
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:36,740
oil and gas company from that moment

168
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,780
most of the petrodollar reign ended up

169
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,880
in the state's coffers and of course

170
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
they began to spend it like there was no

171
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,740
tomorrow

172
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,290
those were the crazy years in Venezuela

173
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,720
in 1977 the practical Venezuelan per

174
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,970
capita income was twice that of the rest

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,870

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,980

Liz Bonanza was mainly caused by the

182
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,230
huge amounts of petrol dollars that

183
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,740
began to flood into Venezuela Venezuela

184
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,930
was a very successful country precisely

185
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,000
because of the oil rent which lasted

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,880
until the 1970s this income allowed the

187
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,620
country to finance its services

with the oil money a policy was launched

207
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,930
that opted to close the Venezuelan

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,389
economy set high tariffs and restrict

209
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:12,889
competition by developing local

210
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:14,720
industries that could create substitutes

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,889
for imports and this is what's known as

212
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,410
an import substitution industrialization

213
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,139
