[Music]

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,929
Mexico is in fashion in Hollywood while

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,820
Donald Trump keeps trying to build the

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,440
wall at the southern border Mexican

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,450
movie directors have won five out of the

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,850
past six Oscars for Best Director

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,830
but as talented as Mexicans are in the

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,630
film industry they are far less lucky

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,020
when it comes to politics

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,800
[Music]

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,110
a year ago we told you how the country

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,850
of guillermo del toro ended up having

14
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,490
years of bipartisan politics that led to

15
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,140
rampant corruption for a better

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,520
understanding the country's latest

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,160
presidents on recap union yet to left

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,900
office with the worst ratings any

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,480
Mexican president has ever had and this

20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,190
is how the new president began his term

21
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,720
of course we're talking about Andres

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,570
Manuel Lopez Obrador also known as an lo

23
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,360
the New Mexican left-wing rock star is

24
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,250
the first president to win more than 30

25
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,500
million votes that's a landslide victory

26
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,989
and it's even more surprising if we take

27
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,340
into account that he didn't come from

28
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,630
either of the two major political

29
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:08,560
parties Mexicans wanted a radical change

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,080
and that's exactly what amlo promised

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,140
the question is now is he delivering and

32
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,330
Eric is gonna give us the answer truth

33
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,790
be told yes things are changing in

34
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,649
Mexico and they're changing for the

35
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,560
worse the GDP growth rate was 2% in 2018

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,020
but in 2019 they're only projected to

37
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,050
grow about 0.2% yes so far it seems like

38
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,060
Mexico is heading towards a recession

39
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,130
and yes yes I know what you're thinking

40
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,929
come on Simon the brand-new Mexican

41
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,250
president hasn't even been in office for

42
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,679
a year we really blame them for what's

43
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,420
going on in the country well today we

44
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,920
are going to answer this question but

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,440
before we do let's take a look back at

46
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,990
the history

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,850
the revenant yes I'm sure many of you

48
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,079
have watched the movie the revenant the

49
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,939
Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez

50
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:55,479
Inarritu

51
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,549
won his second Oscar for Best Director

52
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,740
with that film but the real revenant in

53
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,539
this story is an lo he started his

54
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,159
career as a member of one of those two

55
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,189
big Mexican political parties the

56
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,539
Institutional Revolutionary Party also

57
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,640
known as the PRI this used to be the

58
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,640
country's big center-left party but AMLO

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,160
soon realized that this party wasn't far

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,930
enough so I left with him so he created

61
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,970
his own spin-off that led him to become

62
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,319
mayor of Mexico City

63
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,450
this is how amlo became famous

64
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,700
nationwide then in 2006 he ran for

65
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,150
president but lost by 250,000 votes

66
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,439
instead of accepting these results Amla

67
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,150
started several protests and his

68
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,980
supporters claims that he was the

69
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,840
legitimate president then he ran again

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,540
for president in 2012 with even worse

71
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,639
results at the time it really looked as

72
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,959
if his career was over

73
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,939
yes nobody would invest a penny in

74
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,310
amylose future but then against the odds

75
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,189
he rose from the ashes with a brand new

76
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:53,799
political party arena his program was

77
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,629
very simple destroy everything the

78
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,159
previous administrations had done in

79
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,860
Mexico and start from scratch

80
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,260
[Music]

81
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,450
hands well boy in a country so

82
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,670
politically dysfunctional and corrupt

83
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,129
and poverty-stricken as Mexico this

84
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,049
formula couldn't have worked better

85
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,849
let's be honest here an low isn't

86
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,470
disappointing anyone you see in Mexico

87
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,569
after winning the elections you have to

88
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,010
wait five months before you really start

89
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,260
being president during this time they

90
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,390
would be president just wait but Ann

91
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,159
will use this five months to hold lots

92
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,409
of referendums his idea was that as soon

93
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,030
as he started his term he would already

94
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,280
have a list of popular policies ready to

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,230
be implemented and so now you might say

96
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,939
well that doesn't sound like such a bad

97
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:38,129
idea I mean you guys official policy

98
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,510
you've already praised direct democracy

99
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,220
in countries like Liechtenstein and

100
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,379
Switzerland so I mean you're gonna be

101
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,840
back am like that's right

102
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,030
[Music]

103
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,310
and yes you're right referendums can be

104
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,870
pretty cool but they must have

105
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,970
guarantees and be organized by the

106
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,710
government when a political party

107
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,660
organizes referendums by themselves

108
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,820
without any controls it's usually a bit

109
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,160
of a joke and well this is exactly what

110
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,780
AMLO has been doing for most of these

111
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,640
referendums only about one in five

112
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,920
municipalities actually had voting

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,350
cabins and the elections they were so

114
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,900
rigs this oh well I mean just look at

115
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,109
this person could vote four times on the

116
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,090
referendum about the new airport but

117
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,070
this is not the end of the story you see

118
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,900
when we talk about referendums the way

119
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,150
we right the question can have a huge

120
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,250
impact on the outcome in other words if

121
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,990
you change the wording you can easily

122
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,210
manipulate the result for example if I

123
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,950
ask do you agree with increasing old

124
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,840
people's pensions or do you want a

125
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,610
better healthcare system well most of

126
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,919
you are going to say yes and these are

127
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,390
the sorts of questions that the morena

128
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,910
party was asking so how many citizens

129
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,830
voted while most of the referendums had

130
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,440
a turnout of less than 1% about equal to

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,870
the percentage of absolute diehard and

132
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,760
low supporters and of course all these

133
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,710
policies at more than 90 percent

134
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:03,940
approval ratings

135
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,100
of course none of these referendums had

136
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,290
any legal binding but they have been the

137
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,660
perfect wave and low to justify all of

138
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,190
his decisions at the end of the day I

139
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,870
mean he's just doing what citizens want

140
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,420
right so now you might be wondering what

141
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,220
kind of decisions is ambling making

142
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,750
where is an example canceling the

143
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,850
construction of Mexico City's new

144
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,620
International Airport we don't know if

145
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,180
the project was good or bad but the

146
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,950
truth is that it costs thirteen billion

147
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,020
dollars of which five billion were

148
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,980
already spent

149
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,170
so basically Mexico is just thrown five

150
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,270
billion US dollars out of the window and

151
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,040
now you might be wondering well why did

152
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,840
he do that that's easy one of those

153
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,370
referendums are only 1% of the

154
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,290
population voted said that the public

155
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,360
agreed with canceling construction

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,070
anyway you can argue that many other

157
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,530
politicians base their policies on polls

158
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,940
but the difference is that

159
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,430
amlo sees this as a real legal

160
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,960
instrument going to govern like this

161
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,900
asking the people they say that in order

162
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,360
to make mistakes the best policy is to

163
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
ask this is democracy it's not the

164
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,260
decision of one man or two or three

165
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,370
again the problem is not making

166
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,170
referendums in fact a Mexican law

167
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,210
already has legislation in place to

168
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,090
regulate how to make popular

169
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,220
consultations but of course you need an

170
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,410
independent body to run the process and

171
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,510
you need to reach a certain turnout

172
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,600
until this year 2019 this turnout was 40

173
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
percent of voters but of course them

174
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,830
Loeb has already changed this now 25

175
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,840
percent is enough twenty-five percent of

176
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
Mexican voters is around twenty million

177
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,040
people but there are consultations in

178
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,990
which less than 1 million people voted

179
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,120
in other words for AMLO direct democracy

180
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,390
is pretty undemocratic but wait a minute

181
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,160
because we aren't done yet porphyrin

182
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,200
consultations what does AMLO done in the

183
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,150
few months since he's been in power well

184
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,100
he's been pretty busy check it out

185
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,220
mmm low world avenues presidency can be

186
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,800
summarized in one iconic gesture unlike

187
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,270
its predecessors he didn't want to live

188
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,220
in the Los Pinos palace oh you might say

189
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,420
well that's great he's a man of the

190
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,340
people but the question is why do you

191
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,930
think he went instead do you remain at

192
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,850
home no of course not he went to the

193
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,980
National Palace in other words he just

194
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,810
switched one palace for the other and

195
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,130
what you think he did with the Las Pinas

196
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,990
palace the palace has now become a

197
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,090
cultural center the first big event was

198
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,130
a public screening of Romo the movie

199
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,290
directed by Alfonso Cuaron in order to

200
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,210
promote Mexican movies and in this

201
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,160
regard we must admit he was pretty

202
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,119
transparent

203
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,499
the Ministry of Culture will have to

204
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:34,659
report how much they spend in popcorn

205
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,029
and punch during the projection of Roma

206
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,580
in Los Pinos okay okay the let's be

207
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,740
clear projecting Roma in the las piñas

208
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,830
palace is not a bad thing but it's not a

209
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,139
good thing either but what actually has

210
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,580
negative consequences for the economy

211
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,159
and does scare investors away are

212
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,569
decisions like canceling the

213
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,729
construction of the airport and changing

214
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,439
all the deals the previous government

215
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,479
had signed with private contractors and

216
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,030
this explains news like this

217
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,470
Mexico Falls eight positions in the

218
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,270
foreign direct investment ranking also

219
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,910
Mexico fell to the last position in the

220
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,890
ranking prepared by a teacher named and

221
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,720
the same goes for energy reform you see

222
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,610
after decades of having a state monopoly

223
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,980
the Mexican oil company Pemex couldn't

224
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,230
be more corrupt they had an enormous

225
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,270
amount of debt and if it wasn't for the

226
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,830
government sport they would have gone

227
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,780
bankrupt years ago the previous

228
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,640
president yet so opens the market for

229
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
foreign investments he started by

230
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,150
auctioning the smallest oil fields off

231
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,800
to anybody who wanted to exploit them

232
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,480
the goal was to increase production and

233
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,400
generate more money the first thing

234
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,900
Ambler did as soon as he got into office

235
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,000
was freeze all those public auctions he

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,950
wants Mexico's oil industry to remain

237
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,540
the way it was and this is a problem

238
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,550
because the country has a big management

239
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,980
issue in this regard for example even

240
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,140
though Mexico has oil reserves it

241
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,330
imports 70% of its gasoline from the

242
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,790
United States which leads to higher gas

243
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,420
prices

244
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,010
why is it important so much whilst

245
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,500
mainly because Pemex is so mismanaged

246
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,690
that their production Falls every year

247
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,430
so how is Emily trying to solve this

248
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,770
well of course by building a brand new

249
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,290
refinery the problem Pemex has no money

250
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,590
and mexico isn't growing so well why is

251
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,940
he gonna get the money well it's very

252
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,620
good question

253
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:21,450
[Music]

254
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,440
Mexican government and Pemex

255
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,570
announcement of building a new refinery

256
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,420
raises many doubts so far all the

257
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,950
contractors that have been participating

258
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,480
in the bidding claims that the

259
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,160
conditions the government requested were

260
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,410
not realistic they want a refinery too

261
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,090
early for too little money but I guess

262
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,980
we're going to have to wait to 2022 to

263
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,230
see who's right bus we can already judge

264
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,840
the success of the education reform this

265
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,190
is another project started by the

266
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,810
previous president that was stopped by

267
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:52,180
an like in this case Mexico had a unique

268
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,890
educational system in most countries

269
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,780
teachers have to pass an exam in order

270
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,090
to be hired by a public school but not

271
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,130
in Mexico in this case it's the teachers

272
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,810
union that controls the hiring process

273
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,750
and a teaching position can be sold or

274
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,660
even inherited yep yeah that right you

275
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,520
can inherit a teacher's job from your

276
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,530
father and you don't even need to prove

277
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,420
that you know the subjects that you're

278
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,070
going to teach this is why Mexico

279
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,050
changed the system and introduced a

280
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:21,410
national exam

281
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,299
it would be changed to a system similar

282
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,489
to Spain's but in Mexico the change

283
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,679
sparked extremely violent protests

284
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,329
especially in the south of the country

285
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,099
thousands of teachers retired before

286
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,049
having to pass the exam and more than a

287
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,639
thousand teachers were fired because

288
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,869
after three attempts they could have

289
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,609
passed most of them of course got

290
00:10:37,609 --> 00:10:39,319
another job at the administration but

291
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,269
don't worry this is all history one of

292
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,099
the most vocal and low supporters during

293
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:45,049
the campaign were those teachers unions

294
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,449
so while now he's returning the favor by

295
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:49,759
going backwards on all those reforms so

296
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,649
a Mexican teachers will once again enjoy

297
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,659
their privileges and Mexican kids will

298
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:56,059
keep failing all their exams but by far

299
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,949
the most controversial thing amlet has

300
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,500
done involves his war against the narcos

301
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,030
[Music]

302
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,920
when Mexico was ruled by the right-wing

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,540
it passed the law to allow the military

304
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,610
to fight the narcos this definitely

305
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,710
didn't work in the last 12 years Mexico

306
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,220
has had more than 250,000 deaths linked

307
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,590
directly to the war on drugs and Lopez

308
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,270
promised that he would stop the war so

309
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,280
what did he do well instead of using the

310
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,990
military he's created a brand new body

311
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,000
called the National Guard dance who's a

312
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,890
part of this National Guard well of

313
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,270
course that would be former soldiers

314
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,040
even the leader is a former military

315
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,230
officer so basically AMLO changed

316
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,060
everything to keep everything the same

317
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,340
and the same is happening with lots of

318
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,440
social programs and even the Mexico City

319
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,060
Airport we talked about that before and

320
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,350
you might think that he did it to save

321
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,930
money but not really that money is being

322
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,030
reinvested in another project with a

323
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,220
more dubious utility and that's the

324
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,200
Mayan train this train will cross the

325
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,820
southern Mexico States which would be

326
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,200
great if those regions were more

327
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,060
developed so with no people or goods to

328
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,500
transport it's wishful thinking to

329
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,910
believe that this is going to push

330
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,130
developments in the region but well this

331
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,850
still isn't the worst thing

332
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,640
my end organizations ask AMLO to stop

333
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
the construction of the Mayan train so

334
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,960
far the project hasn't passed any of the

335
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,120
environmental impact studies but still a

336
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,760
Malays administration keeps on trying in

337
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,080
this political climate where the

338
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,490
president isn't listening to anybody

339
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,500
it's easy to understand why foreign

340
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,390
investors are leaving the country by the

341
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,640
Dozen and this has already had an impact

342
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,370
on the country's economic growth so now

343
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,710
we must ask you do you think Hamlet will

344
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,870
manage to avoid a recession in Mexico or

345
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,070
do you think that the money that's

346
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,020
running away from the country will never

347
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,800
come back

348
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,030
well please leave your answer in the
