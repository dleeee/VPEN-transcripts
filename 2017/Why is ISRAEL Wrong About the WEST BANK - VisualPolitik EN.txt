3
00:00:06.77 --> 00:00:10.260
the conflicts between Israel and

4
00:00:08.76 --> 00:00:12.360
Palestine is one of the most complicated

5
00:00:10.26 --> 00:00:13.320
in international politics and as you

6
00:00:12.36 --> 00:00:15.210
will probably know it's one of the most

7
00:00:13.32 --> 00:00:17.220
controversial political situations in

8
00:00:15.21 --> 00:00:18.750
the entire world well in order to make

9
00:00:17.22 --> 00:00:20.760
it easier in this video we're going to

10
00:00:18.75 --> 00:00:22.680
tackle the very delicate issue of the

11
00:00:20.76 --> 00:00:24.150
Israeli settlements in the West Bank and

12
00:00:22.68 --> 00:00:25.800
this is a pretty major issue because

13
00:00:24.15 --> 00:00:27.990
almost all countries find these

14
00:00:25.8 --> 00:00:30.000
settlements to be a serious violation of

15
00:00:27.99 --> 00:00:31.650
international law in the last 40 years

16
00:00:30.0 --> 00:00:33.059
all of the administration's in the

17
00:00:31.65 --> 00:00:35.160
United States have taken a position

18
00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.500
against them and when I say them I do

19
00:00:35.16 --> 00:00:39.180
mean all of them and yes this matter has

20
00:00:37.5 --> 00:00:41.040
compromised the special relationship

21
00:00:39.18 --> 00:00:42.629
that exists between the US and Israel

22
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:44.640
and I'm not talking about governments

23
00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.559
like Jimmy Carter's here not at all

24
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:48.180
indeed Ronald Reagan himself demanded

25
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.800
the immediate freeze of any new

26
00:00:48.18 --> 00:00:52.050
settlements as he claims they were an

27
00:00:49.8 --> 00:00:53.940
evident obstacle to peace George HW Bush

28
00:00:52.05 --> 00:00:55.620
threatened to take disciplinary measures

29
00:00:53.94 --> 00:00:57.660
of an economic nature and then Bill

30
00:00:55.62 --> 00:00:59.910
Clinton proposed a law to punish Israel

31
00:00:57.66 --> 00:01:01.949
by reducing American assistance even

32
00:00:59.91 --> 00:01:03.780
today at trumps administration has asked

33
00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.119
Israel to stop being such a pain in the

34
00:01:03.78 --> 00:01:07.920
ass about it since taking office in

35
00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.750
January Trump has publicly asked

36
00:01:07.92 --> 00:01:11.520
Netanyahu to constrain sodomy

37
00:01:09.75 --> 00:01:13.080
construction but has not condemned it

38
00:01:11.52 --> 00:01:15.360
the State Department has said that it is

39
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:17.100
not helpful to the peace process so what

40
00:01:15.36 --> 00:01:18.780
do you think Israel has done in the face

41
00:01:17.1 --> 00:01:20.430
of all this criticism well they have

42
00:01:18.78 --> 00:01:23.130
basically ignored it and have kept

43
00:01:20.43 --> 00:01:24.900
expanding their settlements but okay now

44
00:01:23.13 --> 00:01:26.909
we are here you might be wondering what

45
00:01:24.9 --> 00:01:28.590
are these settlements and what do they

46
00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.650
really mean well let's have a look at

47
00:01:28.59 --> 00:01:32.750
that

48
00:01:29.65 --> 00:01:37.320
[Music]

49
00:01:32.75 --> 00:01:38.550
settlers and settlements the first thing

50
00:01:37.32 --> 00:01:40.260
we need to know is that according to

51
00:01:38.55 --> 00:01:42.390
agreements that have been reached the

52
00:01:40.26 --> 00:01:44.160
territory your state of Palestine is

53
00:01:42.39 --> 00:01:46.080
formed by what is today known as the

54
00:01:44.16 --> 00:01:48.030
West Bank and the Gaza Strip these

55
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:50.250
territories corresponds to the political

56
00:01:48.03 --> 00:01:52.470
map prior to the six-day war after which

57
00:01:50.25 --> 00:01:53.850
Israel occupied these territories which

58
00:01:52.47 --> 00:01:55.800
used to belong to Jordan

59
00:01:53.85 --> 00:01:57.690
so the settlements they are essentially

60
00:01:55.8 --> 00:02:00.600
communities villages towns and cities

61
00:01:57.69 --> 00:02:02.700
that Israel has been building since 1970

62
00:02:00.6 --> 00:02:04.890
in the West Bank territory of the future

63
00:02:02.7 --> 00:02:06.479
Palestinian state and it is not just a

64
00:02:04.89 --> 00:02:08.479
few houses we're talking about here the

65
00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.679
West Bank is a small territory at barely

66
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.240
5,600 square kilometers which is about

67
00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.459
the size of the state of Delaware but

68
00:02:12.24 --> 00:02:17.700
even so and this is not considering East

69
00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.470
Jerusalem there are 131 settlements and

70
00:02:17.7 --> 00:02:21.510
furthermore there are an additional and

71
00:02:19.47 --> 00:02:23.250
ninety seven outposts these outposts

72
00:02:21.51 --> 00:02:24.990
they are settlements as well but in

73
00:02:23.25 --> 00:02:27.209
these cases these settlements are

74
00:02:24.99 --> 00:02:28.680
illegal even under Israeli law these

75
00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.630
outposts they were built without the

76
00:02:28.68 --> 00:02:33.240
consents of the Israeli government that

77
00:02:30.63 --> 00:02:34.950
means that there are more than 228

78
00:02:33.24 --> 00:02:37.200
Israeli settlements around the West Bank

79
00:02:34.95 --> 00:02:39.180
many are in places of relevant value

80
00:02:37.2 --> 00:02:40.709
like aquifers and that makes it more

81
00:02:39.18 --> 00:02:42.390
complicated because roads and

82
00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.250
infrastructure need to be set up in

83
00:02:42.39 --> 00:02:45.930
order to connect them besides Israel

84
00:02:44.25 --> 00:02:47.550
needs to protect these settlements and

85
00:02:45.93 --> 00:02:49.470
that involves police patrolling around

86
00:02:47.55 --> 00:02:51.120
the West Bank which effects the mobility

87
00:02:49.47 --> 00:02:54.920
of Palestinians and makes economic

88
00:02:51.12 --> 00:02:54.920
development even more difficult

89
00:02:55.46 --> 00:03:00.150
and the problem isn't just the existence

90
00:02:58.29 --> 00:03:02.220
of the settlements it's that they don't

91
00:03:00.15 --> 00:03:04.350
stop growing in the last year more than

92
00:03:02.22 --> 00:03:06.030
2000 new buildings have started to be

93
00:03:04.35 --> 00:03:08.190
constructed and there are plans to build

94
00:03:06.03 --> 00:03:09.990
3000 more in the next year alone

95
00:03:08.19 --> 00:03:12.000
obviously in addition to this there are

96
00:03:09.99 --> 00:03:14.340
also medical centers schools synagogues

97
00:03:12.0 --> 00:03:16.860
etc so what's the result of all of this

98
00:03:14.34 --> 00:03:24.060
well take a look at this chart to see

99
00:03:16.86 --> 00:03:25.920
how the population has evolved so now

100
00:03:24.06 --> 00:03:27.300
you might be asking well what's the

101
00:03:25.92 --> 00:03:28.830
problem here those who are Pro

102
00:03:27.3 --> 00:03:30.570
settlements claim these population

103
00:03:28.83 --> 00:03:32.310
centers are growing where they used to

104
00:03:30.57 --> 00:03:34.320
be nothing consider what the mayor of

105
00:03:32.31 --> 00:03:36.330
male Adam says about one of the main

106
00:03:34.32 --> 00:03:38.250
settlements we didn't steal the land

107
00:03:36.33 --> 00:03:40.650
from anybody it was built on empty hills

108
00:03:38.25 --> 00:03:42.660
you can see there the desert rocks and

109
00:03:40.65 --> 00:03:46.140
sand now you have a living City been a

110
00:03:42.66 --> 00:03:47.460
cash real mayor of male adumim male Adam

111
00:03:46.14 --> 00:03:49.440
is the city of forty thousand

112
00:03:47.46 --> 00:03:51.420
inhabitants with schools kindergartens a

113
00:03:49.44 --> 00:03:53.250
theater a library an industrial center

114
00:03:51.42 --> 00:03:55.260
according to the residents there it's a

115
00:03:53.25 --> 00:03:56.730
complete City all right again so what

116
00:03:55.26 --> 00:03:57.900
exactly is the problem the problem is

117
00:03:56.73 --> 00:04:00.150
that in order to solve the

118
00:03:57.9 --> 00:04:02.490
israel-palestine conflict all parties

119
00:04:00.15 --> 00:04:04.620
agree the two states are necessary

120
00:04:02.49 --> 00:04:06.480
one being Israel and to being Palestine

121
00:04:04.62 --> 00:04:08.220
but with all the settlements Palestinian

122
00:04:06.48 --> 00:04:09.990
sovereignty in the West Bank will be in

123
00:04:08.22 --> 00:04:11.370
serious danger because Israel has

124
00:04:09.99 --> 00:04:13.290
already said they will never give up

125
00:04:11.37 --> 00:04:15.030
sovereignty over these places and that

126
00:04:13.29 --> 00:04:17.100
includes the roads the infrastructure

127
00:04:15.03 --> 00:04:19.230
the security controls let's be clear

128
00:04:17.1 --> 00:04:21.330
Palestine will be unable to become an

129
00:04:19.23 --> 00:04:23.340
effective and autonomous state with such

130
00:04:21.33 --> 00:04:24.660
limitations especially considering these

131
00:04:23.34 --> 00:04:26.400
settlements won't stop growing

132
00:04:24.66 --> 00:04:28.410
settlements are illegal under

133
00:04:26.4 --> 00:04:30.360
international law and present one of the

134
00:04:28.41 --> 00:04:32.880
main impediments to peace Nikolay

135
00:04:30.36 --> 00:04:33.270
Mladenov United Nations envoy on Middle

136
00:04:32.88 --> 00:04:35.010
East peace

137
00:04:33.27 --> 00:04:38.720
so now you can probably understand why

138
00:04:35.01 --> 00:04:38.720
this topic makes everyone so tense

139
00:04:40.18 --> 00:04:47.120
more and more attention attention over

140
00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.490
Netanyahu's settlement policy hasn't

141
00:04:47.12 --> 00:04:51.110
stopped growing since 2015 the situation

142
00:04:49.49 --> 00:04:53.900
has reached a point that on the 23rd of

143
00:04:51.11 --> 00:04:56.599
December 2016 the UN Security Council

144
00:04:53.9 --> 00:04:58.419
passed resolution 23 34 that strongly

145
00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.280
condemns the Israeli settlement policy

146
00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.289
the Security Council reaffirms that the

147
00:05:01.28 --> 00:05:04.940
establishment by Israel of settlements

148
00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.500
in the Palestinian territory occupied

149
00:05:04.94 --> 00:05:08.419
since 1967

150
00:05:06.5 --> 00:05:10.099
including East Jerusalem has no legal

151
00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.229
validity and constitutes a flagrant

152
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.030
violation under international law and a

153
00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.340
major obstacle to the achievement of a

154
00:05:14.03 --> 00:05:18.470
two-state solution and adjust lasting

155
00:05:16.34 --> 00:05:20.630
and comprehensive peace resolution to

156
00:05:18.47 --> 00:05:22.430
334 of the Security Council this

157
00:05:20.63 --> 00:05:24.139
resolution could be passed because for

158
00:05:22.43 --> 00:05:26.060
the first time the US didn't use their

159
00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.380
right to veto the resolution as well

160
00:05:26.06 --> 00:05:29.300
this is something that made Netanyahu's

161
00:05:27.38 --> 00:05:31.159
government's really furious the Prime

162
00:05:29.3 --> 00:05:33.080
Minister didn't hesitate in describing

163
00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.000
the situation as absurd even accused

164
00:05:33.08 --> 00:05:37.219
Barack Obama's administration in public

165
00:05:35.0 --> 00:05:39.800
of tried to carry out a shameful anti

166
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:42.050
Israeli maneuver so yeah he was pretty

167
00:05:39.8 --> 00:05:44.060
angry but this resolution shouldn't have

168
00:05:42.05 --> 00:05:46.280
taken Netanyahu by surprise given some

169
00:05:44.06 --> 00:05:50.440
of the decisions he announced in 2016

170
00:05:46.28 --> 00:05:50.440
and confirmed in 2017

171
00:05:51.31 --> 00:05:55.120
the Israeli government has started a new

172
00:05:53.47 --> 00:05:57.250
settlement in the West Bank which is the

173
00:05:55.12 --> 00:05:59.740
first for two decades so Israel not only

174
00:05:57.25 --> 00:06:01.540
has decided to encourage the existing

175
00:05:59.74 --> 00:06:03.130
settlements but they've even started a

176
00:06:01.54 --> 00:06:05.320
new one on the other hands maybe

177
00:06:03.13 --> 00:06:07.150
empowered by the alleged good relations

178
00:06:05.32 --> 00:06:09.250
with Trump the Parliament in Israel

179
00:06:07.15 --> 00:06:11.620
after lots of controversy finally passed

180
00:06:09.25 --> 00:06:14.139
a new law in the beginning of 2017

181
00:06:11.62 --> 00:06:16.330
this law legalizes around 4,000 houses

182
00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.610
built on Palestinian private property

183
00:06:16.33 --> 00:06:21.760
houses that the Israeli Supreme Court

184
00:06:18.61 --> 00:06:22.930
had even ordered to be dismantled the

185
00:06:21.76 --> 00:06:24.460
rules of the game have changed with

186
00:06:22.93 --> 00:06:26.110
donald trump's arrivals president we no

187
00:06:24.46 --> 00:06:27.190
longer have our hands tied as we did in

188
00:06:26.11 --> 00:06:29.470
the time of Barack Obama

189
00:06:27.19 --> 00:06:30.760
now we could finally build ante as we

190
00:06:29.47 --> 00:06:32.680
said before the fact that Trump might

191
00:06:30.76 --> 00:06:34.930
look closer to Israel doesn't mean that

192
00:06:32.68 --> 00:06:36.760
his administration isn't also tired of

193
00:06:34.93 --> 00:06:38.770
this settlement issue that is why I'm in

194
00:06:36.76 --> 00:06:40.780
order to regain Trump's favor Jerusalem

195
00:06:38.77 --> 00:06:42.520
is committed to starting a new policy

196
00:06:40.78 --> 00:06:45.190
that seems to slow down the growth of

197
00:06:42.52 --> 00:06:46.870
existing settlements and forbid outposts

198
00:06:45.19 --> 00:06:48.820
completely but the new policy it's so

199
00:06:46.87 --> 00:06:50.500
cryptic and complicated that it seems

200
00:06:48.82 --> 00:06:51.820
very likely these settlements they'll

201
00:06:50.5 --> 00:06:53.290
just keep growing and now you probably

202
00:06:51.82 --> 00:06:55.030
have another question which is why do

203
00:06:53.29 --> 00:06:59.040
these settlements why they grow so much

204
00:06:55.03 --> 00:06:59.040
well pay close attention here

205
00:06:59.87 --> 00:07:07.289
the inexplicable policy thing why do so

206
00:07:06.06 --> 00:07:09.300
many Israelis want to live in these

207
00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.860
conflict zones is it because maybe there

208
00:07:09.3 --> 00:07:13.349
are some valuable natural resources to

209
00:07:10.86 --> 00:07:15.870
be exploited well not really the

210
00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.819
explanation it's much less creative the

211
00:07:15.87 --> 00:07:19.380
government of Israel is subsidizing the

212
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.840
establishment of these settlements

213
00:07:19.38 --> 00:07:23.639
that's right the government in Israel Co

214
00:07:21.84 --> 00:07:25.919
finances the construction of houses

215
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.080
creating discounts of almost 70 percent

216
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.270
for the price of land and offers a great

217
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:32.159
deal of financial aid and you know the

218
00:07:30.27 --> 00:07:34.560
result is well houses are 40 percent

219
00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:36.389
cheaper than in the formal territory of

220
00:07:34.56 --> 00:07:37.770
Israel and well that's not all the

221
00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.960
government of Israel also ensures

222
00:07:37.77 --> 00:07:41.729
security and provides all kinds of

223
00:07:39.96 --> 00:07:43.860
public services so as you can imagine

224
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:45.389
the youth then as many families see

225
00:07:43.86 --> 00:07:47.430
these as places where they can have a

226
00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:49.500
better life than they could in Israel's

227
00:07:47.43 --> 00:07:51.120
formal territory so now the question

228
00:07:49.5 --> 00:07:53.220
becomes well how does Israel itself

229
00:07:51.12 --> 00:07:55.380
benefit from this well the truth is they

230
00:07:53.22 --> 00:07:57.150
really don't send an exchange they get

231
00:07:55.38 --> 00:07:59.009
just a bunch of political and economic

232
00:07:57.15 --> 00:08:00.720
problems these settlements aren't just

233
00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.970
an obstacle for the peace process and

234
00:08:00.72 --> 00:08:04.500
foreign policy they are also a big waste

235
00:08:02.97 --> 00:08:06.240
of public money so look with the

236
00:08:04.5 --> 00:08:08.280
subsidies the security the expense of

237
00:08:06.24 --> 00:08:09.900
public services peace now Foundation and

238
00:08:08.28 --> 00:08:11.669
the adverse center both Israeli by the

239
00:08:09.9 --> 00:08:13.650
way estimate that the cost of these is

240
00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:15.330
more than a billion dollars a year in

241
00:08:13.65 --> 00:08:17.490
other words this is nothing there's an

242
00:08:15.33 --> 00:08:21.120
expensive policy both for the citizens

243
00:08:17.49 --> 00:08:24.240
of Palestine as well as those of Israel

244
00:08:21.12 --> 00:08:24.240
[Music]

245
00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:29.169
don't get fooled

246
00:08:29.63 --> 00:08:34.430
but let me be absolutely clear Israel is

247
00:08:32.18 --> 00:08:36.080
a country full of positive things unlike

248
00:08:34.43 --> 00:08:38.539
that neighboring countries Israel is a

249
00:08:36.08 --> 00:08:40.130
consolidated democracy with strong civil

250
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:42.080
liberties and a prosperous and

251
00:08:40.13 --> 00:08:43.580
innovative economy many of the products

252
00:08:42.08 --> 00:08:45.260
and services we use every day wouldn't

253
00:08:43.58 --> 00:08:46.970
exist if it weren't for the technology

254
00:08:45.26 --> 00:08:48.500
developed in Israel and don't be fools

255
00:08:46.97 --> 00:08:50.240
putting an end to these settlements

256
00:08:48.5 --> 00:08:52.700
wouldn't mean an end to the conflicts

257
00:08:50.24 --> 00:08:54.650
because there is a precedent in 2005

258
00:08:52.7 --> 00:08:56.240
Israel left the Gaza Strip completely

259
00:08:54.65 --> 00:08:58.370
stopping all the settlements and

260
00:08:56.24 --> 00:08:59.860
removing all civilians and soldiers and

261
00:08:58.37 --> 00:09:02.030
the result was neither peace nor

262
00:08:59.86 --> 00:09:04.040
prosperity the strip is now controlled

263
00:09:02.03 --> 00:09:05.720
by Hamas radicals and it is even in

264
00:09:04.04 --> 00:09:07.940
conflict with the government Palestine

265
00:09:05.72 --> 00:09:09.500
itself and the situation isn't good from

266
00:09:07.94 --> 00:09:10.940
a humanitarian perspective but it

267
00:09:09.5 --> 00:09:12.980
definitely doesn't justify the

268
00:09:10.94 --> 00:09:14.450
settlement policy of Israel and their

269
00:09:12.98 --> 00:09:16.460
lack of commitment towards the peace

270
00:09:14.45 --> 00:09:18.470
agreements and so now the question is is

271
00:09:16.46 --> 00:09:20.420
there really any possible solution to

272
00:09:18.47 --> 00:09:21.950
this conflict well more and more experts

273
00:09:20.42 --> 00:09:24.230
claim the solution needs to be a

274
00:09:21.95 --> 00:09:26.000
bottom-up strategy that is to say

275
00:09:24.23 --> 00:09:27.830
encourage economic development in the

276
00:09:26.0 --> 00:09:29.390
West Bank establish a dialogue and

277
00:09:27.83 --> 00:09:31.190
understanding where trade relations

278
00:09:29.39 --> 00:09:32.780
between Israelis and Palestinians and

279
00:09:31.19 --> 00:09:34.790
normal and let's the national

280
00:09:32.78 --> 00:09:37.040
authorities in Palestine have more

281
00:09:34.79 --> 00:09:39.260
jurisdiction these they will require

282
00:09:37.04 --> 00:09:41.450
time but more than that they require

283
00:09:39.26 --> 00:09:42.680
commitments as it now is your turn what

284
00:09:41.45 --> 00:09:44.270
do you think should happen with the

285
00:09:42.68 --> 00:09:45.890
settlements well please do leave your
