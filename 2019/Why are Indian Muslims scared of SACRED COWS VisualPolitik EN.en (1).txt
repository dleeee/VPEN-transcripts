00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,110
elections again if you think ultra

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,019

9
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,269

as the entire population of the United

States nevertheless I bet you couldn't

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,379
even name their Prime Minister

22
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,869

23
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,670
second most populated country on the

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,240

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,580

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,420
that looking this peaceful being

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,240
vegetarian and practicing yoga that Modi

34
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,310
would be a spiritual politician who

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,310
loves peace and human rights right well

36
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,020
actually no the opposite is true

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,300
next in render Modi Donald Trump looks

38
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,240

40
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,950
have you ever heard about India's sacred

41
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,650
cows well yes they are real and believe

42
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,930
me when I say that this is much more

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,240
than just a funny thing from Hinduism

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,610
the cow bells is a group of Indian

45
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,770
states where religion plays a major role

46
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,870
in society within these regions we have

47
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,600
the calve Atlantis theoretically the cow

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,700
vigilantes role is to protect these

49
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,860
animals but in many cases they formed

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,720
into violent tribes that attack

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,510
minorities mainly Muslims according to a

52
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,010
Human Rights Watch report in the last

53
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,530
five years they have killed more than 44

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,570
people just because they were eating

55
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,580
beef in other words you can find

56
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,040
fanatics in any religion including

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,970
Hinduism

58
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,150
[Music]

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,920
but if India is the world's largest

60
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,980
democracy their elections are also the

61
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,900
world's longest in most democratic

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,640
countries voting lasts for one or two

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,240
days in India it takes seven weeks why

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,730
because every state holds elections on

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,200
different days and remember we're

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,110
talking about 900 million possible

67
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,790
voters here along with long elections

68
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,020
the campaign has also been a hell of a

69
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,480
show from the tension with Pakistan to a

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,790
Bollywood movie yes you had that right

71
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,560
if spots weren't enough Narendra Modi

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,620
made his own Bollywood biopic Prime

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,110
Minister Narendra Modi movie review an

74
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,570
unabashed hagiography with such a huge

75
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,430
electoral campaign Modi has been

76
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,110
reelected in a landslide victory

77
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,110
disappears party has 65 percent of the

78
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,760
seats in the parliament this is similar

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,340
to the majority that Putin in Russia has

80
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,440
or Orman has in Hungary and the

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,150
opposition parties in India are too

82
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,220
small to effectively block his policies

83
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,800
so today's question is why is India

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
decided to give even more support to the

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,970
far-right can we really say that this

86
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,460
country is radicalizing and what kind of

87
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,380
consequences will this have for the rest

88
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,700
of the world well today we're going to

89
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,230
answer all of these questions but before

90
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,600
we do let's take a look back at the

91
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,660
history

92
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,260
[Music]

93
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,209
bori would mahatma ghandi is more than

94
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,040
the founding father of modern day India

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,379
he is a universal icon his goal was that

96
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,269
once India became independent both

97
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,890
Hindus and Muslims could coexist

98
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,959
peacefully although India is a Hindu

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,269
majority country they also have a Muslim

100
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,189
minority well it's not even fair to say

101
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,540
that it's a minority really because

102
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,519
we're talking about more than 200

103
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,709
million people who believe in Muhammad's

104
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,930
teachings that said both Gandhi and Modi

105
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,730
were born in the same state and this is

106
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,920
where the similarities between these two

107
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,049
and Modi was born into a humble family

108
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,759
and since he was a child he was

109
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,570
fascinated by politics so where did he

110
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,310
go he went to the association of

111
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,530
national volunteers also known as the

112
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,449
Shang family this is a radical Hindu

113
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:33,729
organization with a clear target in mind

114
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:39,910
Muslims are the enemy to give you a

115
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,680
better understanding the man who shot

116
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,389
Gandhi was affiliated with this

117
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,370
organization and yes he killed Gandhi

118
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,840
because Gandhi had the goal of making

119
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,660
Hindus and Muslims coexist peacefully so

120
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,280
the sharing family formed the basis of

121
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,139
Narendra Modi's political party to

122
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,570
Bharatiya Janata Party also known as the

123
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,789
BJP as you can imagine the ideology of

124
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,530
this party is not exactly centrist

125
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,180
nevertheless soon became one of the

126
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,099
biggest political groups in all of India

127
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,840
here is where Modi kick-started his

128
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,909
political career in 2001 he became the

129
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,770
chief minister of the state of Gujarat

130
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,810
and this is how his legend started

131
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,449
basically Modi combines the BJP is

132
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,460
radical narrative with a taste for

133
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,740
pragmatic economics on the radical side

134
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,360
he even lost the visa to travel to

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,669
America of the European Union the reason

136
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:23,620
was that he allowed Hindu radicals to

137
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,130
basically oppress Muslims

138
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,860
[Music]

139
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,620
in 2002 Hindu radicals killed more than

140
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,780
a thousand Muslims Modi's administration

141
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,820
was accused of handing the radicals list

142
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,310
all the properties owned by Muslims on

143
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,380
the other hand Modi had his bright side

144
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,510
in economics he privatized several state

145
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,820
owned enterprises he created industrial

146
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,860
parks and removed a lot of red tape

147
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,810
which is a persistent problem across all

148
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,060
of India in very few years Gujarat was

149
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,340
growing at a 10 percent rate year after

150
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,920
year everybody saw Modi as a model for

151
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
the rest of the country so what was the

152
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,370
next step then well of course that would

153
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,640
be ruling the entire country in 2014

154
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,060
Modi became India's Prime Minister

155
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,130
[Music]

156
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,260
his program included ending a lot of

157
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,510
bureaucracy modernizing country and

158
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,730
improving the country's relationship

159
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,620
with America don't forget that India

160
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,420
used to be blacklisted by the White

161
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,220
House because of their nuclear program

162
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,930
so Modi actually did a great job of

163
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,490
getting close to Washington yeah you

164
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,170
heard that right he went from not having

165
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,270
a visa to entering the states and

166
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,550
becoming Obama's personal friends don't

167
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,730
believe me well just check this out

168
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,860
Obama writes profile for Modi in times

169
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,740
most influential list yes you heard that

170
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,570
right Barack Obama himself became

171
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,280
besties with Modi despite them having

172
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,610
opposing ideologies he might wonder

173
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,810
house is even possible basically

174
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,460
everybody was expecting India's economy

175
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,250
to boom just like China's hat and Modi

176
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,320
seemed like the man for the drop Ri Ri

177
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,000
so he might not be the biggest human

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,260
rights fan but this is international

179
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,630
politics and we've seen worse but now

180
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,700
the question is did Modi really pull

181
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,920
India out of poverty what has he done

182
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,690
during his time in office let's have a

183
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,940
look shall we

Gandhi's assassin was a patriot you

188
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,340
might think that this isn't the best

189
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,930
thing to say during an electoral

190
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,240
campaign in India but this is what

191
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,520
Prager Thakur said before the elections

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,830
progress occur is a politician from the

193
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,130
BJP and yes she has won the elections in

194
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,110
her districts just like Modi did and if

195
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,970
this isn't brutal enough for you just

196
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,740
look at this quote from a Machado

197
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,040
chairman of the party lammott Shah vows

198
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,200
to throw illegal immigrants into the Bay

199
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,270
of Bengal I did tell you at the end of

200
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,860
this video you'll think that Donald

201
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,050
Trump was a Hollywood liberal and just

202
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,910
wait because you haven't seen anything

203
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,740
yet now you might be wondering how is it

204
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,630
possible that with such a radical agenda

205
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,000
Modi and his party had a landslide

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,490
victory well the answer lies in one word

207
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,460
economics in this regard Modi reminds us

208
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,010
of Aragon the Turkish president both are

209
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,690
religious extremists both had good

210
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,460
relationships with Americans both

211
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,130
bragged about economics some points wait

212
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,120
a minute did you say that you don't know

213
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,470
anything about Erdogan good news we

214
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,210
talked about him in another video I'm

215
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,650
going to link to that and don't forget

216
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,240
that if you want to discover what

217
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,470
happens around the world you should

218
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,660
absolutely subscribe to visual politic

219
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,860

221
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160

several times a week so don't miss those

226
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,820
hit that Bell but let's get back to our

227
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,160
story under Modi's government the Indian

228
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,040
economy kept growing at a 7% rate his

229
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,780
administration managed to balance the

230
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,730
accounts by creating new taxes like v8e

231
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,430
and this man has crafted himself an

232
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,560
image of a humble hard-working and

233
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,630
business friendly politician but as we

234
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,540
said before the radical influences then

235
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,360
present during his entire administration

236
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,529
basically he's given the sharing family

237
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,120
the keys to the government today the

238
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,800
group controls the police they are me

239
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,630
and the courts that's not all they

240
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,310
control the biggest private school in

241
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,810
the country this means that five million

242
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,190
children are educated every day

243
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,350
alongside their extremist principals and

244
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,120
if the Shang family isn't radical enough

245
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,889
for you there are other organizations

246
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:27,580
that make headlines like this one

247
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,590
mahjong doll activists beat up Muslim

248
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,720
boy for going shopping with Hindu girl

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,400
as you can see the advance of Hindu

250
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,080
radicalism is becoming more and more

251
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,940
worrying and I say Hindu radicalism

252
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,460
because Modi's core ideology goes way

253
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,710
beyond simple nationalism for example

254
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,360
his government has offered Indian

255
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,400
nationality to a lot of immigrants from

256
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,070
Bangladesh Afghanistan or even Pakistan

257
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,590
they just have to meet one condition

258
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,590
not being Muslim so yes Vijay peas

259
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,540
radicalism is a religious one they want

260
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,820
India to just have Hinduism Buddhism or

261
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,400
other small local religions and you

262
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,770
might wonder so well what's wrong with

263
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,260
that it's their country and those aren't

264
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,300
their religions right well in that case

265
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,280
do you remember that India still has

266
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,890
more than 200 million Muslims they

267
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,590
represent 14% of the entire population

268
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,990
and believe me their lives are not easy

269
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,730
why well let's get back to those sacred

270
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,700
cows shall we

271
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,960
before Modi became Prime Minister cows

272
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,610
were sacred until the moments they

273
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,900
weren't productive anymore then

274
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,580
authorities let them get slaughtered so

275
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,410
their meat could be eaten usually those

276
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,900
slaughterhouses were owned by Muslims

277
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,970
and Muslims were the ones who ate the

278
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,580
beef - under the BJP rule many states

279
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,560
have banned beef consumption and the

280
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,540
government has spent almost ninety

281
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,640
million dollars building cow shelters

282
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,680
known as cash Arliss inside of these

283
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,960
shelters cows are protected under Hindu

284
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,000
religious principles and they promote

285
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
vegetarianism of course all these

286
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,810
measures are a direct attack on the

287
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,760
Muslim community many Muslim families

288
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,770
lived off the production of cow meat and

289
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,170
now they've lost their livelihoods but

290
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,420
most of the radical groups this is just

291
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,870
not enough

292
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,820
so in today's India it's easy to find

293
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,070
news like this

294
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,750
Kal Virgil ante is in India killed at

295
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,140
least 44 people report finds about 280

296
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,430
people injured in more than a hundred

297
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,070
tacks over three years as all of you

298
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,320
before you can find fanatics in any

299
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,700
religion all right so you might be

300
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,290
wondering now what about the economics

301
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,870
can we really say Modi was successful in

302
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,330
this regard the truth is also pretty

303
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,890
disappointing so let's have a look

304
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,460
[Music]

305
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,460
smoke streams January the 30th is the

306
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,020
school day of non-violence and peace and

307
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,700
observance of the day Gandhi was

308
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,620
assassinated at this moment in the video

309
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,240
you already know that Gandhi and Modi

310
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,040
couldn't be more different if Gandhi was

311
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,100
a Peace icon Modi is a social pyromaniac

312
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,930
while it's true that India is still

313
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,500
growing

314
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,180
we shouldn't give credit to Modi for

315
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,100
this in fact India started growing

316
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,080
decades ago and its population is

317
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,680
growing too

318
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,970
[Music]

319
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,489
what isn't growing is the job market

320
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,559
specifically employment for youths young

321
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,689
unemployment is at a record high and

322
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,309
Modi's promised to create 10 million

323
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,429
jobs is still just a promise also

324
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:19,229
farmers are angry Modi increased food

325
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:21,149
imports to make prices cheaper this is

326
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,529
great for the cities but it's not great

327
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:24,299
for the countryside even if this

328
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,549
liberalisation was good in the long term

329
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,829
it made moody lose a lot of votes in

330
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:31,259
rural areas and the same goes for his

331
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,059
fight against the shadow economy this is

332
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,889
perhaps his biggest failure overnight

333
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,720
government retired 80% of Indian

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,849
currency from circulation they wanted to

335
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,979
force everyone to use credit cards and

336
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:43,619
bank transfers instead of cash this way

337
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:48,730
they couldn't evade taxes

338
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,950
the problem not everyone has a bank

339
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,540
account in India and financial

340
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,310
institutions they were not well prepared

341
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,020
for this so all of a sudden you had

342
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,850
hundreds of people go into the bank

343
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,830
officers trying to open an account and

344
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,110
the bankers didn't even know what to do

345
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,210
and who suffered the most well of course

346
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,160
it was the poorest people those who had

347
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,810
small businesses like a hassle on a

348
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,580
street fruit shop or other small

349
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,160
business had lots of trouble making ends

350
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,910
meet

351
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,770
all of this explains why at the

352
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,740
beginning of 2019 polls looked really

353
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,630
bad for Modi of course he would still

354
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,310
win the elections but he would lose the

355
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,960
absolute majority and he would have to

356
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,300
form coalition's with other parties so

357
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,740
what does an extremist politician do

358
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,930
when he wants to rise in the polls well

359
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,790
the same thing and again did the same

360
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:40,030
old protectionism India curbs power of

361
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,100
Amazon and Walmart to sell products

362
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,020
online but as we said before Modi as a

363
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,820
total pyromaniac and team knows how to

364
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,830
create smoke screens this is why in

365
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,840
order to raise national pride tensions

366
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,030
with Pakistan their diehard enemy other

367
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,640
a great thing under Modi India performed

368
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,770
their first airstrike against Pakistan

369
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,720
territory in 40 years

370
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,730
this was their response to the Kashmir

371
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,170
terrorist attack fortunately this

372
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,120
conflict hasn't become a nuclear war but

373
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,700
it has been a great help for Modi in the

374
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,000
elections as we said in 2019 polls said

375
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,860
Modi wouldn't have the absolute majority

376
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,110
now six months after that Modi has had a

377
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,000
huge victory remember the figure that

378
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,460
party has 65 percent of seats in

379
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,970
parliament

380
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,889
and now the question goes to you do you

381
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,720
think Modi is playing with fire using

382
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,239
this ultra-nationalist strategy can Modi

383
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,220
get India out of poverty is Gandhi's

384
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,439
legacy lost in this country well please
