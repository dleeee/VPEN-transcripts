[Music]

3
00:00:07.21 --> 00:00:11.990
did you know there is a country in South

4
00:00:09.74 --> 00:00:14.300
America where most of its population are

5
00:00:11.99 --> 00:00:20.300
of Indian origin and where the official

6
00:00:14.3 --> 00:00:21.860
language is English now if you don't

7
00:00:20.3 --> 00:00:23.989
know which country I'm talking about

8
00:00:21.86 --> 00:00:25.910
don't worry because this is one of the

9
00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.579
least known countries in the region and

10
00:00:25.91 --> 00:00:30.649
to be fair the media doesn't really pay

11
00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.880
that much attention to it so a small

12
00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
those four countries of the media don't

13
00:00:31.88 --> 00:00:35.810
talk about very much well that sounds

14
00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:41.420
like the perfect ingredients very visual

15
00:00:35.81 --> 00:00:43.910
politics video we are talking about

16
00:00:41.42 --> 00:00:46.580
Guyana an old British colony who didn't

17
00:00:43.91 --> 00:00:48.350
get independence until 1966

18
00:00:46.58 --> 00:00:49.970
interestingly at the moment of

19
00:00:48.35 --> 00:00:52.610
independence both the government and

20
00:00:49.97 --> 00:00:55.190
popular opinion was generally in favor

21
00:00:52.61 --> 00:00:57.470
of turning Guyana into a socialist

22
00:00:55.19 --> 00:00:59.690
country it was this mindset which gave

23
00:00:57.47 --> 00:01:02.630
the country its Pinto s official name

24
00:00:59.69 --> 00:01:05.509
the co-operative Republic of Guyana but

25
00:01:02.63 --> 00:01:07.820
let's focus on the country today diana

26
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.700
is one of the poorest countries in South

27
00:01:07.82 --> 00:01:11.320
America

28
00:01:08.7 --> 00:01:13.780
[Music]

29
00:01:11.32 --> 00:01:16.090
it has crime and violence rates that are

30
00:01:13.78 --> 00:01:18.160
some of the highest in the entire region

31
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:20.410
and that's saying a lot

32
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:22.000
in fact if Guyana is known for anything

33
00:01:20.41 --> 00:01:24.790
it would be for its place in the

34
00:01:22.0 --> 00:01:26.170
international supply of cocaine oh and

35
00:01:24.79 --> 00:01:28.330
also for having one of the highest

36
00:01:26.17 --> 00:01:30.850
suicide rates in the world so not

37
00:01:28.33 --> 00:01:32.710
exactly brilliant things now with all of

38
00:01:30.85 --> 00:01:35.200
this information you'd be forgiven for

39
00:01:32.71 --> 00:01:37.990
not being optimistic about the future of

40
00:01:35.2 --> 00:01:44.020
this Caribbean country but they may be

41
00:01:37.99 --> 00:01:47.979
about to get a lot luckier any you own

42
00:01:44.02 --> 00:01:50.710
power these the signs point to Guiana

43
00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.720
becoming an oil power for the time being

44
00:01:50.71 --> 00:01:55.360
this more republic with a population of

45
00:01:52.72 --> 00:01:57.369
about 750,000 inhabitants has already

46
00:01:55.36 --> 00:01:59.740
got the attention and dollars of

47
00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:05.590
multinational companies such as Exxon or

48
00:01:59.74 --> 00:02:08.280
Tesco in size after several years

49
00:02:05.59 --> 00:02:11.230
exploring the area on January the 13th

50
00:02:08.28 --> 00:02:13.300
2017 these two powerful oil companies

51
00:02:11.23 --> 00:02:14.800
announced the discovery of what they

52
00:02:13.3 --> 00:02:17.410
think could be one of the most

53
00:02:14.8 --> 00:02:19.989
significant oil and gas reserves found

54
00:02:17.41 --> 00:02:22.450
less decade oil reserves have been found

55
00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.670
in deep waters in the steam mantle under

56
00:02:22.45 --> 00:02:26.470
the coastal waters of Guiana early

57
00:02:24.67 --> 00:02:28.150
calculations estimate that the amount of

58
00:02:26.47 --> 00:02:31.570
oil which can be exploited in the

59
00:02:28.15 --> 00:02:33.880
country is no less than 4000 million

60
00:02:31.57 --> 00:02:36.760
barrels and many experts affirm this

61
00:02:33.88 --> 00:02:38.560
could be a much larger quantity so it

62
00:02:36.76 --> 00:02:40.900
seems that this country holds a huge

63
00:02:38.56 --> 00:02:43.150
fortune just off its shorts but the

64
00:02:40.9 --> 00:02:46.000
question really is how much is this all

65
00:02:43.15 --> 00:02:47.350
really worth considering the price of

66
00:02:46.0 --> 00:02:50.890
oil nowadays we are talking about

67
00:02:47.35 --> 00:02:52.570
roughly 200 billion dollars so leaving

68
00:02:50.89 --> 00:02:54.489
other natural resources of size and

69
00:02:52.57 --> 00:02:56.620
considering only petrol this would

70
00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.350
result in the equivalence of two hundred

71
00:02:56.62 --> 00:03:00.790
and fifty thousand dollars per citizen

72
00:02:59.35 --> 00:03:02.680
and it's important to note that the oil

73
00:03:00.79 --> 00:03:06.030
reserves could be much bigger than the

74
00:03:02.68 --> 00:03:06.030
early calculation vindicate

75
00:03:06.27 --> 00:03:11.340
now it is true that oil exploitation is

76
00:03:09.09 --> 00:03:13.590
expensive and requires enormous

77
00:03:11.34 --> 00:03:15.930
investment but this could still be the

78
00:03:13.59 --> 00:03:19.170
first step in a new era of prosperity

79
00:03:15.93 --> 00:03:21.360
for Dioner so far the oil companies I've

80
00:03:19.17 --> 00:03:23.970
mentioned ExxonMobil and Hess have

81
00:03:21.36 --> 00:03:26.190
committed to investing 900 million

82
00:03:23.97 --> 00:03:28.530
dollars a year in Guiana over the next

83
00:03:26.19 --> 00:03:30.600
few years the government is investing -

84
00:03:28.53 --> 00:03:31.530
which plans to start exporting oil in

85
00:03:30.6 --> 00:03:33.360
2020

86
00:03:31.53 --> 00:03:36.000
this means Guiana could be on the cusp

87
00:03:33.36 --> 00:03:38.310
of becoming one of the greatest economic

88
00:03:36.0 --> 00:03:40.760
developments that South America has ever

89
00:03:38.31 --> 00:03:44.380
seen

90
00:03:40.76 --> 00:03:44.380
[Music]

91
00:03:46.37 --> 00:03:50.870
yeah Gianna that poor violence country

92
00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.519
could become the kind of country which

93
00:03:50.87 --> 00:03:55.040
other people in South America who are

94
00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.660
unemployed might look at and think I

95
00:03:55.04 --> 00:03:58.670
want to change my life I want

96
00:03:56.66 --> 00:04:01.519
opportunities I want to go to Guiana

97
00:03:58.67 --> 00:04:03.650
Guiana could become that big hope for

98
00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.629
many unemployed South American people

99
00:04:03.65 --> 00:04:08.810
nevertheless before they start hacking

100
00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:11.060
we have to say that it's not going to be

101
00:04:08.81 --> 00:04:17.780
that easy the road ahead is going to be

102
00:04:11.06 --> 00:04:21.200
fought with difficulties conflicts with

103
00:04:17.78 --> 00:04:22.460
Venezuela much of the oil exploration is

104
00:04:21.2 --> 00:04:24.560
happening in areas that have been

105
00:04:22.46 --> 00:04:28.100
claimed by Venezuela and the part they

106
00:04:24.56 --> 00:04:30.410
have claimed is not exactly small Maduro

107
00:04:28.1 --> 00:04:32.419
considers the region known as Guiana at

108
00:04:30.41 --> 00:04:34.910
we burn to be there and this region

109
00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.060
represents more than 70% of Guiana

110
00:04:34.91 --> 00:04:40.190
surface

111
00:04:37.06 --> 00:04:42.650
so essentially Venezuela is claiming of

112
00:04:40.19 --> 00:04:44.660
the entire country as their own and as

113
00:04:42.65 --> 00:04:46.940
if it wasn't bad enough another area

114
00:04:44.66 --> 00:04:49.100
which makes up 7% of its territory is

115
00:04:46.94 --> 00:04:50.930
claimed by their neighbors in Suriname

116
00:04:49.1 --> 00:04:52.669
if their neighbors had the way Guiana

117
00:04:50.93 --> 00:04:55.160
would have been carved up and split

118
00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.200
between them a long time ago the thing

119
00:04:55.16 --> 00:04:58.910
is this conflict over territory seemed

120
00:04:57.2 --> 00:05:00.770
to have been forgotten for years this

121
00:04:58.91 --> 00:05:02.450
was likely a consequence of the good

122
00:05:00.77 --> 00:05:04.490
relations that the government kept with

123
00:05:02.45 --> 00:05:08.590
Cuba a country that holds a lot of

124
00:05:04.49 --> 00:05:08.590
influence over this part of the world

125
00:05:08.88 --> 00:05:13.480
it was also likely because Venezuela

126
00:05:11.35 --> 00:05:15.430
wanted the support of organizations such

127
00:05:13.48 --> 00:05:17.830
as karakov the Caribbean community of

128
00:05:15.43 --> 00:05:20.170
which Guiana is a member so now you

129
00:05:17.83 --> 00:05:21.850
might be wondering is he on a Caribbean

130
00:05:20.17 --> 00:05:24.130
country or is it a South American

131
00:05:21.85 --> 00:05:26.200
country well it's sort of both

132
00:05:24.13 --> 00:05:28.900
geographically speaking so the country

133
00:05:26.2 --> 00:05:30.730
is in South America but politically

134
00:05:28.9 --> 00:05:33.640
culturally and socially speaking

135
00:05:30.73 --> 00:05:35.560
gianna is a Caribbean country in fact

136
00:05:33.64 --> 00:05:37.720
Guiana was one of the countries which

137
00:05:35.56 --> 00:05:39.700
used to benefit from petrol to reap an

138
00:05:37.72 --> 00:05:41.620
initiative by Hugo Chavez that was

139
00:05:39.7 --> 00:05:43.540
supplying cheap high quality oil to

140
00:05:41.62 --> 00:05:46.180
those countries which were themes France

141
00:05:43.54 --> 00:05:48.490
but it all changed when on May the 11th

142
00:05:46.18 --> 00:05:50.410
of 2005 the left-wing government of the

143
00:05:48.49 --> 00:05:52.540
People's Progressive Party lost the

144
00:05:50.41 --> 00:05:54.910
general elections to a coalition headed

145
00:05:52.54 --> 00:05:56.980
by their new president David Granger a

146
00:05:54.91 --> 00:05:59.110
man who was closer to Washington and who

147
00:05:56.98 --> 00:06:04.480
decided to end once and for all the

148
00:05:59.11 --> 00:06:05.980
claims coming from Venezuela it was at

149
00:06:04.48 --> 00:06:08.800
that moment that the long ignored

150
00:06:05.98 --> 00:06:10.900
conflict to defrost it and things really

151
00:06:08.8 --> 00:06:15.190
started to heat up it's still carrying a

152
00:06:10.9 --> 00:06:17.650
monkey on its back that monkey is the

153
00:06:15.19 --> 00:06:19.720
unbearable burden of an oppressive and

154
00:06:17.65 --> 00:06:21.970
obnoxious claim our land and sea space

155
00:06:19.72 --> 00:06:22.840
now the conflict is in the hands of the

156
00:06:21.97 --> 00:06:25.090
United Nations

157
00:06:22.84 --> 00:06:26.950
so whatever the solution might be if

158
00:06:25.09 --> 00:06:28.840
there is any it's important to be aware

159
00:06:26.95 --> 00:06:30.750
of this threat to the potential

160
00:06:28.84 --> 00:06:33.860
prosperous future of the honor

161
00:06:30.75 --> 00:06:37.340
[Music]

162
00:06:33.86 --> 00:06:39.500
Rachelle's conference another important

163
00:06:37.34 --> 00:06:41.960
risk is the recurrent racial conflicts

164
00:06:39.5 --> 00:06:43.819
in Guyana which is a continuous presence

165
00:06:41.96 --> 00:06:46.129
in the country's media Vianna is a

166
00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.960
complex country demographically around

167
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.479
50 percent of its population is of

168
00:06:47.96 --> 00:06:56.780
Indian origin while 40 percent is of

169
00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:58.759
African origin these are two big groups

170
00:06:56.78 --> 00:07:00.919
who are not exactly on the friendliest

171
00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.930
of terms in fact the black minority

172
00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.060
claims that for years the Indian

173
00:07:02.93 --> 00:07:06.770
majority has obtained privileges from

174
00:07:05.06 --> 00:07:08.900
the government and always got their way

175
00:07:06.77 --> 00:07:11.210
this is triggered recurrence waves of

176
00:07:08.9 --> 00:07:12.860
varna luckily the situation seems to

177
00:07:11.21 --> 00:07:14.360
have improved in fact the winning

178
00:07:12.86 --> 00:07:20.090
coalition governments is quite

179
00:07:14.36 --> 00:07:21.740
multiracial however there is still the

180
00:07:20.09 --> 00:07:24.050
possibility that further internal

181
00:07:21.74 --> 00:07:25.580
conflict will flare up in any case not

182
00:07:24.05 --> 00:07:27.379
only does this new government have an

183
00:07:25.58 --> 00:07:28.909
opportunity to overcome decades of

184
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:31.159
conflicts once and for all that it's

185
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.810
also being looked to suffice violence

186
00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.669
and corruption in the country

187
00:07:32.81 --> 00:07:36.800
something that Gianna's certainly need

188
00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:38.440
in one of the most corrupt countries in

189
00:07:36.8 --> 00:07:40.520
the world according to Transparency

190
00:07:38.44 --> 00:07:42.469
International so the new government has

191
00:07:40.52 --> 00:07:44.509
quite a few major tasks ahead of them

192
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:46.580
oil exploitation as well as a fight

193
00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:48.589
against corruption and criminality in

194
00:07:46.58 --> 00:07:50.750
the country nothing is if they achieve

195
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:52.669
their goals Guiana will attract great

196
00:07:50.75 --> 00:07:54.979
attention and may become one of the

197
00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:57.050
richest countries in South America but

198
00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:59.599
this will only be if they use their

199
00:07:57.05 --> 00:08:02.569
resources well the question is will that

200
00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:04.279
happen and it's certainly a big question

201
00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:05.599
so we've given you our opinion here a

202
00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:07.159
visual politics and now we'd love to

203
00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:09.050
know what you think the using gianna

204
00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:10.639
will successfully take advantage of

205
00:08:09.05 --> 00:08:12.500
their newly discovered oil and what

206
00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:14.539
position do you think Venezuela should
