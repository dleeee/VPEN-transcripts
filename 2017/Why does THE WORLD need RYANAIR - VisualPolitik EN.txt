2
00:00:06.71 --> 00:00:10.800
Ryann app is one of the most innovative

3
00:00:09.21 --> 00:00:13.440
companies on the planet and yet it also

4
00:00:10.8 --> 00:00:15.120
manages to be one of the most hated yeah

5
00:00:13.44 --> 00:00:17.039
yeah we've all heard of companies like

6
00:00:15.12 --> 00:00:18.539
Tesla or hyper Li but but let's be

7
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.119
honest it's going to be years before

8
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.010
those companies actually change lives as

9
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.920
if they ever do Ryanair they have

10
00:00:23.01 --> 00:00:27.090
created a revolution already and I'm not

11
00:00:25.92 --> 00:00:29.760
just worried about European

12
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:31.050
Ryanair's sway can be felt worldwide but

13
00:00:29.76 --> 00:00:32.640
on the other side of things it's hard to

14
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:34.440
find someone who doesn't hate this

15
00:00:32.64 --> 00:00:36.809
airline this is partly due to the

16
00:00:34.44 --> 00:00:38.219
efforts of its CEO Michael O'Leary he

17
00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.200
seems to have worked really hard to

18
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.660
become the man you love to hate with

19
00:00:40.2 --> 00:00:44.309
quotes like this one but we need fewer

20
00:00:42.66 --> 00:00:45.780
people queuing to go to the toilet how

21
00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.390
do you get fewer people queuing to go to

22
00:00:45.78 --> 00:00:51.300
the toilet charge them for us or how

23
00:00:48.39 --> 00:00:53.969
about this one wants to sit beside a

24
00:00:51.3 --> 00:00:55.800
really fat ass on board we have been

25
00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.230
frankly astonished at the number of

26
00:00:55.8 --> 00:01:00.120
customers who don't only want to tax fat

27
00:00:58.23 --> 00:01:01.680
people but torture them well there's

28
00:01:00.12 --> 00:01:03.030
actually another reason people hate Ryan

29
00:01:01.68 --> 00:01:04.559
Aaron if you've been following this

30
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:06.210
channel all my others you might already

31
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.840
know that I live in Prague in the Czech

32
00:01:06.21 --> 00:01:08.729
Republic

33
00:01:06.84 --> 00:01:10.799
now I parners on this channel they live

34
00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.390
over in Madrid in Spain and until this

35
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.869
very month the cost of a flight to go

36
00:01:12.39 --> 00:01:17.820
from here in Prague to Madrid cost about

37
00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.770
250 American dollars but this year well

38
00:01:17.82 --> 00:01:21.900
run air came down and they managed off

39
00:01:19.77 --> 00:01:24.119
of Prague to Madrid roots for about 90

40
00:01:21.9 --> 00:01:25.680
dollars and what did the other airline's

41
00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.140
do in response to this well they were

42
00:01:25.68 --> 00:01:29.939
also forced to lower their prices and

43
00:01:28.14 --> 00:01:31.740
this didn't just happen between Prague

44
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.380
and Madrid this happened all across

45
00:01:31.74 --> 00:01:36.240
Europe anywhere Ryanair operates the

46
00:01:34.38 --> 00:01:37.979
rest of its competitors hats put down

47
00:01:36.24 --> 00:01:40.590
their prices in order to remain

48
00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.160
competitive this meant lower profits or

49
00:01:40.59 --> 00:01:46.180
even potential bankruptcy

50
00:01:42.16 --> 00:01:48.490
[Music]

51
00:01:46.18 --> 00:01:50.620
just have a look British Airways in the

52
00:01:48.49 --> 00:01:52.240
year 2000 they carried over 46 million

53
00:01:50.62 --> 00:01:54.940
passengers but just eight years later

54
00:01:52.24 --> 00:01:56.500
they didn't even carry 33 million and of

55
00:01:54.94 --> 00:01:58.990
course those big airlines like British

56
00:01:56.5 --> 00:02:01.150
Airways or Lufthansa or Iberia they

57
00:01:58.99 --> 00:02:02.530
spent a fortune buying ads in the media

58
00:02:01.15 --> 00:02:05.080
and well because it will this ad buy

59
00:02:02.53 --> 00:02:06.520
they won the love of journalists sands

60
00:02:05.08 --> 00:02:07.840
well you know who didn't have much love

61
00:02:06.52 --> 00:02:09.940
for journalists well that would be

62
00:02:07.84 --> 00:02:12.310
Ryanair because they never really bought

63
00:02:09.94 --> 00:02:14.260
any ads well despite this bad reputation

64
00:02:12.31 --> 00:02:16.060
there are only a few companies that can

65
00:02:14.26 --> 00:02:18.790
claim to have changed an entire industry

66
00:02:16.06 --> 00:02:21.280
the way that Brian Eyre did and as I

67
00:02:18.79 --> 00:02:23.080
said before this is not only a European

68
00:02:21.28 --> 00:02:25.870
thing the Ryanair effect can be felt

69
00:02:23.08 --> 00:02:32.950
around the world except perhaps in Latin

70
00:02:25.87 --> 00:02:35.530
America so the first question we have to

71
00:02:32.95 --> 00:02:36.010
ask here is how did Ryanair change the

72
00:02:35.53 --> 00:02:38.260
world

73
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:40.600
wider regions like Latin America need a

74
00:02:38.26 --> 00:02:42.610
company like this and most important of

75
00:02:40.6 --> 00:02:45.220
all how does Ryanair manage to offer

76
00:02:42.61 --> 00:02:46.300
these ludicrously low prices well today

77
00:02:45.22 --> 00:02:48.160
we are going to answer all those

78
00:02:46.3 --> 00:02:50.540
questions but first let's take a look

79
00:02:48.16 --> 00:02:53.810
back at the history

80
00:02:50.54 --> 00:02:55.819
why is Ryanair so cheap back in the

81
00:02:53.81 --> 00:02:58.220
1980s a Madrid to London flight cost the

82
00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.319
equivalent of 700 dollars back then in

83
00:02:58.22 --> 00:03:03.079
Spain this was the average monthly wage

84
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.520
everyone understood that flying well it

85
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.490
was a luxury

86
00:03:04.52 --> 00:03:09.560
[Music]

87
00:03:07.49 --> 00:03:11.420
I mean at the end of the day planes

88
00:03:09.56 --> 00:03:12.770
they're really expensive and there

89
00:03:11.42 --> 00:03:14.540
wasn't really anything anyone could do

90
00:03:12.77 --> 00:03:16.220
nevertheless the reason why it flights

91
00:03:14.54 --> 00:03:18.170
for that expensive actually had little

92
00:03:16.22 --> 00:03:23.870
to do with the technology and it had

93
00:03:18.17 --> 00:03:25.670
much more to do with politics yes this

94
00:03:23.87 --> 00:03:26.990
really is true because back then air

95
00:03:25.67 --> 00:03:29.180
routes they were based on agreements

96
00:03:26.99 --> 00:03:30.800
between governments for instance the

97
00:03:29.18 --> 00:03:31.730
French government and the American one

98
00:03:30.8 --> 00:03:33.530
they had a deal

99
00:03:31.73 --> 00:03:36.110
so only French and American Airlines

100
00:03:33.53 --> 00:03:38.570
could fly between Paris and New York

101
00:03:36.11 --> 00:03:41.030
City the same happens with the rest of

102
00:03:38.57 --> 00:03:42.890
the European countries Airlines they had

103
00:03:41.03 --> 00:03:45.790
essentially a monopoly over the routes

104
00:03:42.89 --> 00:03:45.790
that they operated

105
00:03:49.18 --> 00:03:52.810
so there really was no incentive for

106
00:03:51.25 --> 00:03:54.879
them to lower fares because they could

107
00:03:52.81 --> 00:03:56.680
simply make a fortune selling $700

108
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.569
tickets back then it was really only

109
00:03:56.68 --> 00:04:01.299
British and Irish people who could enjoy

110
00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:08.620
Ryanair's lower fares but then in April

111
00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:10.959
of 1997 things they changed forever this

112
00:04:08.62 --> 00:04:13.209
month any technically qualified airline

113
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.189
in the European Union plus Norway and

114
00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.739
Iceland will be able to run services

115
00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.359
inside any other country all of a sudden

116
00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.160
all these European carriers they could

117
00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.470
compete against each other but they

118
00:04:21.16 --> 00:04:25.990
didn't really know how this is why they

119
00:04:23.47 --> 00:04:27.850
heavily invested in advertising and more

120
00:04:25.99 --> 00:04:29.710
luxuries they make that our food more

121
00:04:27.85 --> 00:04:32.169
comfortable seats and even gave

122
00:04:29.71 --> 00:04:34.539
corporate gifts to passengers Ronna

123
00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.100
instead they bet on a totally different

124
00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.730
strategy

125
00:04:36.1 --> 00:04:39.759
[Music]

126
00:04:36.73 --> 00:04:42.279
[Applause]

127
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:45.129
the other airlines are asking how they

128
00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.169
can put up fares we are asking how we

129
00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.539
could get rid of them saying this in

130
00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.460
1997 it was totally crazy of course

131
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.680
there were already over budget airlines

132
00:04:51.46 --> 00:04:55.900
like the American Airlines Southwest but

133
00:04:53.68 --> 00:04:57.669
rather they wanted to go even further

134
00:04:55.9 --> 00:05:00.039
this is why they found new ways to

135
00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.080
reduce the cost to an absolute minimum

136
00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.879
for example the landing cost depended

137
00:05:02.08 --> 00:05:05.680
partly on the fares with our lines paid

138
00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.020
to the airport's landing at Brussels

139
00:05:05.68 --> 00:05:09.789
central airports is costly but 60

140
00:05:08.02 --> 00:05:11.979
kilometers south there is Shana Roy

141
00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.899
Airport which offers way lower landing

142
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.589
fees simply by choosing to flight to

143
00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:18.779
that Airport

144
00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:18.779
Ryanair they saved a fortune

145
00:05:20.38 --> 00:05:24.760
another cost-saving policy was utilizing

146
00:05:22.69 --> 00:05:26.230
the same airplane model for all of the

147
00:05:24.76 --> 00:05:28.750
routes and this airplane

148
00:05:26.23 --> 00:05:31.090
it was the Boeing 737 other companies

149
00:05:28.75 --> 00:05:32.470
like Lufthansa they worked with over 14

150
00:05:31.09 --> 00:05:34.480
different types of airplanes

151
00:05:32.47 --> 00:05:36.790
this means they needed 14 maintenance

152
00:05:34.48 --> 00:05:38.770
technicians each of them specialized on

153
00:05:36.79 --> 00:05:40.840
a different model of aircraft rather

154
00:05:38.77 --> 00:05:42.580
instead they could do the same with just

155
00:05:40.84 --> 00:05:44.650
a few experts this means that while

156
00:05:42.58 --> 00:05:45.940
Lufthansa needed hours between flights

157
00:05:44.65 --> 00:05:52.000
to do maintenance checks

158
00:05:45.94 --> 00:05:53.980
Ryanair needed half that time and of

159
00:05:52.0 --> 00:05:55.510
course add to this the rest of the extra

160
00:05:53.98 --> 00:05:57.340
costs that they save during the flights

161
00:05:55.51 --> 00:05:58.630
do you want to eat on the airplane well

162
00:05:57.34 --> 00:06:00.820
that's extra do you want to carry on

163
00:05:58.63 --> 00:06:04.270
more baggage yeah that's extra to want

164
00:06:00.82 --> 00:06:06.460
to choose your seats every year Ryanair

165
00:06:04.27 --> 00:06:08.170
finds new ways to reduce costs for

166
00:06:06.46 --> 00:06:10.150
instance a few years ago on the backs of

167
00:06:08.17 --> 00:06:12.280
their seats they started posting adverts

168
00:06:10.15 --> 00:06:14.860
but the real turning points in this

169
00:06:12.28 --> 00:06:16.960
company came in the year 2000 this was

170
00:06:14.86 --> 00:06:19.210
the time when Michael O'Leary made a

171
00:06:16.96 --> 00:06:23.860
decision that changed the entire

172
00:06:19.21 --> 00:06:25.480
industry forever the travel agents take

173
00:06:23.86 --> 00:06:26.740
the out and shoot him what have

174
00:06:25.48 --> 00:06:29.200
they done for passengers over the last

175
00:06:26.74 --> 00:06:31.060
years in the year 2000 Ryanair was the

176
00:06:29.2 --> 00:06:33.070
first company to create a website where

177
00:06:31.06 --> 00:06:35.080
you could book tickets online prior to

178
00:06:33.07 --> 00:06:37.060
that it was impossible to buy your own

179
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:39.310
plane ticket unless you lived close to

180
00:06:37.06 --> 00:06:41.140
the airport so travel agents they were a

181
00:06:39.31 --> 00:06:42.700
pretty essential middleman and of course

182
00:06:41.14 --> 00:06:44.500
these travel agents they charged

183
00:06:42.7 --> 00:06:45.760
commissions and these commissions went

184
00:06:44.5 --> 00:06:47.920
up to 30%

185
00:06:45.76 --> 00:06:49.840
now instead passengers could just go to

186
00:06:47.92 --> 00:06:52.330
the website find the cheapest flight and

187
00:06:49.84 --> 00:06:54.610
then buy us today this is completely

188
00:06:52.33 --> 00:06:56.560
normal but back then it was a revolution

189
00:06:54.61 --> 00:06:58.300
and he put lots of travel agents out of

190
00:06:56.56 --> 00:07:00.730
business with all of this by the year

191
00:06:58.3 --> 00:07:03.430
2010 Ryanair could offer tickets for an

192
00:07:00.73 --> 00:07:04.960
average price of 40 US dollars I mean

193
00:07:03.43 --> 00:07:07.270
that's cheap but it's pretty ridiculous

194
00:07:04.96 --> 00:07:09.330
when you consider the $700 ticket that

195
00:07:07.27 --> 00:07:11.410
we were talking about before

196
00:07:09.33 --> 00:07:13.180
[Music]

197
00:07:11.41 --> 00:07:14.470
alright alright so now you might be

198
00:07:13.18 --> 00:07:16.660
wondering why are we saying cheap

199
00:07:14.47 --> 00:07:18.370
flights such a revolution that think

200
00:07:16.66 --> 00:07:20.080
about it since Ryanair expanded its

201
00:07:18.37 --> 00:07:22.660
business in Europe the amount of

202
00:07:20.08 --> 00:07:24.130
passengers has tripled pay attention to

203
00:07:22.66 --> 00:07:30.070
the chart here because we're talking

204
00:07:24.13 --> 00:07:31.540
about much more than tourism here thanks

205
00:07:30.07 --> 00:07:34.210
to cheap flights students exchange

206
00:07:31.54 --> 00:07:36.370
programs have multiplied by five since

207
00:07:34.21 --> 00:07:38.530
2007 in fact if you are watching this

208
00:07:36.37 --> 00:07:40.030
video from anywhere in Europe you might

209
00:07:38.53 --> 00:07:42.190
have studied abroad with an Erasmus

210
00:07:40.03 --> 00:07:44.200
program or have a friend who did and the

211
00:07:42.19 --> 00:07:46.660
same goes for labour mobility which is

212
00:07:44.2 --> 00:07:48.010
tripled in a decade it would be hard to

213
00:07:46.66 --> 00:07:49.810
measure all the small businesses that

214
00:07:48.01 --> 00:07:51.790
have been born thanks to cheap flights

215
00:07:49.81 --> 00:07:53.710
they can even allow the most modest

216
00:07:51.79 --> 00:07:56.160
freelancer to find clients in another

217
00:07:53.71 --> 00:07:56.160
country

218
00:07:57.01 --> 00:08:00.980
but hold on for just a minute because

219
00:07:59.12 --> 00:08:02.840
there's another detail that we must keep

220
00:08:00.98 --> 00:08:04.700
in mind here if you look carefully you

221
00:08:02.84 --> 00:08:06.950
will see that while flying has increased

222
00:08:04.7 --> 00:08:09.500
in Europe Latin America seems to be

223
00:08:06.95 --> 00:08:11.360
immune to those changes and didn't I

224
00:08:09.5 --> 00:08:11.870
just say that the Ryanair effects it was

225
00:08:11.36 --> 00:08:13.370
worldwide

226
00:08:11.87 --> 00:08:19.010
I mean well what happens in Latin

227
00:08:13.37 --> 00:08:21.230
America the Ryanair effect I know you're

228
00:08:19.01 --> 00:08:22.760
thinking Ryanair just operates in Europe

229
00:08:21.23 --> 00:08:24.740
I mean how could they have such a big

230
00:08:22.76 --> 00:08:26.750
influence on the rest of the world well

231
00:08:24.74 --> 00:08:28.640
I'll let you draw your own conclusions

232
00:08:26.75 --> 00:08:30.230
take AirAsia they were an airline owned

233
00:08:28.64 --> 00:08:32.090
by the Malaysian government at the

234
00:08:30.23 --> 00:08:34.730
beginning of the 2000s they were on the

235
00:08:32.09 --> 00:08:36.710
verge of bankruptcy then in 2001 the

236
00:08:34.73 --> 00:08:39.230
Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes

237
00:08:36.71 --> 00:08:40.970
bought it and followed the Ryanair model

238
00:08:39.23 --> 00:08:42.800
that had started to work in Europe

239
00:08:40.97 --> 00:08:44.960
AirAsia they adopted the slogan now

240
00:08:42.8 --> 00:08:47.120
everyone can fly and they offered to the

241
00:08:44.96 --> 00:08:49.580
first low-cost flights on the continents

242
00:08:47.12 --> 00:08:55.070
suddenly Kuala Lumpur to Macau could be

243
00:08:49.58 --> 00:08:56.960
done for less than $90 as happened in

244
00:08:55.07 --> 00:08:59.090
Europe Asia then saw the birth of many

245
00:08:56.96 --> 00:09:01.280
other low-cost airlines from Lyon air of

246
00:08:59.09 --> 00:09:03.620
Indonesia to Cebu Pacific in the

247
00:09:01.28 --> 00:09:05.690
Philippines even a country as poor and

248
00:09:03.62 --> 00:09:09.940
as big as India has seen at the amount

249
00:09:05.69 --> 00:09:09.940
of passengers tripled in just 10 years

250
00:09:11.25 --> 00:09:14.430
but hold on again for just a minute

251
00:09:13.17 --> 00:09:16.320
because there's still that part of the

252
00:09:14.43 --> 00:09:18.420
planet which seems immune to the Ryanair

253
00:09:16.32 --> 00:09:20.220
effects and this area as we mentioned

254
00:09:18.42 --> 00:09:21.990
well it's Latin America for example a

255
00:09:20.22 --> 00:09:24.870
cheap flight between Bogota in Colombia

256
00:09:21.99 --> 00:09:27.300
and Mexico City costs four hundred and

257
00:09:24.87 --> 00:09:29.130
sixty dollars just compare that with the

258
00:09:27.3 --> 00:09:31.560
86 dollars that you could pay going from

259
00:09:29.13 --> 00:09:33.330
Kuala Lumpur to Taipei and in case you

260
00:09:31.56 --> 00:09:35.900
want to check the distance both are more

261
00:09:33.33 --> 00:09:35.900
or less the same

262
00:09:37.43 --> 00:09:41.430
and the saying goes if you want to go

263
00:09:39.45 --> 00:09:43.610
from Lima in Peru to La Paz in Bolivia

264
00:09:41.43 --> 00:09:46.650
this is a three hour flight and it costs

265
00:09:43.61 --> 00:09:48.780
$600 and yes this is more than the

266
00:09:46.65 --> 00:09:50.940
average monthly wage in most Latin

267
00:09:48.78 --> 00:09:53.730
American countries so now you might be

268
00:09:50.94 --> 00:09:55.740
wondering why is it so damn expensive to

269
00:09:53.73 --> 00:09:57.780
fly in Latin America why don't they have

270
00:09:55.74 --> 00:10:00.210
some Ryanair like company the answer

271
00:09:57.78 --> 00:10:02.100
lies again in politics in other words

272
00:10:00.21 --> 00:10:04.170
legislation in the region has made it

273
00:10:02.1 --> 00:10:11.310
impossible for a Ryan airline company to

274
00:10:04.17 --> 00:10:13.710
appear if an airline wants to work in

275
00:10:11.31 --> 00:10:15.870
Brazil they need to have at least 20% of

276
00:10:13.71 --> 00:10:17.910
their capital owned by Brazilians and

277
00:10:15.87 --> 00:10:20.160
two years ago this percentage it was

278
00:10:17.91 --> 00:10:22.080
even higher this is why when Avianca or

279
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:23.370
a Colombian carrier wanted to open two

280
00:10:22.08 --> 00:10:25.770
markets in the country the government

281
00:10:23.37 --> 00:10:27.870
forced them to start a brand new company

282
00:10:25.77 --> 00:10:30.030
with their headquarters in Brazil thus

283
00:10:27.87 --> 00:10:32.250
of a young current Avianca Brasil are

284
00:10:30.03 --> 00:10:33.930
two entirely different companies despite

285
00:10:32.25 --> 00:10:35.550
the fact that they do belong to the same

286
00:10:33.93 --> 00:10:37.420
group but Brazil they're not the only

287
00:10:35.55 --> 00:10:38.380
country that protects their own Airlines

288
00:10:37.42 --> 00:10:42.410
[Music]

289
00:10:38.38 --> 00:10:45.290
[Applause]

290
00:10:42.41 --> 00:10:47.240
until the year 2016 Argentinians who

291
00:10:45.29 --> 00:10:50.000
wanted to fly could only choose between

292
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:52.490
two companies Argentina latam a private

293
00:10:50.0 --> 00:10:55.160
carrier and are really nice Argentina's

294
00:10:52.49 --> 00:10:57.140
a state-owned airline for decades the

295
00:10:55.16 --> 00:10:59.390
Cristina Fernandez the Kirsten

296
00:10:57.14 --> 00:11:01.250
administration made sure no other

297
00:10:59.39 --> 00:11:03.170
airline could compete with these

298
00:11:01.25 --> 00:11:04.520
airlines and the same goes for the

299
00:11:03.17 --> 00:11:06.500
airports another one they said that

300
00:11:04.52 --> 00:11:08.270
Ryanair could cut costs thanks to taking

301
00:11:06.5 --> 00:11:09.950
off at landing of cheap airports well

302
00:11:08.27 --> 00:11:11.750
this is possible in Europe but because

303
00:11:09.95 --> 00:11:13.490
of one out of every four airports are

304
00:11:11.75 --> 00:11:16.010
managed by a marriage between the

305
00:11:13.49 --> 00:11:18.640
government and private companies

306
00:11:16.01 --> 00:11:20.900
[Music]

307
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:22.190
thanks to this airports must compete

308
00:11:20.9 --> 00:11:24.590
with each other by offering better

309
00:11:22.19 --> 00:11:26.480
services and lower fares it's not by

310
00:11:24.59 --> 00:11:28.430
chance that half of European air traffic

311
00:11:26.48 --> 00:11:29.720
comes from private airports Latin

312
00:11:28.43 --> 00:11:31.700
America though it's a different story

313
00:11:29.72 --> 00:11:33.680
most of their airports are managed

314
00:11:31.7 --> 00:11:35.450
solely by the government's if there is

315
00:11:33.68 --> 00:11:37.400
no competition they simply have no

316
00:11:35.45 --> 00:11:39.230
interest in reducing fares in other

317
00:11:37.4 --> 00:11:40.700
words Ryan errors failed to have an

318
00:11:39.23 --> 00:11:42.290
effect on this region because of

319
00:11:40.7 --> 00:11:43.970
politics and well what are the

320
00:11:42.29 --> 00:11:45.230
consequences of this well despite the

321
00:11:43.97 --> 00:11:47.210
fact that there's many Latin American

322
00:11:45.23 --> 00:11:49.580
countries have grown economically in the

323
00:11:47.21 --> 00:11:52.700
past few years flying is still a

324
00:11:49.58 --> 00:11:54.470
privilege for the rich this is my vision

325
00:11:52.7 --> 00:11:57.350
I've been to the mountaintop I've seen

326
00:11:54.47 --> 00:11:58.850
the light so now the question becomes do

327
00:11:57.35 --> 00:12:00.710
you think Latin America should

328
00:11:58.85 --> 00:12:02.210
liberalize its airspace do you think

329
00:12:00.71 --> 00:12:04.250
that everyone could benefit from a

330
00:12:02.21 --> 00:12:06.440
company like Ryanair operating in his or

331
00:12:04.25 --> 00:12:07.880
her country well please do leave your

332
00:12:06.44 --> 00:12:09.230
answers in the comment section below

333

because we'd love to hear from you

334
00:12:09.23 --> 00:12:11.750
meanwhile if you want to know how

335
00:12:10.28 --> 00:12:13.310
Ireland stepped out of poverty and

336
00:12:11.75 --> 00:12:16.010
became the powerhouse that it is today

337
00:12:13.31 --> 00:12:18.110
well do click on this video also do
