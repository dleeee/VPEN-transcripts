00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,839
on the same day as the attack on Pearl

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,730
Harbor Japan carried out a combined

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,110
attack against Hong Kong the Philippines

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,030
Thailand and Malaysia that day was

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,100
December the 7th 1941 after taking

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,930
control of Hong Kong the Japanese army

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,670
imprisoned the colony's administrators

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,650
and many British and American citizens

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,539
in prison camps and they replaced the

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,189
Hong Kong dollar with the military yen

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,720
and confiscated all of the city's

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,309
manufacturing and commercial facilities

14
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,180
during the four years of Japanese

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,129
occupation Hong Kong's economy plummeted

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:40,890
so low that it was virtually ruins and

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,750
the population it was reduced by half

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,390
but finally on August the 15th 1945

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,309
after the harsh Pacific War the Second

20
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:47,730
World War

21
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,989
it ended Japan surrendered and Hong Kong

22
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,450
it was returned to the British

23
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,790
from that moment on a new story began it

24
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,620
was time for an economic takeoff there

25
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,270
was a process that would transform this

26
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,220
city into one of the freest and richest

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,080
territories in all of Asia and indeed

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,640
the entire planet

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,820

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,860
with seven and a half million

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,289
inhabitants and more than 1,200

33
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,420

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,820
benchmark of almost the entire Asian

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,409
continent for the past couple of decades

36
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,000
however this is changing

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
[Music]

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,850
you see located in the middle of the

39
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,810
Pearl River Delta

40
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,429
China's great technological and

41
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,500
industrial area is the city of Shenzhen

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,990
in 2018 Hong Kong saw its neighbor

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,880
Shenzhen known as the Chinese Silicon

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,799
Valley snatch first place as the city

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,240
with the largest economy in southern

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,420
China that's right Hong Kong is no

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,740
longer the biggest economy over the

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,909
cities that make up the Pearl River

49
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,049
Delta but this has a small caveat

50
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,479
Shenzhen has over 10 million inhabitants

51
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,119
which is 3 to 5 million more than Hong

52
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,920
Kong so in terms of wealth per capita

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,390
Hong Kong is still much richer but

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,920
that's beside the point because what

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,630
this shows us is that things are

56
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,849
changing and Hong Kong is falling behind

57
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,530
and that doesn't mean to say that the

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,180
city's economy isn't growing it's just

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,590
that Hong Kong's neighbors are growing

60
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,600
at a faster rate that and the fact that

61
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,620
while its neighbors particularly

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,209
Shenzhen have become important

63
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,160
technological industrial centres from

64
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,900
which multinationals as influential as

65
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,480
Tencent DJI or Huawei of emerged Hong

66
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,519
Kong is only significant as a financial

67
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,440
center and nothing more and the question

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,760
that more and more people are asking

69
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,010
themselves today is well is this a sign

70
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,470
of Hong Kong's decline or a sign of its

71
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,480
rebirth yep you heard that correctly it

72
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,980
is sort of a black and white situation

73
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:48,610
so listen up

74
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,650
the city of contrasts folks is my turn

75
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,850
to ask you a question are you ready

76
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,590
which city do you think has the most

77
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,570
ultra rich people living in it the city

78
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,250
with the highest number of people with

79
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,410
assets worth 30 million dollars or more

80
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,510
I'm guessing many of you thought of New

81
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,060
York London or maybe Dubai right well

82
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,680
cold cold and freezing New York eclipsed

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
as city with most extremely wealthy

84
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,510
people Hong Kong is now home to more

85
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,430
extremely rich people than any other

86
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,950
city in the world yep Hong Kong Hong

87
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,060
Kong is the city with the most

88
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,280
billionaires on the planet right now

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,380
more than 10,000 residents in this city

90
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,330
of a portfolio worth more than 30

91
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,660
million dollars how about that so many

92
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,250
of you might be thinking well if the

93
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,900
city is growing at around 3 percent per

94
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,250
year and it's the cities with the most

95
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,840
billionaires in the world then and

96
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,670
things are gonna be going pretty well

97
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,230
right well yeah

98
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,740
but also no folks

99
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,019
Hong Kong is a bit of a paradigm see on

100
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,910
the one hands we have an apparently

101
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,040
thriving and prosperous City a modern

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,260
and influential financial center to give

103
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,970
you an idea Hong Kong stock exchange is

104
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,060
absolutely huge it lists more than 2,300

105
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,560
companies with a total market value of

106
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,420
just over four point one trillion

107
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,160
dollars however at the same time this

108
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,410
city has a lot of problems the poorest

109
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,299
residents are earning progressively less

110
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,340
and less money infant mortality rates

111
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,350
are rising the population is aging

112
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,360
rapidly and a huge percentage of the

113
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,860
population lives in housing that falls

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,110
well short of building standards in any

115
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,760
developed country in many cases these

116
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
are tiny spaces that don't even have

117
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,960
windows or ventilation these could truly

118
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,340
be described as holes folks the most

119
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,530
plus truffaut Bukh living spaces in the

120
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,540
world can be found in this city and this

121
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,950
is a lot to do with the fact that what

122
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,990
should be a well-off middle-class really

123
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,990
isn't nearly half of Hong Kong flats

136
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,330
the folks we already talked about Hong

137
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,130
Kong's housing situation in a previous

138
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,990
video which I'm going to link to in the

139
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,180
description and before you jump the gun

140
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,440
I can already tell you that this has

141
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,810
nothing to do with capitalism gone wild

142
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,090
or corporate greed or overpopulation or

143
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,039
anything like that in this case it's

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,660
actually the government series to blame

145
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,430
because in Hong Kong the vast majority

146
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,900
of the lands and a good part of the

147
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
houses they belong to the government

148
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,440
they're all public but don't think that

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,539
that's the end of it this much much more

150
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,970
in October of 2018 the investment bank

151
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,419
Nomura

152
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,220
presented a report warning that they'd

153
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,080
likelihood that Hong Kong may suffer a

154
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,180
financial crisis in the coming years has

155
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,389
soared Hong Kong sits in the danger zone

156
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,449
for a fresh financial crisis one of the

157
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,430
main reasons for this is that a good

158
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,199
part of the population has taken huge

159
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,090
loans to buy a home therefore a very

160
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,800
high percentage of Hong Kong residents

161
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,240
particularly young professionals they're

162
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,270
up to their necks in mortgage debt Hong

163
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,639
Kong has very large credit and property

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,099
market overhangs since 2008 real

165
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,009
property prices have risen 125 percent

166
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:22,080
and the ratio of private non-financial

167
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,789
credit to GDP has surged to 299 percent

168
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,560
and if we add the fact that wages

169
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,419
haven't increased and the economy

170
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,070
depends greatly on China whose own

171
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,900
growth seems to be slowing down this

172
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,120
could be a recipe for disaster

I want to leave because Hong Kong is no

175
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,150
longer what it used to be my plan is to

176
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,099
get a masters degree in Canada find a

177
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,719
job and start a new life

180
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,259
yourself working endless days to live in

181
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,849
a tiny house which you have to pay a

182
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,770
huge mortgage leaves you very little

183
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,689
disposable income doesn't really make

184
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,460
you feel very optimistic at all and then

185
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,810
on top of that you can't set up anything

186
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,310
on your own because commercial space is

187
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,319
also incredibly expensive which makes

188
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,060
matters even worse well that's precisely

189
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,129
what more and more young Hong Kong

190
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,980
people are thinking check this out

192
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,690
according to a 2018 survey by Chinese

193
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,060
University of Hong Kong 51% of people

194
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,910
between the ages of 18 and 30 said that

195
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,560
they are thinking about leaving the

writer more than half of the young

198
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,650
population want to live somewhere else

199
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,750
and that's incredibly worrisome and then

200
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,190
we need to take into account China's

201
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,930
increasing political interference and

202
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,340
the growing restrictions on political

203
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,410
freedoms Hong Kong bans pro-independence

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,140

freedom in question as ft journalist

208
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,460
denied visa as you can see it wouldn't

209
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,050
be unreasonable to say that we're facing

210
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,090
something like the decline of Hong

211
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,990
Kong's splendour the city folks which

212
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,820
dazzled the world by becoming a

213
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,240
financial commercial and cultural center

214
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,789
[Applause]

215
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,710
for decades Hong Kong had the third

216
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,449
largest film industry in the world an

217
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,340
industry that was thought to even rival

218
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,830
Hollywood itself but hang on a second

219
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,719
because some argue that yeah all of this

220
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,370
has happened but now the city is about

221
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,140
to experience a rebirth so now the

222
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,610
question becomes the Hong Kong's best

223
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,340
days actually ahead of it

224
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:47,540
[Music]

225
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,709
the new Chinese Hong Kong we've told you

226
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,449
here on visual politic that the Chinese

227
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:56,369
president doesn't really like this whole

228
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,529
one country two systems' thing Xi

229
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,420
Jinping is determined to reduce Hong

230
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,980
Kong's political autonomy well to

231
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,600
achieve this he has presented a great

232
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,169
plan

233
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,929
the Great Bay metropolitan area project

234
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,160
you see the Chinese president wants to

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,350
turn the entire Pearl River Delta where

236
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,839
cities such as Hong Kong Macau Shenzhen

237
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,059
or crime Jo are located into a large

238
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,799
metropolitan area that is perfectly

239
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,779
interconnected and has immense economic

240
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,999
integration as we're talking about more

241
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:26,129
than 70 million people in a GDP that in

242
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,439
2030 according to morgan stanley will be

243
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,600
over three trillion dollars that's

244
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,009
larger than the economy of the entire UK

245
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,480
so far the big infrastructure projects

246
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
are already a reality a high-speed train

247
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,809
has already been inaugurated between

248
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,119
Hong Kong Shenzhen and Guangzhou and

249
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,160
also the longest bridge in the world now

250
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,230
connects Hong Kong and Macau this by the

251
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,699
way is a connection that is 55

252
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,410
kilometers long which understandably

253
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,540
cost an absolute fortune

254
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,560
the three regions including Hong Kong

255
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,860
and Guangdong Macau the problem the

256
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,360
Chinese government wants all this

257
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,940
integration to end Hong Kong's autonomy

258
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,740
and among other things although they are

259
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,870
formally a single country regulations

260
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,850
laws and courts the different in Hong

261
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,470
Kong than they are in mainland China

262
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,360
there are even borders and customs

263
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,390
between the two territories

264
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,830
so in order to make the metropolitan

265
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,840
area really work some harmonization

266
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,370
would have to take place which of course

267
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,080
means that Hong Kong would become

268
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,330
increasingly Chinese since that when its

269
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,700
autonomy agreement expires in 2047 it

270
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,350
wouldn't be renewed without strict

271
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,030
conditions needing to see all the pieces

272
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,060
now well there's still more

273
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,850
[Music]

274
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,130
in a spectacular turn of events China

275
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,410
has appointed Hong Kong as the national

276
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,450
center for technology and innovation in

277
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,890
southern China for the first time the

278
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,510
Chinese government has begun financing

279
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,070
research projects in Hong Kong's

280
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,870
universities they've demanded the

281
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,250
government's enforce a doubling of

282
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,990
research and development budgets and

283
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,610
have approved a program to attract

284
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,740
scientists and technologists from all

285
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,340
over the world

286
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,410
but well why we're trying to do this

287
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,660
well folks because Hong Kong has a huge

288
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,370
advantage over the rest of the Asian

289
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,440
continent it's considered a market

290
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,960
economy and it isn't subject to import

291
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,700
restrictions that is Hong Kong companies

292
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,710
can buy whatever they want including

293
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,000
high-tech goods that can have both

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,190
civilian and military applications these

295
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,810
are products that the government's and

296
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,760
Chinese companies cannot buy in other

297
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,320
words China wants to take advantage of

298
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,089
Hong Kong's status in order to boost its

299
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,310
technological development plans if it

300
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,930
succeeds that'll be great for China in

301
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,730
Hong Kong but even if that plan is

302
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,589
thwarted China will still get the other

303
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,480
hands with Hong Kong consider this if

304
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,980
the United States and the rest of the

305
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,270
other Western powers imposed

306
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,100
restrictions on Hong Kong and in their

307
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,140
Freeport status this will push the city

308
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,300
even more into China's hands who will be

309
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,920
happy to invest billions in this

310
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,900
territory in exchange for full control

311
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,330
Smart is real smart China

[Music]

313
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,320
anyway folks now you can probably see

314
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,370
it's hard to predict whether we're

315
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,170
facing Hong Kong's decline or whether

316
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,180
we're facing its rebirth but what does

317
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,400
seem clear is that Hong Kong will become

318
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,130
more and more Chinese but now it's your

319
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,750
turn do you think Hong Kong will see a

320
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,060
return to its glory days let us know in

321
