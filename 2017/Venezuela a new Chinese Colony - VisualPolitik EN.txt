00:00:06.5 --> 00:00:11.730
if you had to invest your money in

3
00:00:09.42 --> 00:00:14.429
another country I'm sure Venezuela

4
00:00:11.73 --> 00:00:16.830
wouldn't even be on the list right well

5
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.380
give you a Chinese government it does

6
00:00:16.83 --> 00:00:24.750
not agree with you China agrees to

7
00:00:22.38 --> 00:00:26.880
invest 20 billion dollars in Venezuela

8
00:00:24.75 --> 00:00:28.769
to help offset effects of oil price

9
00:00:26.88 --> 00:00:31.320
slump but hold on just a second because

10
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.450

12
00:00:33.45 --> 00:00:38.340
those banks that symbolizes American

13
00:00:35.46 --> 00:00:40.350
capitalism that its purest well they too

14
00:00:38.34 --> 00:00:46.140

maduras Venezuela Goldman buys 2.8

16
00:00:46.14 --> 00:00:50.910
billion dollars worth of Venezuelan

17
00:00:48.18 --> 00:00:52.440
bonds and an uproar begins yes you heard

18
00:00:50.91 --> 00:00:53.780
that right well Venezuela is having one

19
00:00:52.44 --> 00:00:56.550
of the worst economic catastrophe

20
00:00:53.78 --> 00:00:58.680
humanity has ever witnessed they keep

21
00:00:56.55 --> 00:01:00.989
making deals with the world's biggest

22
00:00:58.68 --> 00:01:03.239
investors this is why it despite the

23
00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.640
scarcity the extreme poverty and the

24
00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.619
hyperinflation Nicolas Maduro is buying

25
00:01:05.64 --> 00:01:09.540
state-of-the-art weapons to maintain an

26
00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.600
army that almost in nobody could attack

27
00:01:09.54 --> 00:01:14.549
an army that has over 5,000 rockets that

28
00:01:12.6 --> 00:01:16.409
were manufactured in Russia in October

29
00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.750
of this year that's 2017

30
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.310
Maduro met with Vladimir Putin to buy

31
00:01:18.75 --> 00:01:22.440
weapons

32
00:01:20.31 --> 00:01:25.180
[Music]

33
00:01:22.44 --> 00:01:27.280
meanwhile Venezuela is also the biggest

34
00:01:25.18 --> 00:01:29.500
partner that China has in the region

35
00:01:27.28 --> 00:01:31.930
they have received way more Chinese

36
00:01:29.5 --> 00:01:33.490
money than any other Latin American

37
00:01:31.93 --> 00:01:35.110
country all right so now you might be

38
00:01:33.49 --> 00:01:37.570
wondering well what's the point of all

39
00:01:35.11 --> 00:01:40.869
of this well finance wise China is

40
00:01:37.57 --> 00:01:43.119
pretty blind to ideology and of sin goes

41
00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.729
for those American banks their only goal

42
00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.470
is to make money but a first sighs I

43
00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.450
mean Venezuela it doesn't exactly look

44
00:01:47.47 --> 00:01:54.610
like a great place to do business so how

45
00:01:52.45 --> 00:01:57.399
did Venezuela come to the attention of

46
00:01:54.61 --> 00:01:59.440
so many investors I mean where is the

47
00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.420
deal here well today we are going to

48
00:01:59.44 --> 00:02:03.100
answer all of those questions but before

49
00:02:01.42 --> 00:02:08.530
we do let's take a look back at the

50
00:02:03.1 --> 00:02:09.880
history a risky bet okay so here's some

51
00:02:08.53 --> 00:02:11.590
advice if you ever want to become a

52
00:02:09.88 --> 00:02:13.000
dictator in your country and repress

53
00:02:11.59 --> 00:02:14.019
your opponents and torture your many

54
00:02:13.0 --> 00:02:16.090
political foes

55
00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.760
there is something you absolutely need

56
00:02:16.09 --> 00:02:20.410
and yes of course that is money yeah

57
00:02:18.76 --> 00:02:22.690
normal citizens can die from starvation

58
00:02:20.41 --> 00:02:25.510
that your police in your army cannot

59
00:02:22.69 --> 00:02:28.980
miss a single payday this is the biggest

60
00:02:25.51 --> 00:02:28.980
problem for enough therawtarian.com

61
00:02:29.43 --> 00:02:35.540
presidents his biggest problem is if the

62
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:38.460
army decides to strike against it

63
00:02:35.54 --> 00:02:39.960
[Music]

64
00:02:38.46 --> 00:02:41.760
but if you've been following visual

65
00:02:39.96 --> 00:02:43.950
politic for a long time you know that

66
00:02:41.76 --> 00:02:45.990
Venezuela has almost no private

67
00:02:43.95 --> 00:02:48.300
companies say there's not much money to

68
00:02:45.99 --> 00:02:50.520
be collected in taxes further oil

69
00:02:48.3 --> 00:02:53.100
exports are no longer profitable since

70
00:02:50.52 --> 00:02:54.600
the oil prices went down in 2012 in

71
00:02:53.1 --> 00:02:56.970
other words his only way to pay for this

72
00:02:54.6 --> 00:03:00.950
whole repressive apparatus is by getting

73
00:02:56.97 --> 00:03:00.950
loans on the international market

74
00:03:03.52 --> 00:03:08.110
but hold on just a second because things

75
00:03:05.77 --> 00:03:09.760
are not as easy as they seem Venezuela

76
00:03:08.11 --> 00:03:12.130
is a country with terrible economic

77
00:03:09.76 --> 00:03:14.020
problems this means if you lends the

78
00:03:12.13 --> 00:03:16.480
money chances are you're never going to

79
00:03:14.02 --> 00:03:19.360
get it back this is why we say that

80
00:03:16.48 --> 00:03:21.220
Venezuelan bonds are a very high risk

81
00:03:19.36 --> 00:03:23.260
investments and while what two countries

82
00:03:21.22 --> 00:03:25.270
do when investors don't trust them

83
00:03:23.26 --> 00:03:27.280
well they raise the interest rate and

84
00:03:25.27 --> 00:03:29.080
this is why Venezuelan bonds have a

85
00:03:27.28 --> 00:03:31.810
yield of over ten and twelve percent

86
00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:34.990
while a German bonds which is way more

87
00:03:31.81 --> 00:03:36.580
reliable doesn't surpass 0.5 percent all

88
00:03:34.99 --> 00:03:38.650
right so well what does all of this mean

89
00:03:36.58 --> 00:03:41.110
let's imagine we invest a thousand US

90
00:03:38.65 --> 00:03:43.180
dollars in Venezuela bonds to be paid in

91
00:03:41.11 --> 00:03:44.620
10 years with an interest of 10 percent

92
00:03:43.18 --> 00:03:46.600
theoretically the Venezuelan government

93
00:03:44.62 --> 00:03:48.610
is expected to give us back those

94
00:03:46.6 --> 00:03:51.250
thousand dollars that we led them but in

95
00:03:48.61 --> 00:03:52.720
the meantime who receive $100 every year

96
00:03:51.25 --> 00:03:53.950
as an interest payment well

97
00:03:52.72 --> 00:03:55.060
yes I probably guess we're thinking

98
00:03:53.95 --> 00:03:57.400
right now that sounds like a pretty

99
00:03:55.06 --> 00:04:00.240
great business well do not get excited

100
00:03:57.4 --> 00:04:00.240
just yet

101
00:04:02.85 --> 00:04:07.380
as we said before Venezuela has a pretty

102
00:04:05.55 --> 00:04:09.150
high chance of default if the

103
00:04:07.38 --> 00:04:11.940
governments of Caracas the capital of

104
00:04:09.15 --> 00:04:14.190
Venezuela declares bankruptcy in say two

105
00:04:11.94 --> 00:04:16.380
years we're going to have lost 80% of

106
00:04:14.19 --> 00:04:18.540
our investment this is why despite the

107
00:04:16.38 --> 00:04:20.489
high interest rates Nicolas Maduro has

108
00:04:18.54 --> 00:04:24.090
found it harder and harder to sell his

109
00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.640
bonds and well this explains news like

110
00:04:24.09 --> 00:04:31.770
this Goldman Sachs Venezuela bond

111
00:04:29.64 --> 00:04:33.300
purchase sparks anger it paid about

112
00:04:31.77 --> 00:04:36.360
eight hundred and sixty five million

113
00:04:33.3 --> 00:04:38.520
dollars for 2.8 billion dollars worth of

114
00:04:36.36 --> 00:04:40.680
bonds alright alright so what does this

115
00:04:38.52 --> 00:04:42.870
mean well it means Goldman Sachs bought

116
00:04:40.68 --> 00:04:45.330
Venezuelan bonds for a third of their

117
00:04:42.87 --> 00:04:47.220
value in other words theoretically the

118
00:04:45.33 --> 00:04:49.800
governments of Venezuela is expected to

119
00:04:47.22 --> 00:04:51.990
pay back 2.8 billion dollars to Goldman

120
00:04:49.8 --> 00:04:55.320
Sachs despite the fact that they only

121
00:04:51.99 --> 00:04:56.910
paid 865 million u.s. dollars for them

122
00:04:55.32 --> 00:04:59.130
and so now you might be wondering well

123
00:04:56.91 --> 00:05:00.780
why does Venezuela accept this deal well

124
00:04:59.13 --> 00:05:02.280
the answer is simply because they need

125
00:05:00.78 --> 00:05:04.560
cash and they need it as soon as

126
00:05:02.28 --> 00:05:05.550
possible seconds they also know they're

127
00:05:04.56 --> 00:05:11.540
never going to pay it back

128
00:05:05.55 --> 00:05:13.400
[Music]

129
00:05:11.54 --> 00:05:15.260
right now you might be wondering well

130
00:05:13.4 --> 00:05:16.550
why did I cus lend them the money if

131
00:05:15.26 --> 00:05:19.070
they know they're not going to get it

132
00:05:16.55 --> 00:05:21.170
back where's the business appeal here so

133
00:05:19.07 --> 00:05:23.180
basically this appeal rise in interest

134
00:05:21.17 --> 00:05:25.400
rates I mean think about it if Venezuela

135
00:05:23.18 --> 00:05:26.510
gives Goldman Sachs 10% of those 2.8

136
00:05:25.4 --> 00:05:27.950
billion every year

137
00:05:26.51 --> 00:05:29.660
that means the bank will have covered

138
00:05:27.95 --> 00:05:31.880
their investments those eight hundred

139
00:05:29.66 --> 00:05:35.000
sixty five million dollars in less than

140
00:05:31.88 --> 00:05:35.600
three years and after that everything's

141
00:05:35.0 --> 00:05:37.370
profit

142
00:05:35.6 --> 00:05:43.640
now of course investors know the

143
00:05:37.37 --> 00:05:45.980
Venezuela is going to default the

144
00:05:43.64 --> 00:05:47.840
question here is when are they going to

145
00:05:45.98 --> 00:05:49.550
do it so investors they're making a

146
00:05:47.84 --> 00:05:51.260
high-risk that it if an escuela keeps

147
00:05:49.55 --> 00:05:53.150
paying for at least four years banks

148
00:05:51.26 --> 00:05:55.250
will win if they don't the banks will

149
00:05:53.15 --> 00:05:56.840
loose and the truth is Nicolas Maduro is

150
00:05:55.25 --> 00:05:59.000
the first one interested in not

151
00:05:56.84 --> 00:06:00.830
declaring bankruptcy on the one hand he

152
00:05:59.0 --> 00:06:03.050
needs to keep bankers on his side so he

153
00:06:00.83 --> 00:06:06.410
can pay his repression machinery on the

154
00:06:03.05 --> 00:06:08.540
other hand PDVSA Venezuela's state-owned

155
00:06:06.41 --> 00:06:11.010
oil company has several properties

156
00:06:08.54 --> 00:06:14.120
abroad

157
00:06:11.01 --> 00:06:14.120
[Music]

158
00:06:14.34 --> 00:06:18.150
factories and refineries in countries

159
00:06:16.47 --> 00:06:20.040
like Haiti and the Dominican Republic

160
00:06:18.15 --> 00:06:22.380
if Caracas defaults some of those

161
00:06:20.04 --> 00:06:24.000
investors might seize them this is why

162
00:06:22.38 --> 00:06:25.860
for several years Venezuela has

163
00:06:24.0 --> 00:06:27.000
prioritized their debt payments over

164
00:06:25.86 --> 00:06:29.190
anything else

165
00:06:27.0 --> 00:06:31.500
murderers foreign currency reserves went

166
00:06:29.19 --> 00:06:33.780
from more than 50 billion dollars to

167
00:06:31.5 --> 00:06:36.060
less than 10 billion and this explains

168
00:06:33.78 --> 00:06:42.660
why a magazine like Forbes said this

169
00:06:36.06 --> 00:06:44.220
about Venezuelan bonds in 2016 Venezuela

170
00:06:42.66 --> 00:06:46.530
might be the worst country in Latin

171
00:06:44.22 --> 00:06:48.960
America but it's barns look great indeed

172
00:06:46.53 --> 00:06:51.180
in the middle of 2017 Donald Trump had

173
00:06:48.96 --> 00:06:53.639
to pass a law banning American banks and

174
00:06:51.18 --> 00:06:55.800
hedge funds from investing in Venezuela

175
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.380
nonetheless no matter how badly Maduro

176
00:06:55.8 --> 00:07:03.510
tried his economy was weaker that he

177
00:06:58.38 --> 00:07:06.150
thought Venezuela to restructure foreign

178
00:07:03.51 --> 00:07:07.950
debt default looms as possibility yes

179
00:07:06.15 --> 00:07:09.570
you had that right goldman sachs and the

180
00:07:07.95 --> 00:07:11.520
rest of those hedge funds who bought

181
00:07:09.57 --> 00:07:13.979
venezuelan bonds at a discount price

182
00:07:11.52 --> 00:07:15.750
they've lost their bet nonetheless there

183
00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.270
is still one investor that is far from

184
00:07:15.75 --> 00:07:21.470
being worried and yes well of course

185
00:07:18.27 --> 00:07:21.470
we're talking about China

186
00:07:22.99 --> 00:07:28.010
China's puppet as we said at the

187
00:07:25.97 --> 00:07:30.350
beginning Venezuela is the country that

188
00:07:28.01 --> 00:07:32.480
received the most Chinese money in Latin

189
00:07:30.35 --> 00:07:34.850
America but unlike the private bankers

190
00:07:32.48 --> 00:07:39.320
China's government does not buy bonds on

191
00:07:34.85 --> 00:07:41.270
the market instead Xi Jinping had a

192
00:07:39.32 --> 00:07:43.460
personal meeting with Nicolas Maduro a

193
00:07:41.27 --> 00:07:45.950
meeting where they negotiated a very

194
00:07:43.46 --> 00:07:48.740
special deal alone that is not to be

195
00:07:45.95 --> 00:07:50.660
paid back with money but with oil

196
00:07:48.74 --> 00:07:53.570
this way Beijing makes sure they have an

197
00:07:50.66 --> 00:07:54.860
oil supplier no matter what happens but

198
00:07:53.57 --> 00:07:57.200
hold on a second too because this

199
00:07:54.86 --> 00:07:59.510
formula it's got its drawbacks - as you

200
00:07:57.2 --> 00:08:01.730
know PDVSA is a hyper bureaucratic

201
00:07:59.51 --> 00:08:04.650
company with thousands of workers hired

202
00:08:01.73 --> 00:08:07.710
by shares out of pure nepotism

203
00:08:04.65 --> 00:08:07.710
[Music]

204
00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:12.590
this means oil drilling is harder and

205
00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:14.749
harder for them in fact lately those

206
00:08:12.59 --> 00:08:17.779
dinosaur juice shipments are arriving

207
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:20.330
pretty late to China but despite all of

208
00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:25.069
that China keeps them loyalty to

209
00:08:20.33 --> 00:08:26.629
Venezuela we are showing solidarity with

210
00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:28.219
the Venezuelan people because we are

211
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:33.050
supporting the principles of the United

212
00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:35.479
Nations this is what we have to do so

213
00:08:33.05 --> 00:08:37.399
now the question becomes well why what

214
00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.990
is China get from Venezuela now that

215
00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:41.510
they are facing problems with their oil

216
00:08:38.99 --> 00:08:43.579
payments well the answer it lies in the

217
00:08:41.51 --> 00:08:45.529
long run just think about it Beijing has

218
00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:47.990
already lent 50 billion dollars to

219
00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:50.560
Caracas now they just need patience and

220
00:08:47.99 --> 00:08:50.560
stability

221
00:08:51.21 --> 00:08:54.840
Midori needs some years to pay back is

222
00:08:53.16 --> 00:08:56.910
dead well no rush preaching mingling

223
00:08:54.84 --> 00:08:58.980
wait however there is something that

224
00:08:56.91 --> 00:09:01.890
could risk the payback of these debts

225
00:08:58.98 --> 00:09:03.480
and that is of changing government what

226
00:09:01.89 --> 00:09:05.490
would happen if the opposition to

227
00:09:03.48 --> 00:09:07.200
Nicolas Maduro took power would they be

228
00:09:05.49 --> 00:09:09.120
willing to meet their obligations to

229
00:09:07.2 --> 00:09:10.860
those who it helps the dictator the one

230
00:09:09.12 --> 00:09:13.050
who sent them to jail and probably

231
00:09:10.86 --> 00:09:15.870
tortured them sounds like a pretty risky

232
00:09:13.05 --> 00:09:18.000
proposition and well risk is the least

233
00:09:15.87 --> 00:09:20.760
favorite word for the Chinese Communist

234
00:09:18.0 --> 00:09:22.970
Party and it explains things like this

235
00:09:20.76 --> 00:09:22.970
one

236
00:09:23.91 --> 00:09:28.570
Venezuela defends purchase of Chinese

237
00:09:26.47 --> 00:09:30.700
riot control gear after more than 70

238
00:09:28.57 --> 00:09:32.920
deaths in street protests China has

239
00:09:30.7 --> 00:09:35.290
already sold over 350 million dollars

240
00:09:32.92 --> 00:09:36.490
worth of weapons to Maduro so that he

241
00:09:35.29 --> 00:09:38.200
can stay in power

242
00:09:36.49 --> 00:09:39.880
thanks to these movements Caracas is

243
00:09:38.2 --> 00:09:41.980
China's biggest ally in the region

244
00:09:39.88 --> 00:09:44.350
basically the Venezuelan government is

245
00:09:41.98 --> 00:09:47.200
to become the puppet of the Chinese

246
00:09:44.35 --> 00:09:48.910
Communist Party so well what happens

247
00:09:47.2 --> 00:09:50.890
well maybe China wants to build new

248
00:09:48.91 --> 00:09:52.210
infrastructure in South America so they

249
00:09:50.89 --> 00:09:54.250
can complete their Silk Road project

250
00:09:52.21 --> 00:09:55.840
well no problem I mean Venezuela

251
00:09:54.25 --> 00:09:57.550
diplomats will support them with no

252
00:09:55.84 --> 00:09:59.140
questions asked maybe China wants to

253
00:09:57.55 --> 00:10:01.360
have a military base in the region well

254
00:09:59.14 --> 00:10:03.010
welcome to Venezuela just like that

255
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:05.710
they'll get thousands of square miles to

256
00:10:03.01 --> 00:10:07.870
place their army as they please in other

257
00:10:05.71 --> 00:10:09.880
words well there's no better Ally than

258
00:10:07.87 --> 00:10:12.180
the one that needs you in order to

259
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:12.180
survive

260
00:10:12.37 --> 00:10:17.180
Venezuela hopes no country hinders

261
00:10:14.87 --> 00:10:19.339
China's fantastic Silk Road initiative

262
00:10:17.18 --> 00:10:21.920
nonetheless there is still doubt here

263
00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:24.290
having as much power as they have China

264
00:10:21.92 --> 00:10:26.180
might request other kinds of reforms for

265
00:10:24.29 --> 00:10:28.070
instance if Venezuela keeps facing

266
00:10:26.18 --> 00:10:29.959
problems with their oil payments they

267
00:10:28.07 --> 00:10:32.870
might force Maduro to fire people at

268
00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:34.700
PDVSA and make it more productive they

269
00:10:32.87 --> 00:10:35.580
could even take over the exploitation of

270
00:10:34.7 --> 00:10:38.890
the all themselves

271
00:10:35.58 --> 00:10:41.680
[Music]

272
00:10:38.89 --> 00:10:44.260
so the question here is can Venezuela

273
00:10:41.68 --> 00:10:46.570
become China's colony do you think China

274
00:10:44.26 --> 00:10:48.430
is going to seize Venezuelan oil forever

275
00:10:46.57 --> 00:10:49.900
well we'd love to know your answer and
