2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,790
the woman you see on the screen now is

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,430
Alexandria occasio Cortez a politician

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,530
who wants to turn America into a sort of

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,869
New Sweden I am running to fight for

6
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:17,000
improved and expanded Medicare for all a

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,130
federal jobs guarantee she is the

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,630
youngest congresswoman in American

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,160
history and one of the most well known

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,560
faces of the Democratic Party she openly

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,780
defines herself as a Democratic

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,619
Socialist

13
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,180
she has millions of Twitter followers

14
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,210
and well millions of critics too both

15
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,730
inside and outside of her own party

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,559
thing about in a country like the United

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,510
States the word socialist brings up

18
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,579
images of Soviet dictatorship

19
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,500
nevertheless in a moment when the

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,300
Democrats are having an identity crisis

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,489
her narrative seems to be a winning

22
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,320
formula of the next election but what

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,079
does Akzo Cortes really stand for what

24
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,450
is democratic socialism all about well

25
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,710
in this video we're going to tell you

26
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,770
[Applause]

27
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:05,020
a few months ago we published a visual

28
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,460
politic video about the ideological

29
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,410
shift in the Republican Party after

30
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,510
Trump's victory in 2016

31
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,160
something similar is happening in the

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,200
Democratic Party - at the end of the day

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,330
when a political party loses an election

34
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,970
its members wonder why and this is when

35
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,580
the ideological brainstorming starts

36
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,810
[Music]

37
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,850
in this case we're talking about a brand

38
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,950
new generation of Democratic politicians

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,170
mainly young women that have broken all

40
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,780
kinds of records for example Ilhan Omar

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,700
and Rashida to leave the first Muslim

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,710
women in Congress and in the case of

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,450
villain Omar the first congresswoman who

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,250
wears a headscarf too but we aren't just

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,280
talking about gender and age this new

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,590
wave of politicians is extremely social

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,090
media savvy ins that making

48
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,979
breakthroughs inside of the traditional

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,720
Democratic platform then again the most

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,270
famous of all of them is Alexandria

51
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,000
Acacio Cortez the poster child of

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,150
democratic socialism

53
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,980
as you can imagine okay zo Cortez soon

54
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,630
became the target of every critic from

55
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,880
the conservative side but make no

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
mistake even the old democratic guard is

57
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,410
not a big fan of hers for example one of

58
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,060
her biggest political projects is the

59
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,400
so-called green new deal this is a

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
package of social and ecological

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,940
policies but not even the Democratic

62
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,160
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi agrees

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,410
with it in some interviews she despises

64
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,630
it and this is surprising you in the

65
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,390
Takei Co Cortes and Pelosi belong to the

66
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,220
same political party and I know what

67
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,600
you're thinking democratic socialism

68
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,090
it's nothing new in America right at the

69
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,110
end of the days what Bernie Sanders

70
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,709
stood for back in 2016

71
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,769
and yeah you're right the difference is

72
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:45,750
that now though we aren't just talking

73
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,879
about one candidate but a whole movement

74
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,560
seems to be getting bigger and bigger

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,170
Sanders as leftist as he was on economic

76
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,579
issues tended to be much more

77
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,590
conservative on social ones for example

78
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,389
he was not big on anti gun laws

79
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,370
immigration or even racial issues

80
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,319
nevertheless both occasion Cortes and

81
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,719
her colleagues mark a turning point in

82
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,639
democratic history and maybe they even

83
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,290
represent a turning point in American

84
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,480
political history too so now the

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,040
question becomes is it possible that one

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,810
of the most capitalist countries in the

87
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,879
world can turn into a socialist one and

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,590
what kind of socialism does occasio

89
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,470
Cortes propose is it really that similar

90
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,480
to the Nordic model that she claims to

91
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,099
defend well today we're going to answer

92
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,870
all of these questions but before we do

93
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,130
let's take a look back at the history

94
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,860
[Music]

95
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,520
new faces old ideas and an or many of

96
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,990
you might be thinking you probably think

97
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,730
come on Simon they can't be socialists

98
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,340
in the Democratic Party this is America

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,050
and all American politicians pretty much

100
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,970
agree on the basics right but is the

101
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,500
thing the Democratic Party is one of the

102
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,390
oldest parties in political history

103
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,310
they've been around for almost 200 years

104
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,890
this is more than enough time for them

105
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,420
to develop some ideological twists

106
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,010
for example during most of the 19th

107
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,590
century pro-slavery politicians were

108
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,450
Democrats even several decades after

109
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,430
Abraham Lincoln who by the way was the

110
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,960
first Republican president abolished

111
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,270
slavery many Democratic politicians kept

112
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:15,360
saying things like this if you organize

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,790
a Democratic Party with one plank and

114
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,150
only one plank namely this is a white

115
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,490
man's country the white man must govern

116
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,820
it Benjamin Tillman senator South

117
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,240
Carolina Democrat 1895 to 1918 of course

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,860
all of this has changed radically

119
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,290
nowadays the Democratic Party is seen as

120
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,480
the party of racial diversity but this

121
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,070
example it helps to illustrate how

122
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,320
parties can evolve ideologically

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,360
something similar happens with economics

124
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,280
during the 1930s Franklin Roosevelt

125
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
introduced radical changes to the

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
American system tax raises the welfare

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,770
state and lots of regulations for

128
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,020
companies all came into effect as the

129
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,060
Clinton and even the Obama

130
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,430
administration were much more moderate

131
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,320
[Music]

132
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,820
I'm a strong believer in the free market

133
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,460
and a strong believer in capitalism but

134
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,350
I'm also strong believer that there are

135
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,840
certain common goods that require and

136
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,180
have some regulation Barack Obama in

137
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,160
other words the Democratic Party holds a

138
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,110
huge range of ideologies that stretch

139
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,240
from the center to the left for example

140
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,980
Abigail Spann Berg is one of the

141
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,660
politicians who belongs to the so-called

142
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,390
Blue Dog Coalition this is the moderate

143
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,190
group but we also have the more radical

144
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,620
members and among those is our

145
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,810
protagonist today Alexandria occasio

146
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,240
Cortes during an interview with PBS she

147
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,890
was asked about the ends of capitalism

148
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,250
and this was her answer

149
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,410
I think that we're gonna see an

150
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,660
evolution in our economic system of an

151
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,730
unprecedented degree and it's hard to

152
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,340
say what direction that takes Alexandria

153
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,800
Ocasio Cortez but as we said before she

154
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
is not the only one for example

155
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,430
Ilhan Omar is the first Somali woman to

156
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,050
be elected to Congress and she

157
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,330
identifies as a Democratic Socialist -

158
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,950
nevertheless her proposals are so

159
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,780
extreme that not even the Socialists

160
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,400
want to put her in their group

161
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,560
why basically because of her position

162
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,120
against the Israeli settlements and the

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,830
military occupation of Palestine in

164
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,300
America this kind of position is

165
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,370
extremely controversial so yes we can

166
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,020
say that this new wave of Democratic

167
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,150
politicians is groundbreaking indeed

168
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,500
while we were making this video House

169
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,480
Democrats started investigating Deutsche

170
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,250
Bank for some loans that they made to

171
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,260
Donald Trump and they even claimed that

172
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,850
the bank was one of the world's biggest

173
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,280
money launderers and all of this is at a

174
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,810
time when primary elections are getting

175
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,800
closer and closer

176
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
many of these Congress women might

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,490
actually run as candidates this means

178
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,440
that the next American president might

179
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,440
be a self-proclaimed socialist but what

180
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,330
does democratic socialism really mean

181
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,840
well let's have a look shall we

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,770
[Music]

183
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,360
European imports if you're watching this

184
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,009
video from Europe I'm pretty sure you're

185
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,629
gonna be familiar with the words social

186
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,789
democracy in fact one of Europe's

187
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,590
biggest political parties is the social

188
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,750
democrat party but where does social

189
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,699
democracy come from well to find out

190
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,020
about that we need to travel back in

191
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,639
time to the beginning of the 20th

192
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,250
century in the end 1917 the Bolshevik

193
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,110
Revolution started in Russia all of a

194
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,610
sudden the biggest country in Europe

195
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,110
made a radical shift in their political

196
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,629
system and decided to go for a Marxist

197
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,190
Leninist approach what are the

198
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,020
principles of Marxism in this video we

199
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,520
published years ago we tell you what

200
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,979
Marxism is all about the thing is from

201
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,780
the very beginning those Bolsheviks had

202
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,840
an international aim

203
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,510
that's why in 1990 they created the

204
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,610
Comintern an organization to manage all

205
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,440
the communist parties worldwide their

206
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,419
goal was to help both with training and

207
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,430
funding of all the political parties

208
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,960
that wanted to follow in Russia's

209
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,790
footsteps in other words all of the

210
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,810
parties that wanted a communist

211
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,060
revolution but as it always happens in

212
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,370
life the devil is in the details and

213
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,990
there is a very important detail that we

214
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,340
need to cover when we talk about the

215
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,760
Communist revolution communists disdain

216
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,889
to conceal their views and aims they

217
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,660
openly declare that their ends can be

218
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,910
attained only by the forcible overthrow

219
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,820
of all existing social conditions

220
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,610
Communist Manifesto chapter 4 yep you

221
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,180
heard that right

222
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,370
communists wanted to end capitalism

223
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,570
through violence

224
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,220
and this is where the big break inside

225
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,650
of Marxism inspired movement started on

226
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,630
one hand we have the pure communist soup

227
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,400
wanted a revolution on the other hands

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,380
we have these so-called Social Democrats

229
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,820
with famous intellectuals and

230
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,010
politicians like rose from Luxembourg

231
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,900
basically Social Democrats wanted to end

232
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,789
capitalism using the tool set of a

233
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,779
liberal democracy

234
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,190
this means they wanted to run for

235
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,990
election little by little change the

236
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,640
laws until they achieved a socialist

237
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,589
system to the Russian communists Social

238
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,760
Democrats were betraying the

239
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,380
working-class if you sleep with the

240
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,360
enemy you will end up joining

241
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,009
the truth is Social Democrats worked

242
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,480
pretty well all over Europe at least

243
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,730
election wise and the region where they

244
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,680
were most successful was in the

245
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,930
Scandinavian countries Sweden Norway and

246
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,000
Denmark had social democratic

247
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
governments for decades this is why

248
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,819
these countries have very generous

249
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,410
welfare states with the universal health

250
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,290
care lots of public services and of

251
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,720
course high taxes and this is why many

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,980
of these democratic socialist

253
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,779
politicians say they're inspired by the

254
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,519
Nordic model chief among them is

255
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,180
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes of course it

256
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,709
makes sense at the end of the day

257
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:25,930
Denmark and Sweden a very rich countries

258
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,639
with wonderful standards of living I

259
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,660
mean who would want to live in

260
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,790
Copenhagen with a salary of $3,000 a

261
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,529
month free higher education and free

262
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,509
hospitals but the question we should ask

263
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,240
now is can we really say that the Nordic

264
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,100
countries a socialist well let's find

265
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,430
out the Nordic model communists got one

266
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,230
thing right if you play by the rules of

267
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,240
the bourgeoisie you'll end up becoming

268
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,009
one of them and this is exactly what

269
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,480
happened to all of those Social

270
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,459
Democratic parties little by little they

271
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,380
ended up abandoning Marxism and anti

272
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,660
capitalism you see the basic foundation

273
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,880
of Marxism is the social ownership of

274
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,319
the means of production despite what a

275
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,149
lot of people might say Marx wouldn't

276
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:05,529
have any problem with you owning an

277
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:06,759
iPhone or a house

278
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,800
these are consumption goods which you

279
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,959
use for yourself the problem comes when

280
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,029
you want to own things to produce other

281
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,620
things that you can sell in the market

282
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,660
these are the so-called means of

283
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,130
production naught means of capital

284
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,290
communists are against the private

285
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,300
ownership of those means so as I said

286
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,500
before we've got a video where we

287
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,480
explain what Marxism is all about you

288
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,500
can find it link to in the description

289
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,240
below and by the way remember if you're

290
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,860
interested in these kinds of topics do

291
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,090
you remember that we published brand new

292
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,590
videos every week so be sure to

293
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,810
subscribe to visual politic and hit that

294
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,790
Bell button so you won't miss any posts

295
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,280
but going back to today's story how do

296
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,290
you socialize the means of production

297
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,600
well you can achieve this in a lot of

298
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,580
different ways from nationalizing

299
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,470
companies to having cooperatives where

300
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,780
the workers are also shareholders why

301
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,010
now you might be wondering well bother

302
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,050
many state-owned companies in Sweden are

303
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,570
the many cooperatives the answer is not

304
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,110
really

305
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,070
in fact it's kind of the opposite

306
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,230
Sweden tops global privatization ranking

307
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,600
no country is privatized and deregulated

308
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,850
public services as fast as Sweden

309
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,740
according to a new report from the

310
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,850
conservative think-tank the Heritage

311
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,680
Foundation you see every year the

312
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,720
Heritage Foundation publishes a World

313
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,940
Economic Freedom ranking according to

314
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,130
this America is the 12th freest economy

315
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,790
on the planet

316
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,280
Denmark ranks in 14th and Sweden comes

317
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,710
in at 19th in the last two decades these

318
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,480
countries have made a lot of radical

319
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,700
free-market reforms in many respect you

320
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,350
might even argue that Sweden is even

321
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,060
more capitalist than America once an

322
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,230
example we'll take a look at the

323
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,390
educational system the United States was

324
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,800
of the first countries to provide

325
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,870
universal access to education this

326
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,700
education is provided through public

327
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,500
schools which are funded and managed by

328
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,110
the federal government or the states

329
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,670
[Music]

330
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,050
Sweden is a different animal they have

331
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,579
more and more private schools in

332
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:57,709
competition with the state-owned ones of

333
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:58,970
course the government guarantees

334
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,440
universal access but instead of

335
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,690
micromanaging education what they do is

336
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,550
give the money to the citizens so that

337
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,620
they can choose which school they want

338
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,690
their children to attend this is called

339
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,180
the school voucher system and it seems

340
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,490
like the country is turning to a similar

341
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,690
model when it comes to health gap

342
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,699
Denmark is following suits and of course

343
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,350
when it comes to the minimum wage these

344
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,670
countries don't have one

345
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,139
of course Denmark has a great

346
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,940
unemployment insurance program but there

347
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,740
is no minimum wage

348
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,449
so while occasio cortes wants to have a

349
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,149
$15 an hour minimum wage mysore it might

350
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,310
not be a good idea but it's definitely

351
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,899
got nothing to do with the nordic model

352
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,699
where the labour market is pretty

353
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,860
deregulated and this is why the danish

354
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,449
prime minister said this during an

355
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:43,310
official visit to america that some

356
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,110
people in the u.s. associate the nordic

357
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,029
model with some sort of socialism

358
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,920
therefore i would like to make one thing

359
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,740
clear Denmark is far from a socialist

360
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,170
planned economy Denmark is a market

361
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,060
economy

362
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,520
of course Denmark has higher income

363
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,440
taxes in America for example the top

364
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,450
marginal tax rate is 56 percent but this

365
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,300
also means less central government debt

366
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,650
has been required to support government

367
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,900
spending for example America's central

368
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,330
government debt surpassed 105 percent of

369
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,000
GDP this means that the US government

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,490
owes more than the total size of the

371
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,590
American economy each year in Denmark

372
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,900
this number is as low as 35 percent and

373
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,430
the same goes for the public deficit

374
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,930
while the White House spends more than

375
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,760
what they collect in taxes Denmark is

376
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,530
much more responsible and in the long

377
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,270
run this means much fewer problems and

378
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,160
much more stability this explains why

379
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,380
the Scandinavian economies are so

380
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,330
business friendly and so attractive to

381
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,340
foreign investors in fact big firms like

382
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,440
H&M the fashion retailer Spotify the

383
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,480
music streaming platform and many others

384
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,430
were born in Sweden which is a country

385
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,200
with a population as small as the state

386
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,540
of Georgia's of course any of occasion

387
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,310
cortezes or even Bernie Sanders as

388
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,920
stances on issues really do match the

389
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,360
nordic model for example everything

390
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,460
regarding Medigap but many others have

391
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,560
nothing to do with the Scandinavian

392
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
countries so now the question passes to

393
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,130
you do you think this brand new wave of

394
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,530
Democratic politicians can capture the

395
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,780
soul of their party well we see a new

396
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,030
ideological shift in the Democrats just

397
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,890
like what we witnessed in the Republican

398
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,660
Party well please leave your answer in
