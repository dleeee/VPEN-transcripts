00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,310
this video is brought to you by blinkers

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,929
look it's not always easy to find the

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,120
time to sit down and read all of the

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,670
books you want I'm a pretty busy dude so

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,380
I understand that and I don't read

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,480
nearly as much as I used to or as much

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,639
as I would want to but good news is I

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,470
have this blink estab which is an app

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,640
that you can download and it basically

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,740
just gives you 15 minute summaries of

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,490
all the best non-fiction books me I

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,529
actually listen to most of them because

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,359
as well as having written summaries they

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,460
also have audio versions which are

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,120
fantastic I basically just listen to

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,950
these in the moments in the day when I'm

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,110
like you know commuting to work or doing

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,730
the dishes stuff like that is when I

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,010
grab a listen to a quick clip from

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,469
Linkous 8 million people currently using

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,059
this app and it really does provide the

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,460
best insights from thousands of books on

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,379
here right now I've just been going

24
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,600
through again Stephen our cubbies the

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,710
seven Habits of Highly Effective People

26
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,390
I actually read the book a while ago

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,309
been using Linkous to get up-to-date on

28
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:57,750
it I've also got coming up with shark I

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,980
haven't read either of these but I'm

30
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,989
looking forward to the blinks is James

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,250
Donovan's shoot for the moon and

32
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,489
Gabrielle Weinberg and Lauren McCann's

33
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,560
super thinking so I'm gonna be checking

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,360
those out check out the seven Habits

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,390
that's a great one the first a hundred

36
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,799
people to go to blink is calm

37
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,390
forward-slash visual politic we'll get

38
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,970
one week to try it out you also get 25%

39
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,799
off if you go for the full membership

40
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,630
again that's a 7 day trial that you can

41
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,369
cancel at any time just go to blinkers

click the link in the description below

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,330
and let's get into it

45
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,880
[Applause]

46
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,640
[Music]

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,110
on paper they should be great allies

48
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,600
something like Batman and Robin or Frodo

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,850
and Sam but of international politics

50
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,080
hedonist or the Russia a dig in a

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,270
[Music]

52
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,000
[Applause]

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,950
let me explain Japan and South Korea are

54
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,360
relatively free countries in a

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,010
geopolitical environments that has some

56
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,020
very unusual conditions they share

57
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,820
partners face the same threats and have

58
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,220
strong economic ties sounds like a

59
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,630
pretty good match but here's more

60
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,670
we're talking about two countries that

61
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,470
have the same strategic Ally the United

62
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,420
States which currently has a total of

63
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,070
eighty thousand soldiers deployed in

64
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,160
Japan and Korea virtually full Army in

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
addition both countries face the same

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,820
challenges and the same threats mainly

67
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,950
an aging population as well as growing

68
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,870
economic political and military weight

69
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,960
from both North Korea and China and

70
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,590
that's not all

71
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,450
with bilateral trade that exceeds 80

72
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,520
billion dollars per year and a transit

73
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,770
of more than ten million tourists Japan

74
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,780
and South Korea's economies are very

75
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,610
interrelated so as you can see they take

76
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,370
all of the boxes to be very good friends

77
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,080
what's more together South Korea and

78
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,510
Japan form a much stronger bloc than you

79
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,480
could imagine we're talking about a

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,100
block that has a hundred and seventy

81
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,350
seven million inhabitants an industrial

82
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,060
production that doubles that of Germany

83
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,820
and is five times that of France and it

84
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,770
has the third largest military budget on

85
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,600
the entire planet standing just behind

86
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,880
the United States and China together

87
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,100
they spend more than ninety billion

88
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,950
dollars each year on defense

89
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,470
in other words if you had to work as

90
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,390
consultants for these two governments

91
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,220
you're surely advise them to strengthen

92
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,770
their ties and work side by side right

93
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,860
well just a second because theory is one

94
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,810
thing that the reality is something

95
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,370
altogether different the truth is that

96
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,130
Japan and South Korea really do not get

97
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,380
along and that explains news stories

98
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,540
like this incident causes a surge in

99
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,319
tension between South Korea and Japan

100
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,209
forget North Korea is the next showdown

101
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:54,420
in Asia Japan versus South Korea and now

102
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,550
more than ever this topic is a hot one

103
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,340
need some proof I'll check this out

104
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,959
according to a study conducted in July

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,310
of 2019

106
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,380
no less than 74 percent of Japanese

107
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,080
people reported a distrust of South

108
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,850
Koreans and apparently the feeling is

109
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,010
mutual 75 percent of South Koreans

110
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,530
distrust the Japanese but of course it

111
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,419
doesn't end there at the beginning of

112
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:20,790
July 2019 the Japanese government's

113
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,040
unleashed a sort of trade war against

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
South Korea more specifically it

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
restricted the exports of freaky

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,250
products to South Korean industry

117
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,800
chlorinated polyamide hydrogen fluoride

118
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,740
and photo protectors

119
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,140
okay so you might never have heard of

120
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,370
these things but we're talking about

121
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,470
three chemicals that are essential for

122
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,850
manufacturing things such as

123
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,980
semiconductors and smartphone screens

124
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,350
and these are two components of which

125
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,910
South Korea is one of the largest

126
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,280
manufacturers and exporters on the

127
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,750
planet in fact we could say that

128
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,000
semiconductors up something like South

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,420
Korea's oil South Korea is the world

130
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,280
leader when it comes to chip making and

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,500
Japan is a world leader in the

132
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,750
manufacturing of key materials for chip

133
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,270
making on kihyun vice president of the

134
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,640
korea semiconductor industry association

135
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,010
and no it doesn't in there either at the

136
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,150
beginning of august

137
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,070
japan announced new restrictions which

138
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,260
may not be the last but before we

139
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,700
continue I think we need to ask

140
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,800
ourselves some questions what exactly is

141
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,430
going on

142
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,590
why did Japan unleash such a conflict

143
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,360
with one of its biggest trading partners

144
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,320
what consequences could it have

145
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,289
[Music]

146
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,669
the reconciliation that never arrives to

147
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,590
understand the entire story we need to

148
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,629
go back to the beginning of the 20th

149
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:47,680
century from 1910 until the end of World

150
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,229
War two in 1945 Korea was a Japanese

151
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,629
colony these weren't exactly happy years

152
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:54,610
for the Koreans the Japanese Empire

153
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,650
ruled Korea with an iron fist

154
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,240
there was a great deal of repression a

155
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
large amount of crimes were committed

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,229
and many lands were de facto expropriate

157
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,849
errs to give you an idea while the South

158
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,860
Korean people went hungry lots of the

159
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,599
agricultural production was sent to

160
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,479
Japan and there's more during the

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,099
Japanese occupation hundreds of

162
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,870
thousands of South Koreans were forcibly

163
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,819
recruited to work in brutal Semmy

164
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,159
slavery conditions in Japanese industry

165
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,440
and mines Stanford University estimates

166
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,319
that this included more than 700,000

167
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,250
South Koreans but here this is horrible

168
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,289
well hold on because things are about to

169
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,569
get even worse during World War two tens

170
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,610
of thousands of South Korean women were

171
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,500
forced to practice the oldest trade in

172
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,750
the world in order to satisfy Japanese

173
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,300
soldiers it's estimated the between

174
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,310
50,000 and 200,000 women were victims of

175
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,460
this atrocity this all explains why

176
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,529
seven decades later Japan and South

177
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:49,990
Korea continued to fight over what the

178
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,279
occupation meant a local government near

179
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,440
Seoul is calling for all Japanese made

180
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
school products to be affixed with a

181
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,550
sticker saying they were made by quote

182
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,830
war criminals of course in South Korea

183
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,110
regained its independence in 1945 there

184
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,849
have been several attempts to reconcile

185
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,460
and hand the page the two most important

186
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,669
ones happened in 1965 and 2015 and both

187
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,890
had the same results

188
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,150
[Music]

189
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,250
you see in 1965 when South Korea was a

190
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,560
dictatorship led by Park chung-hee both

191
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,750
countries agreed to end all disputes

192
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,150
Japan assumed its responsibility and

193
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,470
promised to pay the South Korean

194
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,389
government's the equivalent of 2.4

195
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,430
billion dollars as compensation and

196
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,710
another 1.6 billion in low-interest

197
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,810
loans so was everything sorted well no

198
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,210
in 2012 South Korea's Supreme Court

199
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,069
recognized the victims right to obtain

200
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,650
individual compensation and not from the

201
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,150
Japanese government but from the

202
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,220
Japanese companies that were involved in

203
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,639
the forced labor cases the fact is that

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,340
in 2018 the South Korean supreme court's

205
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,169
ruling led companies such as Nippon

206
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,360
Steel Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,280
the Nazi Party Koshi corporation to pay

208
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,979
between 70,000 and 90,000 dollars to

209
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,169
each of the two dozen victims who'd made

210
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,970
a claim at the courts and that's where

211
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,800
it all really lies the ruling ordered

212
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,630
compensation for the victims of their

213
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,490
living relatives because of course some

214
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,830
had already passed away and here lies

215
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,330
the heart of the matter can you imagine

216
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,949
if the same thing happens with all of

217
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:23,720
the other forced workers living or dead

218
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,310
if their families could make a claim

219
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,630
today we'll be talking about

220
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,940
compensation amounting to billions of

221
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,800
dollars which of course Japan has no

222
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,079
intention of paying because among other

223
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,789
things from their point of view this

224
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,740
whole issue has already been resolved by

225
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,729
the 1965 agreements on the other hands

226
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,070
in 2015 both governments agreed that

227
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,839
Japan would create a fund of about 9

228
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,670
million dollars to compensate the women

229
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,120
who were enslaved during World War two

230
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,649
but you know what this agreement it was

231
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:54,970
also worthless why well listen up

[Music]

233
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:05,819
the bigger fire strategy the South

234
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,379
Korean economy is not going so great

235
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,119
right now we've talked about it here on

236
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,949
visual politic previously and I'll leave

237
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,479
a link to that video in the description

238
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,669
since moon jae-in came to power things

239
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:17,399
have been unravelling almost as fast as

240
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,649
snapchat photos disappear and of course

241
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,299
the president's own popularity has

242
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,439
followed closely behind the economy

243
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,399
according to polls moon jae-in's

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,559
approval dropped from 83 percent in May

245
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,439
of 2018 to 45 percent just a year later

246
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,749
and not only that this is also a time

247
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,489
when economic affairs are gaining more

248
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,649
and more power the South Korean leaders

249
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,049
economic management plummeted down to 30

250
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:43,799
percent and well here's a question for

251
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,599
you what do you do if you have a huge

252
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,249
fire but you want people to look the

253
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,529
other way well you make an even bigger

254
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,359
fire I didn't make that up it is truly

255
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,069
one of the oldest tricks in all of

256
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,290
politics

257
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,020
[Music]

258
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,450
and that's exactly what wound Ryan seems

259
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,310
to be doing pouring gasoline onto

260
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,840
another fire now this doesn't actually

261
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,550
seem to have been too hard because since

262
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,130
he reached power in 2017 monde Ryan has

263
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,860
always been focused on Japan in fact one

264
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,510
of his first actions was to announce the

265
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,820
unilateral and retroactive suspension of

266
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,950
the 2015 agreement and since then

267
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,540
tensions between the two countries

268
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,870
they've only grown on some examples well

269
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,730
check this out in the last year we've

270
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,830
witnessed increasingly controversial and

271
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,780
almost provocative political statements

272
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,430
from the South Korean government against

273
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,900
Japan further South Korean intelligence

274
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,820
has stopped sharing the information it

275
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,100
has with Japan in December 2018

276
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,990
according to Japanese sources a South

277
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,120
Korean frigate set its shooting radar on

278
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
a Japanese plane shortly after Seoul

279
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,960
prevented Japanese Defense Force ships

280
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,640
from using its ports and even as

281
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,830
recently as the beginning of 2019 we've

282
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,390
seen a boycott on the purchase of

283
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,490
Japanese products which was instigated

284
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,180
by the South Korean government itself so

285
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,950
if what he's looking for is a fight the

286
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,660
South Korean president couldn't be doing

287
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,480
a better job my lateral relationship

288
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,820
right now is about as bad as it has ever

289
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,790
been and it is continuing to deteriorate

professor of international relations at

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,050
Korea University the point is that moon

293
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,820
jaein didn't think that Japan would

294
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,800
respond with such strength well maybe he

295
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,460
did

tactic using Commerce as a launching

weapon in international political

302
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,930
further they are using the trade war to

303
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,300
punish an allied man has had enough and

304
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,130
Shinzo our they can't deal with it

305
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,490

wins all their pending quarrels have

308
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,110
gone too far

309
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,030
the 1965 agreements the apologies of

310
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,690
1990 1991 and the 2015 agreements Tokyo

311
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,280
they're not willing to make any more

312
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,610
concessions now of course the fact that

313
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,230
the Prime Minister himself is considered

314
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,510
revisionist doesn't help we also talked

315
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,040
about that rather recently in another

316
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,780
video the fact is that at the beginning

317
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,200
of July

318
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,700
the Japanese government decided to

319
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,560
punish Korea with restrictions on the

320
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,240
three components we mentioned before

321
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,790
fluorinated polyamide hydrogen fluoride

322
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,380
and photo protectors we're talking about

323
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,660
a measure that if not reverse soon could

324
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,610
cause great problems for some South

325
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,190
Korean giants like Samsung or SK Hynix

326
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,540
to have the world's largest

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,640
semiconductor manufacturers at the

328
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,810
beginning of August the Japanese

329
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,970
government communicated its decision to

330
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,130
remove South Korea from its white list

331
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,990
of 27 countries that have preferential

332
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,910
commercial status basically the

333
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,800
countries on this list can buy most

334
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,810
Japanese technology and products freely

335
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,700
and without restrictions this means that

336
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,590
to buy practically any product except

337
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,540
food and wood South Korean companies

338
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,280
will have to comply with the Japanese

339
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,140
government's approval process which not

340
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,790
only involves more bureaucracy and

341
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,560
import costs it also means the Japanese

342
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,300
government now has the right end of the

343
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,910
stick there is they can veto any sale to

344
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,010

346
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,070

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,810
deep commercial relations between the

348
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,820

sounds like a bit of an excuse of course

366

375
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,560
of course at this point the question we

376
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,630
have to ask is does it make sense to

377
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,340
resort to commercial warfare as a

378
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,650
foreign policy weapon well the truth is

379
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,080
that experience and evidence say no you

380
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,550
see now the South Korean government

381
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,900
isn't only responding with its own

382
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,030
sanctions they're also putting a lot of

383
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,770
money on the table to reduce their

384
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,580
dependence on Japanese companies in a

385
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,080
way it's similar to what happens with

386
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,540
China in 2011 back then the Chinese

387
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,250
government restricted the sale of rare

388
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,530
lands to Japan and well what do you

389
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,300
think the Japanese did they invested in

390
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,280
their own mines in the end China's

391
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,020
market share decreased in Japanese

392
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,190
taxpayers better to pay for it that is

393
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,890
the outcome was just bad for everyone so

394
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,440
yes this time Shinzo our base shot might

395
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,720
backfire again anyway what is most

396
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,310
likely is that Japan and Korea will

397
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,530
sooner or later return to the starting

398
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,810
point and continue this endless spiral

399
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,110
of grievances you know what it would be

400
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,610
really good if they could just settle

401
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:16,470
this matter once and for all

402
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,300
the block

403
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,200
a close alliance between South Korea and

404
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,460
Japan would frankly be a very good thing

405
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,810
they would form an economic and

406
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,490
political bloc with a great deal of

407
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,230
influence for example that have free

408
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,180
trade with China which Japan and South

409
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,250
Korea are jointly negotiating progress

410
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,170
is slowed down now with moon jaein but

411
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,850
once it is settled it will create an

412
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,490
even wider area for trade this would be

413
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,610
great for everyone

414
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,900
on a political level that become a

415
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,790
beacon in an area of the world that is

416
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,620
full of dictatorships and at a military

417
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,540
level they'd be able to offset China's

418
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
weight

419
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,650
but of course to achieve all this is

420
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,120
absolutely necessary that both

421
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,160
governments reach an agreement once and

422
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,350
for all leave the past behind and focus

423
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,520
on the future

424
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,720
