2
00:00:07.22 --> 00:00:12.420
it's the world's largest population the

3
00:00:10.23 --> 00:00:14.820
second largest economy mit has one of

4
00:00:12.42 --> 00:00:16.890
the largest multi currency reserves the

5
00:00:14.82 --> 00:00:19.560
second largest military budget the

6
00:00:16.89 --> 00:00:21.600
number one trade power globally but it's

7
00:00:19.56 --> 00:00:23.519
better known as the world's factory

8
00:00:21.6 --> 00:00:26.099
these are just a few of the reasons that

9
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.510
China has become a superpower now if

10
00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.769
you're a regular viewer of visual

11
00:00:27.51 --> 00:00:30.960
politic you'll know that we've done

12
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
several videos on this country we've

13
00:00:30.96 --> 00:00:34.770
discussed its foreign policy its debt

14
00:00:32.79 --> 00:00:36.899
issues we've discussed how its companies

15
00:00:34.77 --> 00:00:38.700
have grown all around the world as well

16
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.340
as its political system we've discussed

17
00:00:38.7 --> 00:00:43.250
Macau Hong Kong and suffice to say we've

18
00:00:41.34 --> 00:00:46.450
talked a lot about China

19
00:00:43.25 --> 00:00:46.450
[Music]

20
00:00:48.25 --> 00:00:52.390
and we have done so because we believe

21
00:00:50.26 --> 00:00:54.400
that nowadays it is impossible as well

22
00:00:52.39 --> 00:00:56.350
as pretty inconvenient to discuss

23
00:00:54.4 --> 00:00:58.900
international politics without keeping

24
00:00:56.35 --> 00:01:00.490
in mind this huge global player however

25
00:00:58.9 --> 00:01:02.080
in all of those previous videos you

26
00:01:00.49 --> 00:01:04.000
could say that we've skipped a really

27
00:01:02.08 --> 00:01:07.150
important question and that question is

28
00:01:04.0 --> 00:01:08.440
really how powerful is China today well

29
00:01:07.15 --> 00:01:10.060
the good news is that's exactly the

30
00:01:08.44 --> 00:01:11.890
question we're going to be answering in

31
00:01:10.06 --> 00:01:13.810
this video and we're going to do it from

32
00:01:11.89 --> 00:01:16.000
three different perspectives military

33
00:01:13.81 --> 00:01:17.680
economic and political and look even

34
00:01:16.0 --> 00:01:19.540
though many people today think of China

35
00:01:17.68 --> 00:01:22.390
as the second most important global

36
00:01:19.54 --> 00:01:24.040
power not everyone agrees with this not

37
00:01:22.39 --> 00:01:26.080
at all in fact some experts believe that

38
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:28.930
when China's potential is carefully

39
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:31.000
examined well it's not actually all that

40
00:01:28.93 --> 00:01:33.160
powerful but then again there are plenty

41
00:01:31.0 --> 00:01:35.170
of other experts who stated that Chinese

42
00:01:33.16 --> 00:01:37.810
power is growing at an incredibly fast

43
00:01:35.17 --> 00:01:40.090
rate and that the 21st century is most

44
00:01:37.81 --> 00:01:41.710
certainly going to be China's century

45
00:01:40.09 --> 00:01:43.450
now before you get started we should

46
00:01:41.71 --> 00:01:46.000
establish one thing first and that's

47
00:01:43.45 --> 00:01:48.070
what exactly do we mean by power is it

48
00:01:46.0 --> 00:01:49.660
to have a lot of economic resources and

49
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:51.310
what about a big army or maybe it's

50
00:01:49.66 --> 00:01:53.200
actually to do with natural resources

51
00:01:51.31 --> 00:01:55.480
well social scientists consider

52
00:01:53.2 --> 00:01:58.060
political power to be found in leverage

53
00:01:55.48 --> 00:02:00.460
and influence that is essentially saying

54
00:01:58.06 --> 00:02:02.740
that power is the ability to shape and

55
00:02:00.46 --> 00:02:05.140
condition the events and actions of

56
00:02:02.74 --> 00:02:07.990
others so the question now becomes what

57
00:02:05.14 --> 00:02:10.000
is China's power what do they have in

58
00:02:07.99 --> 00:02:12.430
order to leverage and influence other

59
00:02:10.0 --> 00:02:14.200
countries well as I said a moment ago in

60
00:02:12.43 --> 00:02:16.930
this video we're going to examine the

61
00:02:14.2 --> 00:02:19.540
three main areas that most often deliver

62
00:02:16.93 --> 00:02:22.660
that power and that's weapons economics

63
00:02:19.54 --> 00:02:25.860
and politics and well how about we kick

64
00:02:22.66 --> 00:02:25.860
things off with war

65
00:02:28.69 --> 00:02:35.780
but dragons strength it isn't exactly

66
00:02:33.68 --> 00:02:37.760
easy to quantify the military strength

67
00:02:35.78 --> 00:02:39.140
of a country it depends on several

68
00:02:37.76 --> 00:02:41.120
different factors you have to consider

69
00:02:39.14 --> 00:02:42.770
how well protected the country is if its

70
00:02:41.12 --> 00:02:45.080
soldiers are well-trained or not how

71
00:02:42.77 --> 00:02:47.060
modern its arsenal is as well as a whole

72
00:02:45.08 --> 00:02:49.280
bunch of other factors however despite

73
00:02:47.06 --> 00:02:51.590
these different factors we can still say

74
00:02:49.28 --> 00:02:53.959
that the spending on defense is usually

75
00:02:51.59 --> 00:02:55.850
the best way to measure the military

76
00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.860
potential of a nation further when we

77
00:02:55.85 --> 00:02:59.870
analyze the money a country spends on

78
00:02:57.86 --> 00:03:02.450
its army we also get some other relevant

79
00:02:59.87 --> 00:03:04.430
information like how important a strong

80
00:03:02.45 --> 00:03:06.760
military is to the government so

81
00:03:04.43 --> 00:03:08.840
[Music]

82
00:03:06.76 --> 00:03:11.630
according to the official figures in

83
00:03:08.84 --> 00:03:14.090
2016 China spent around a hundred and

84
00:03:11.63 --> 00:03:15.530
forty six billion dollars on defense but

85
00:03:14.09 --> 00:03:17.510
as you can probably imagine China's

86
00:03:15.53 --> 00:03:19.040
government is not a shining example of

87
00:03:17.51 --> 00:03:20.840
transparency and some other sources

88
00:03:19.04 --> 00:03:24.709
indicated that the number could be

89
00:03:20.84 --> 00:03:26.750
closer to 226 billion anyway whichever

90
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.970
number is correct we do know that China

91
00:03:26.75 --> 00:03:31.820
has multiplied its defense spending by

92
00:03:28.97 --> 00:03:33.890
five in the last decade and it is today

93
00:03:31.82 --> 00:03:35.239
the second largest spending country in

94
00:03:33.89 --> 00:03:37.489
the world when it comes to defense

95
00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.150
spending trailing only behind the United

96
00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.150
States of course

97
00:03:40.47 --> 00:03:45.190
five times though it's a significant

98
00:03:43.21 --> 00:03:47.980
increase in such a short period of time

99
00:03:45.19 --> 00:03:50.530
however this hasn't been disrepair due

100
00:03:47.98 --> 00:03:52.600
to the country's GDP indeed spending has

101
00:03:50.53 --> 00:03:54.520
been closely related to the economic

102
00:03:52.6 --> 00:03:57.640
growth of the country having been kept

103
00:03:54.52 --> 00:03:59.620
within 2% of the overall GDP and that is

104
00:03:57.64 --> 00:04:01.540
not the end of it if we look at the

105
00:03:59.62 --> 00:04:03.790
public budget we can see how defense

106
00:04:01.54 --> 00:04:06.370
expenses have dropped from 12% of the

107
00:04:03.79 --> 00:04:10.150
public spending in 2001 to around a

108
00:04:06.37 --> 00:04:11.950
little more than 6% in 2016 and can you

109
00:04:10.15 --> 00:04:14.230
guess what that means well it means that

110
00:04:11.95 --> 00:04:16.120
China has made less of an effort when it

111
00:04:14.23 --> 00:04:18.250
comes to spending than the u.s. when you

112
00:04:16.12 --> 00:04:20.860
consider GDP and public spending as

113
00:04:18.25 --> 00:04:23.820
reference points so take a look at this

114
00:04:20.86 --> 00:04:23.820
chart for instance

115
00:04:24.56 --> 00:04:27.680
[Music]

116
00:04:28.6 --> 00:04:32.710
we already know two things first that

117
00:04:31.06 --> 00:04:34.240
Chinese military spending will keep

118
00:04:32.71 --> 00:04:35.950
growing at the same level the economy

119
00:04:34.24 --> 00:04:38.140
does which will gradually shrink that

120
00:04:35.95 --> 00:04:40.150
difference with the u.s. seconds we know

121
00:04:38.14 --> 00:04:42.010
that military spending is only a small

122
00:04:40.15 --> 00:04:44.080
burden to the Chinese economy we could

123
00:04:42.01 --> 00:04:45.640
say it is a sustainable amount and if

124
00:04:44.08 --> 00:04:47.500
the government needed to reduce it the

125
00:04:45.64 --> 00:04:48.640
government could manage to do so without

126
00:04:47.5 --> 00:04:50.200
in any problems

127
00:04:48.64 --> 00:04:52.570
however it's now important that we talk

128
00:04:50.2 --> 00:04:55.150
about military capability because when

129
00:04:52.57 --> 00:05:01.360
it comes to Chinese military power there

130
00:04:55.15 --> 00:05:04.720
are certain limitations what the dragon

131
00:05:01.36 --> 00:05:06.280
lacks China's potential to operate

132
00:05:04.72 --> 00:05:09.100
military force outside of their borders

133
00:05:06.28 --> 00:05:11.590
is actually pretty low unlike the United

134
00:05:09.1 --> 00:05:13.300
States China does not have any military

135
00:05:11.59 --> 00:05:15.430
bases abroad with the exception of

136
00:05:13.3 --> 00:05:17.710
Djibouti as we will see later on it also

137
00:05:15.43 --> 00:05:19.990
doesn't have that many allies either or

138
00:05:17.71 --> 00:05:21.820
a logistic network of satellites for

139
00:05:19.99 --> 00:05:23.200
large deployments it actually doesn't

140
00:05:21.82 --> 00:05:24.280
have much at all and then he must

141
00:05:23.2 --> 00:05:25.990
consider that they're also pretty

142
00:05:24.28 --> 00:05:27.790
inexperienced I mean it's been 40 years

143
00:05:25.99 --> 00:05:29.120
since the last time Chinese troops

144
00:05:27.79 --> 00:05:31.210
engaged in combat

145
00:05:29.12 --> 00:05:33.160
[Music]

146
00:05:31.21 --> 00:05:36.069
but does that mean that China is some

147
00:05:33.16 --> 00:05:38.470
sort of paper tiger well no absolutely

148
00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.000
not new resources are allowing Beijing

149
00:05:38.47 --> 00:05:42.789
to make important changes and

150
00:05:40.0 --> 00:05:44.860
investments China's growing military

151
00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.330
potential has changed the balance of

152
00:05:44.86 --> 00:05:48.039
forces in Asia and the People's

153
00:05:46.33 --> 00:05:50.080
Liberation Army is now capable of

154
00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.630
conducting operations on a global scale

155
00:05:50.08 --> 00:05:54.520
China is making changes they have

156
00:05:52.63 --> 00:05:57.160
reduced their military by 300,000

157
00:05:54.52 --> 00:05:59.050
soldiers since 2015 and too focused on

158
00:05:57.16 --> 00:06:01.060
military upgrades and their ability to

159
00:05:59.05 --> 00:06:02.979
operate abroad the Chinese army opened

160
00:06:01.06 --> 00:06:05.380
its first foreign military base in July

161
00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.930
of 2017 in the African country of

162
00:06:05.38 --> 00:06:10.030
Djibouti then in 2012 China bought its

163
00:06:07.93 --> 00:06:12.759
first aircraft carrier from Ukraine and

164
00:06:10.03 --> 00:06:14.320
in 2017 they completed their first two

165
00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.780
domestic carrier with more to follow

166
00:06:14.32 --> 00:06:20.620
it's also investing in missiles and its

167
00:06:16.78 --> 00:06:23.380
air force China has put into service its

168
00:06:20.62 --> 00:06:26.020
new generation g20 stealth fighter yes

169
00:06:23.38 --> 00:06:27.759
it is going to take decades at a minimum

170
00:06:26.02 --> 00:06:29.740
for the Chinese army to come close to

171
00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.990
the American army but there is certainly

172
00:06:29.74 --> 00:06:34.509
no other country out there with as much

173
00:06:31.99 --> 00:06:36.490
potential as China and we all better get

174
00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:40.860
used to having to deal with China when

175
00:06:36.49 --> 00:06:40.860
talking about global military strategy

176
00:06:42.0 --> 00:06:47.870
the economic power

177
00:06:45.5 --> 00:06:49.940
there is no way to sustain any political

178
00:06:47.87 --> 00:06:51.680
or military power without economic

179
00:06:49.94 --> 00:06:52.070
capacity but there's more to it than

180
00:06:51.68 --> 00:06:54.290
that

181
00:06:52.07 --> 00:06:56.420
economic power has its own great

182
00:06:54.29 --> 00:06:58.460
potential to influence other governments

183
00:06:56.42 --> 00:06:59.870
and large companies and this is what is

184
00:06:58.46 --> 00:07:01.430
happening for instance with direct

185
00:06:59.87 --> 00:07:03.860
foreign investments which is both

186
00:07:01.43 --> 00:07:05.210
entering and leaving China as a clear

187
00:07:03.86 --> 00:07:07.220
financial figure amount this is not

188
00:07:05.21 --> 00:07:09.560
actually very high just yet but year

189
00:07:07.22 --> 00:07:11.810
after year this figure has grown and

190
00:07:09.56 --> 00:07:13.280
grown in a previous visual politic video

191
00:07:11.81 --> 00:07:15.620
we looked at how in the last few years

192
00:07:13.28 --> 00:07:23.750
Chinese companies have started to invest

193
00:07:15.62 --> 00:07:25.790
money around the world in 2016 excluding

194
00:07:23.75 --> 00:07:28.700
Hong Kong and Macau this amount was more

195
00:07:25.79 --> 00:07:30.590
than 180 billion dollars thanks to this

196
00:07:28.7 --> 00:07:32.030
China is gained influence especially in

197
00:07:30.59 --> 00:07:33.770
developing countries that have seen

198
00:07:32.03 --> 00:07:36.250
quite the opportunity in this Chinese

199
00:07:33.77 --> 00:07:36.250
money

200
00:07:40.43 --> 00:07:44.449
and it's the same sort of thing with

201
00:07:41.9 --> 00:07:46.460
trades but here China is by far the

202
00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.740
leading global power and we're not just

203
00:07:46.46 --> 00:07:50.479
talking about Chinese exports here we're

204
00:07:48.74 --> 00:07:52.250
talking about imports a lot to pay

205
00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.660
attention here because Chinese economic

206
00:07:52.25 --> 00:07:55.940
growth has created a more prosperous

207
00:07:53.66 --> 00:07:58.220
middle class every day more than a

208
00:07:55.94 --> 00:08:00.830
hundred and eighty thousand people the

209
00:07:58.22 --> 00:08:02.750
poverty behind and become a part of the

210
00:08:00.83 --> 00:08:03.830
middle class that has enough money to

211
00:08:02.75 --> 00:08:05.479
well spent

212
00:08:03.83 --> 00:08:07.699
and this diva is something that has

213
00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:11.360
caused many multinationals to make China

214
00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:13.400
the number one priority that is

215
00:08:11.36 --> 00:08:15.830
certainly the case of BMW where one out

216
00:08:13.4 --> 00:08:18.530
of every four cars sold by this company

217
00:08:15.83 --> 00:08:21.169
is sold in China a country where sales

218
00:08:18.53 --> 00:08:23.389
are now 50% larger than in the United

219
00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:25.039
States but there's still more Asian

220
00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:26.780
assembly lines occupying several

221
00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:28.639
countries for example Vietnam may

222
00:08:26.78 --> 00:08:31.039
produce one components while than other

223
00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:33.589
is made in South Korea and later they

224
00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:35.209
are all assembled in China the world's

225
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:36.860
great production center in the

226
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:39.650
asia-pacific region hundreds of

227
00:08:36.86 --> 00:08:44.630
thousands of jobs depends on trade with

228
00:08:39.65 --> 00:08:46.220
China okay but not everything looks so

229
00:08:44.63 --> 00:08:48.410
good there are problems too especially

230
00:08:46.22 --> 00:08:51.050
when it comes to technology design and

231
00:08:48.41 --> 00:08:53.959
innovation because well truth be told

232
00:08:51.05 --> 00:08:56.270
innovation and creativity don't usually

233
00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:58.580
get on with dictatorships but still

234
00:08:56.27 --> 00:09:00.350
things are changing and investment trade

235
00:08:58.58 --> 00:09:03.930
and multinationals are all things that

236
00:09:00.35 --> 00:09:11.260
generate a lot of influence in indeed

237
00:09:03.93 --> 00:09:15.000
[Music]

238
00:09:11.26 --> 00:09:15.000
a growing political power

239
00:09:15.54 --> 00:09:19.320
finally there is political power it's

240
00:09:17.85 --> 00:09:21.810
often said that China lacks leadership

241
00:09:19.32 --> 00:09:23.519
and further that's unlike the US which

242
00:09:21.81 --> 00:09:26.310
counts on solid allies all around the

243
00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:27.990
world China is some sort of lone wolf

244
00:09:26.31 --> 00:09:29.670
now this has been said for years but do

245
00:09:27.99 --> 00:09:32.399
you keep in mind that this is all

246
00:09:29.67 --> 00:09:33.959
beginning to change China has bet on

247
00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.209
increasing their influence on global

248
00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:39.800
politics and is doing that to defend

249
00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:42.779
interests that are increasingly global

250
00:09:39.8 --> 00:09:44.850
it is a clear strategy the Chinese are

251
00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:46.860
using their large currency reserves to

252
00:09:44.85 --> 00:09:48.959
expand their influence in the last

253
00:09:46.86 --> 00:09:51.269
decade alone Beijing has loaned money to

254
00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:53.850
several governments and has invested all

255
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:56.040
over the world from Fiji to Madagascar

256
00:09:53.85 --> 00:09:58.170
and that is not the end of it they have

257
00:09:56.04 --> 00:10:00.899
also set up ambitious plans to achieve

258
00:09:58.17 --> 00:10:02.670
their goals as an example the Asian

259
00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:04.470
infrastructure investment bank a

260
00:10:02.67 --> 00:10:06.420
financial power controlled by China and

261
00:10:04.47 --> 00:10:08.399
based in Beijing will reduce the

262
00:10:06.42 --> 00:10:10.500
influence of institutions like the World

263
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:12.300
Bank the IMF or the Asian Development

264
00:10:10.5 --> 00:10:14.760
Bank all of them controlled by

265
00:10:12.3 --> 00:10:16.649
Washington to some extent and how about

266
00:10:14.76 --> 00:10:18.839
some more examples well there's the New

267
00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:20.579
Silk Road the one road one belt the

268
00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:22.319
largest infrastructure project in the

269
00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:24.449
world then there is the China Investment

270
00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:26.639
Corporation a sovereign funds that

271
00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:28.709
manages more than eight hundred billion

272
00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:30.870
dollars and invests in companies all

273
00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:33.149
around the world and yes we didn't make

274
00:10:30.87 --> 00:10:35.579
a mistake there that is billion with a B

275
00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:38.130
so now you might be wondering has China

276
00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:40.110
actually had any political success with

277
00:10:38.13 --> 00:10:42.630
this strategy well the answer is yes

278
00:10:40.11 --> 00:10:45.329
they have and that is well demonstrated

279
00:10:42.63 --> 00:10:47.370
in the country of Greece China is

280
00:10:45.329 --> 00:10:49.110
developing enormous projects in this

281
00:10:47.37 --> 00:10:51.149
country like the Piraeus port or the

282
00:10:49.11 --> 00:10:52.070
Hellenic on they sort of Monaco in the

283
00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:55.239
heart of Athens

284
00:10:52.07 --> 00:10:55.239
[Applause]

285
00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:00.509
and well what's the result of all this

286
00:10:58.23 --> 00:11:03.089
well blast June 8th ins vetoed a

287
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:04.800
resolution that condemns the violation

288
00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:05.579
of Rights in China and it's not for the

289
00:11:04.8 --> 00:11:07.319
first time

290
00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:09.029
anyway China is still facing real

291
00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:11.639
challenges perhaps the biggest of these

292
00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:17.970
is its aging population I mean just have

293
00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:19.860
a look at this chart but despite this

294
00:11:17.97 --> 00:11:21.779
the influence of China and international

295
00:11:19.86 --> 00:11:23.879
politics will grow quite a lot in the

296
00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:25.829
next few years and China is already a

297
00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:27.269
new superpower and well that's our

298
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.980
opinion at visual politic and now we'd

299
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.730
love to know yours do you think China is

300
00:11:28.98 --> 00:11:31.889
a superpower

301
00:11:29.73 --> 00:11:33.600
or just a flash in the pan and do you

302
00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:35.100
think China should be included in the

303
00:11:33.6 --> 00:11:37.170
international community to a greater

304
00:11:35.1 --> 00:11:39.059
extent well as always you can leave your
