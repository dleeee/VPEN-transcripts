1
00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.100
any of you have asked us for a video

2
00:00:08.82 --> 00:00:13.710
explaining what communism is all about

3
00:00:11.1 --> 00:00:15.210
so well here it is if you have been

4
00:00:13.71 --> 00:00:17.279
following the channel for a while you'll

5
00:00:15.21 --> 00:00:20.189
probably know that we're not exactly on

6
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.509
the Communist side of the spectrum but

7
00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.699
before having an opinion about something

8
00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.109
it's important to be informed about this

9
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.089
plus at the end of this video we're

10
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.369
going to share some takeaways about Marx

11
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.929
that just might surprise you the

12
00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.630
internet is full of trolls who will

13
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.660
either sing Marxist praises or hate on

14
00:00:33.63 --> 00:00:41.430
him without ever having read and this is

15
00:00:39.66 --> 00:00:43.650
why people ends up believing quite a lot

16
00:00:41.43 --> 00:00:45.750
of stereotypes about communism that

17
00:00:43.65 --> 00:00:47.910
simply aren't true now before I start I

18
00:00:45.75 --> 00:00:50.130
will say that this is a summary of

19
00:00:47.91 --> 00:00:52.860
Friedrich angles and Karl Marx's ideas

20
00:00:50.13 --> 00:00:53.910
on communism only we've only got ten

21
00:00:52.86 --> 00:00:55.770
minutes here so it's going to be

22
00:00:53.91 --> 00:00:57.810
impossible to cover authors who came

23
00:00:55.77 --> 00:01:00.090
after all the politics of the Soviet

24
00:00:57.81 --> 00:01:04.920
Union but with that out of the way

25
00:01:00.09 --> 00:01:06.689
let's get started the first thing you

26
00:01:04.92 --> 00:01:10.499
need to know that may surprise you is

27
00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.689
that Marx was a materialist finger that

28
00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:16.009
means that he thinks the main driver of

29
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.329
social change is material goods the

30
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.759
foundation of our system is to determine

31
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.069
which goods have more value than other

32
00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.259
goods but do be warned here that we are

33
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.600
talking about value and not an ounce

34
00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.850
price price can be influenced by other

35
00:01:27.6 --> 00:01:31.850
things such as taxes or monopolies

36
00:01:32.13 --> 00:01:36.659
as your your value the marks the value

37
00:01:34.71 --> 00:01:39.509
of the good is measured by the work

38
00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.820
needed to manufacture so for an example

39
00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.799
how much is a chair where it would be

40
00:01:41.82 --> 00:01:45.539
the summers the carpenters working hours

41
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.920
you put the chair together as well as

42
00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.020
the some of the working hours of the

43
00:01:46.92 --> 00:01:50.670
lumberjack you cut down the tree as well

44
00:01:49.02 --> 00:01:52.590
as the some of the working hours of the

45
00:01:50.67 --> 00:01:55.289
blacksmith who made the nails that went

46
00:01:52.59 --> 00:01:58.049
into the chair and this goes on and on

47
00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.750
and on in summary it's all the work of

48
00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.149
all the people who went in and making

49
00:02:00.75 --> 00:02:05.700
the chair don't forget this because it's

50
00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.610
very important in understanding the idea

51
00:02:05.7 --> 00:02:10.440
of capitalist exploitation and though

52
00:02:08.61 --> 00:02:16.200
this has nothing to do with working

53
00:02:10.44 --> 00:02:19.080
hours or workers condition under Marx

54
00:02:16.2 --> 00:02:21.330
the wealthier is the some under mark the

55
00:02:19.08 --> 00:02:24.239
welfare is the sum of all these people's

56
00:02:21.33 --> 00:02:27.090
work right but these people they only

57
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.519
get a share of the wealth per se create

58
00:02:27.09 --> 00:02:33.510
the rest is profit for the factories

59
00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.459
owners this means that if these people

60
00:02:33.51 --> 00:02:37.079
are working eight hours a day they're

61
00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.660
only getting a fraction of that maybe

62
00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.489
the first three or four hours work the

63
00:02:39.66 --> 00:02:46.530
other part the part of the businessman

64
00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:49.560
received is called surplus back the

65
00:02:46.53 --> 00:02:52.049
surplus value is therefore the exact

66
00:02:49.56 --> 00:02:53.970
expression of the expectation degree of

67
00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.910
the working force by the Capitol's or

68
00:02:53.97 --> 00:02:58.290
the worker by the capitalist so it's

69
00:02:56.91 --> 00:03:00.000
something you might be wondering how is

70
00:02:58.29 --> 00:03:02.730
it possible for the business owner to

71
00:03:00.0 --> 00:03:04.680
exploit the workers so easily why on the

72
00:03:02.73 --> 00:03:06.660
workers getting the whole value that

73
00:03:04.68 --> 00:03:08.160
they're generating the answer is because

74
00:03:06.66 --> 00:03:10.109
they don't have the tools required to

75
00:03:08.16 --> 00:03:11.850
take the raw materials and turn them

76
00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.040
into a finished product a factory a

77
00:03:11.85 --> 00:03:16.410
workshop whatever this is what in

78
00:03:14.04 --> 00:03:20.130
economic jargon is called the means of

79
00:03:16.41 --> 00:03:22.079
production or capital means in fact this

80
00:03:20.13 --> 00:03:24.930
is why the first new own of these things

81
00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.340
is often called a capitalist now despite

82
00:03:24.93 --> 00:03:28.950
what some people think mark has no

83
00:03:26.34 --> 00:03:31.349
problem if you want to own a fancy car

84
00:03:28.95 --> 00:03:33.150
or a really expensive mobile phone he

85
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.730
just has a problem if you want to own

86
00:03:33.15 --> 00:03:38.220
some means of production this means

87
00:03:35.73 --> 00:03:41.670
having a company but why is this a

88
00:03:38.22 --> 00:03:45.160
problem well let's take a look

89
00:03:41.67 --> 00:03:48.100
the contradictions of capitalism now

90
00:03:45.16 --> 00:03:50.260
must divide society into two classes on

91
00:03:48.1 --> 00:03:51.010
the one hand you have the capitalist the

92
00:03:50.26 --> 00:03:52.780
bourgeoisie

93
00:03:51.01 --> 00:03:55.150
and on the other hand you have the

94
00:03:52.78 --> 00:03:57.040
workers the proletariat the Borgia one

95
00:03:55.15 --> 00:04:00.220
of the own the production process and

96
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:01.540
they exploit the workers the workers are

97
00:04:00.22 --> 00:04:03.250
the ones who are doing the work and

98
00:04:01.54 --> 00:04:04.800
making the value but they only get the

99
00:04:03.25 --> 00:04:07.480
bread crumbs from the bourgeoisie

100
00:04:04.8 --> 00:04:09.310
therefore we have a confrontation or

101
00:04:07.48 --> 00:04:11.680
what you might have heard of a class

102
00:04:09.31 --> 00:04:14.050
struggle and this is what Marx defines

103
00:04:11.68 --> 00:04:15.910
as the original sin of the market

104
00:04:14.05 --> 00:04:17.739
economy and as you can clearly see it

105
00:04:15.91 --> 00:04:20.049
has nothing to do with poverty or

106
00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.580
inequality in fact in Nordic countries

107
00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.830
where the difference between the wealthy

108
00:04:21.58 --> 00:04:26.950
and the poor is not so great there is

109
00:04:23.83 --> 00:04:29.560
still capitalist exploitation as long as

110
00:04:26.95 --> 00:04:32.140
the means of production is in private

111
00:04:29.56 --> 00:04:34.270
hands this is why mark doesn't just

112
00:04:32.14 --> 00:04:38.770
focus his criticism with on capitalist

113
00:04:34.27 --> 00:04:41.290
but also in social democrats a second

114
00:04:38.77 --> 00:04:43.930
modality less systematic but yes more

115
00:04:41.29 --> 00:04:46.120
practical of socialism tries to freeze

116
00:04:43.93 --> 00:04:48.370
any revolutionary wheels from the

117
00:04:46.12 --> 00:04:50.320
working class claiming it is not a

118
00:04:48.37 --> 00:04:52.750
political reform that will give them

119
00:04:50.32 --> 00:04:54.850
benefit but only the modification of

120
00:04:52.75 --> 00:04:56.590
their material life conditions in

121
00:04:54.85 --> 00:04:59.050
summary the working relations of

122
00:04:56.59 --> 00:05:01.660
capitalism are based on one group living

123
00:04:59.05 --> 00:05:04.300
off another group this is what Marx

124
00:05:01.66 --> 00:05:05.890
calls the infrastructure of capitalism

125
00:05:04.3 --> 00:05:07.660
nevertheless in order to make this work

126
00:05:05.89 --> 00:05:10.390
the bourgeoisie needs some sort of

127
00:05:07.66 --> 00:05:12.190
secret weapon to keep that sanity that's

128
00:05:10.39 --> 00:05:15.220
why they create a government they create

129
00:05:12.19 --> 00:05:18.010
laws they create even religion this is

130
00:05:15.22 --> 00:05:20.590
what Marx calls the superstructure also

131
00:05:18.01 --> 00:05:22.510
known as a cultural hegemony so what is

132
00:05:20.59 --> 00:05:24.500
marked a solution to end all of this

133
00:05:22.51 --> 00:05:27.320
injustice

134
00:05:24.5 --> 00:05:28.910
the workers revolution further Marx

135
00:05:27.32 --> 00:05:34.130
believed that capitalism is

136
00:05:28.91 --> 00:05:35.990
unsustainable coming claim that their

137
00:05:34.13 --> 00:05:38.690
goals can be only achieved by the

138
00:05:35.99 --> 00:05:41.330
violent overthrow of every existing

139
00:05:38.69 --> 00:05:43.370
social order in fact he even predicts

140
00:05:41.33 --> 00:05:45.830
the first countries the fall will be the

141
00:05:43.37 --> 00:05:47.510
biggest industrial nations specifically

142
00:05:45.83 --> 00:05:49.400
he predicts the fall of the United

143
00:05:47.51 --> 00:05:54.170
Kingdom which was the leading industrial

144
00:05:49.4 --> 00:05:55.940
nation of his time what's the exporting

145
00:05:54.17 --> 00:05:59.240
their own destruction and their own

146
00:05:55.94 --> 00:06:02.270
Undertaker the proletariat but here is

147
00:05:59.24 --> 00:06:03.620
the most ironic part of the story if you

148
00:06:02.27 --> 00:06:05.930
look at all the facts the countries that

149
00:06:03.62 --> 00:06:07.700
have had Marxist revolutions are those

150
00:06:05.93 --> 00:06:10.130
that never had an industrial revolution

151
00:06:07.7 --> 00:06:12.020
and never had a bourgeoisie these were

152
00:06:10.13 --> 00:06:14.600
countries like Russia or China which

153
00:06:12.02 --> 00:06:16.490
never had a capitalist system at least a

154
00:06:14.6 --> 00:06:18.380
mark to find it those countries with

155
00:06:16.49 --> 00:06:20.450
advanced capitalism never even had a

156
00:06:18.38 --> 00:06:22.490
revolution maybe the only exceptions

157
00:06:20.45 --> 00:06:24.350
would be Hungary and Czechoslovakia but

158
00:06:22.49 --> 00:06:25.910
these were cases where communism didn't

159
00:06:24.35 --> 00:06:30.220
come through a revolution but by the

160
00:06:25.91 --> 00:06:30.220
USSR invading those countries

161
00:06:31.95 --> 00:06:35.760
in fact the key question the Marxist

162
00:06:33.9 --> 00:06:38.250
philosophers wondered during the 20th

163
00:06:35.76 --> 00:06:40.380
century is where is the revolution the

164
00:06:38.25 --> 00:06:42.150
Marx promised us this is a question that

165
00:06:40.38 --> 00:06:43.530
many people have trying to answer to

166
00:06:42.15 --> 00:06:45.960
philosophers that I would specifically

167
00:06:43.53 --> 00:06:48.360
recommend reading on this topic iuen

168
00:06:45.96 --> 00:06:50.340
Harbor math and then Tonio Gramsci they

169
00:06:48.36 --> 00:06:52.410
looks at human language as well as how

170
00:06:50.34 --> 00:06:53.640
humans perceive reality to see why we

171
00:06:52.41 --> 00:06:55.980
haven't had this revolution

172
00:06:53.64 --> 00:06:57.840
interestingly this research has even

173
00:06:55.98 --> 00:07:02.060
been useful in possibly the least

174
00:06:57.84 --> 00:07:02.060
Marxist thing you can imagine marketing

175
00:07:02.51 --> 00:07:05.940
because that is definitely something

176
00:07:04.47 --> 00:07:07.440
we're not going to address in this video

177
00:07:05.94 --> 00:07:09.090
but we'll save it for a future video but

178
00:07:07.44 --> 00:07:10.620
your interest in learning how Marx

179
00:07:09.09 --> 00:07:11.310
relates to marketing do let us know in

180
00:07:10.62 --> 00:07:13.110
the comments below

181
00:07:11.31 --> 00:07:15.510
if you are interested in finding out

182
00:07:13.11 --> 00:07:17.190
more about this topic now then you can

183
00:07:15.51 --> 00:07:19.530
check out a book written on the subject

184
00:07:17.19 --> 00:07:21.570
but unfortunately it's only in Spanish

185
00:07:19.53 --> 00:07:24.000
but it is written by one of the hosts of

186
00:07:21.57 --> 00:07:25.950
the Spanish visual politic channel señor

187
00:07:24.0 --> 00:07:27.570
Fonseca but as I said it's definitely

188
00:07:25.95 --> 00:07:32.520
something we'll consider addressing in a

189
00:07:27.57 --> 00:07:35.010
future video and now we have shared our

190
00:07:32.52 --> 00:07:36.690
opinion with you but what do you think

191
00:07:35.01 --> 00:07:38.430
of Marx's theories do you think that

192
00:07:36.69 --> 00:07:39.990
they're still relevant in the world we

193
00:07:38.43 --> 00:07:41.640
live in today and let us know in the

194
00:07:39.99 --> 00:07:44.070
comments below we'd love to read them

195
00:07:41.64 --> 00:07:45.990

00:07:54.96 --> 00:07:58.490
job and I'll see you next time
