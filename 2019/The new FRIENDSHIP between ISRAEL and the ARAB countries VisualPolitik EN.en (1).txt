31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,920
now I don't think it would be an

32
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,299
understatement to say that the State of

33
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:16,070
Israel has been in the spotlight since

34
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,439
it was founded in 1948 which all in

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,079
about 70 years of war with their Arab

36
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,149
neighbors seven decades of severe

37
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,710
tensions due to the Palestinian

38
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,459
situation seventy years of international

39
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:30,439
isolation only mitigated by the strong

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,509
support of the United States but hold on

41
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:43,750
a second because all of that is changing

42
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,700
in recent years Israel has gone from

43
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,770
being as vilified as Lindsay Lohan to

44
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,320
being as exalted as a Natalie Portman

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,330
and you might think I'm exaggerating but

46
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,760
have a look at what 2018 s number one

47
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,740
villain had to say about the country

48
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,470
Saudi prince says Israelis have right to

49
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,780
their own land the turnaround is so

50
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,280
dramatic that the Israeli national

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,950

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,220

the medal ceremony of an international

56
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,390

time ever in the United Arab Emirates

59
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,620
a woman you see crying emotionally is

60
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,060
the Israeli Minister of Culture and

61
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,980
sports Miri Regev the former Brigadier

62
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,840
General in the 2006 Lebanon War

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,370
certainly something of an about-face

64
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,230
isn't it this is especially true when we

65
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,420
take into account that to this day not

66
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,180
one country on the Arabian Peninsula

67
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,160
officially recognizes Israel as a state

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,980
but that's not the end of it around the

69
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,360
same time the Israeli prime minister

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,819
himself Benjamin Netanyahu made a secret

71
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,950
visit to the Sultan of Oman in the past

72
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,810
three months several Israeli ministers

73
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,000
have visited the Dubai Emirates and have

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,370
even met with Qatari representatives yep

75
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,040
we really did hear that correctly so how

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,140
on earth did Israel achieve such

77
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,510
diplomatic advances in such a short time

78
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,610
what are the Palestinians think of all

79
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,440
of this and perhaps the most important

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,840
question of all is an enduring peaceful

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,700
resolution finally in sight for this

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,920
region that has spent decades as the

planets powder-keg today on visual

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,100
politic we're gonna answer all of these

85
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,470
questions but first let's rewind for a

86
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,250
bit of history

87
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:40,520

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,440

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,120
may the 14th 1948 ben-gurion proclaims

91
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,890
the independence of the State of Israel

92
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,870
the very next day this brand-new nation

93
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,180
is invaded by the armies of five Arab

94
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,730
countries but why was that this rapid

95
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,849
and dramatic reaction well it turns out

96
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,890
that since the late 1800s Jews had been

97
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,930
buying up land in Palestine which at the

98
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,280
time was under the control of the

99
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,080
Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,569
anti-semitism it was running rife in

101
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,459
Europe so more and more Jewish people

102
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,440
were emigrating to the traditional land

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,479
of their ancestors after the first world

104
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,519
war however Palestine was put under a

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,229
mandate leaving the running of the

106
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,770
country and the hands of the UK and in

107
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,260
that solve the problem not exactly

108
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,490
if the British put forward policies

109
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,919
favoring the Jews the Arabs reacted with

110
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,289
riots and protests of all kinds them on

111
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,520
the other hands of the British favored

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
the Arab interests Jewish armed groups

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,160

20 years later World War one further

116
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,159
complicated the situation as you can

117
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,900
imagine the Jewish exodus to Palestine

118
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,430
only increased in the wake of the

119
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,080
horrors of the Holocaust what's more

120
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,699
it's highlighted the need for a

121
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,000
dedicated Jewish state

123
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,620
meanwhile in Palestine the situation

124
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,259
became increasingly unstable overwhelmed

125
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,270
by events the British authorities handed

126
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,280
control over to the United Nations and

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,229
that chain of events brought about one

128
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,270
of the most contentious resolutions in

129
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,580
the history of the United Nations and

130
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,500
that's resolution 181 with this

131
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,570
resolution the UN proposed dividing

132
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,789
Palestine into two separate states the

133
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,560
first of roughly 14,000 square

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,150
kilometers would be controlled by a

135
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,889
hebrew governments with a jewish

136
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,990
population of around 60% first the

137
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,180
remaining 40% would be Arab the second

138
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,340
slightly smaller state of around 11,000

139
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,840
kilometers would be controlled by the

140
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,490
Palestinian people with a Jewish

141
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,220
population of barely 2% at the same time

mandate the Jews accepted the resolution

145
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,810
the Arabs did not that's why the day

146
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,490
after the proclamation of Israel's

147
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,770
independence in 1948 the country was

148
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,440
invaded by Egypt Syria Lebanon Iraq and

149
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,630
Jordan and with that began a conflict

150
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,400
that's been dragged out for seven

and facing the armies of five countries

156

the clear Victor and this victory has

157
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,199
allowed Israel to expand its territory

158
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,330
considerably it was also the first

159
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,460
victory of the newly created Israel

160
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,169

161
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,089
one of the most powerful armies in the

162

only war between Israel and the Arab

165
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,589
called six-day war took place during

humiliating defeat for the Arab

171

Camp David agreements name are you

222
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,350

these agreements for Israel well

224
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,470
basically two things happens first

225
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,329
Jewish settlement began to emerge in the

226
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,430
West Bank and Gaza and this continues to

227
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,079
be a sticking point and one of the main

228
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,459
obstacles to peace between the

229
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,320
neighboring states secondly there was a

230
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,600
huge increase in violence and terrorist

231
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,820

this time both organizations they were

235
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,740
operating out of Lebanon which led to

236
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,510
Israeli military intervention in that

237
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,790
country on two separate occasions the

238
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,110
arab-israeli conflicts it didn't let up

239
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,459
despite the conflicts Jordan also

240
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,829
recognized the Jewish state in the 1990s

241
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,480
this was during the time of the Madrid

242
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,850
and Oslo negotiations where progress was

243
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,800
made towards Palestinian self-government

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,820
up until that point

245
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,529
Palestine's power to make an implement

246
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,570
its own policies had been very limited

247
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,579
in practice that may explain the years

248
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:41,709

258

the Middle East is experiencing its own

259
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,250
version the Cold War the clash between

260
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,079
Riyadh and Tehran has reached an

261
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,060
unprecedented level this cold war has

262
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,550
intensified since the end of 2017 when

263
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,320
Saudi Arabia the Arab Emirates Bahrain

264
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,720
and Egypt imposed an almost total

265
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,850
economic blockade on Qatar because of

266
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,100
its relations with Iran and also for its

267
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,839
support of the Muslim brothers by the

268
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,310
way this group is also very closely

269
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,769
linked with Hamas in Palestine Hamas in

270
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:35,810
turn maintains very close relations with

271
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,320
Qatar Hamas pays Gaza clerks

272
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,449
after receiving fifteen million dollars

273
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,399
from Qatar but nowadays in the Middle

274
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,740
East having good relations with Qatar it

275
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,709
will cost you dearly

276
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,410
Egypt court sentences mercy to 25 years

277
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,050
in Qatar spy case all right so no

278
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,670
seconds Egypt Qatar you're probably

279
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,649
thinking right now Simon what on earth

280
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,690
does any of this have to do with Israel

281
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,149
this makes no sense well the fact is

282
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,459
that this Arab cold war provides Israel

283
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,740
with a rather unique opportunity so

284
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,620
let's break it down

285
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,420
[Music]

286
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,330
Israel is a declared enemy of Iran and

287
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,850
vice-versa for Jerusalem the ayatollahs

288
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,740
government is their archenemy and now

289
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,660
you've got the old saying my enemy's

290
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,340
enemy is my friend

291
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,440
so that means suddenly Israel has become

292
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,050
a potential ally for Riyadh and a very

293
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,090
important ally indeed

294
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,270
[Music]

295
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,880
and there's more here the Arab countries

296
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,040
have want Washington support at all

297
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,290
costs and so here's a question what

298
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,940
would please the White House more than

299
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,680
Arab nations becoming close to the

300
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,060
Jewish state I mean it's just a

301
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,130
no-brainer for them and if we add to all

302
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,020
of that the fact that many Arab capitals

303
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,730
are getting tired of Palestine and if

304
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,920
Hamas is ties with Qatar and this looks

305
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,540
like a done deal that's why when

306
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,920
Australia suddenly announced that it

307
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,779
recognized Jerusalem as the Israeli

308
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,660
capital we saw reactions like this

309
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,240
Bahrain FM defends Australia's decision

310
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,060
on Jerusalem but I don't think that this

311
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,430
is just about geopolitics on this

312
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,649
occasion money is also playing a key

313
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:26,439
role so let's take a look at that

314
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,429
business as usual we've mentioned this

315
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,079
in several videos over the last two

316
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,350
decades Israel's economy has skyrocketed

[Music]

318
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,339
the country has become a world leader in

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,500
technological innovation and now to top

320
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,060
it all off it has discovered huge

321
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,490
deposits of natural gas off its coast so

322
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,899
now we're beginning to see headlines

323
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,260
like this Egyptian firm to buy fifteen

324
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,360
billion dollars of his really natural

325
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,670
gas yeah we're talking about the most

326
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,529
significant economic agreements ever

327
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:02,550
achieved - between these two countries

328
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,500
but Israel's economic ties with the Arab

329
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,899
world they go much further than that you

330
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,370
see while the Gulf countries may not

331
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,560
officially recognize the Israeli state

332
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,660
they do recognize their technological

333
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,880
superiority especially in the areas of

334
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,830
defense and security and this has

335
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,990
far-reaching consequences in the midst

336
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,149
of the Arab cold war Israeli technology

337
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,670
has become highly prized indeed so much

338
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,870
so that there are strong indications

339
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,880
that Israel is already supplying

340
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,529
technological equipment to Saudi Arabia

341
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:34,720
while the Saudi secret services are

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,430
sharing information with the Israeli

343
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,810
intelligence agency Mossad relations

344
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,640
indeed seem to be so good that according

345
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,500
to US sources Saudi Arabia may have

346
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,029
bought part of the Israeli missile

347
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:47,800
defense system technology known as the

348
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,080
Iron Dome now to be fair Israel has

349
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,029
denied this but you know in this type of

350
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,560
business discretion certainly rules

351
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,000
there is an alignment of Israel and

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,620
other countries in the Middle East that

353
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,600
would have been unimaginable ten years

354
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,150
ago certainly in my lifetime I never saw

355
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,459
anything like it and I'm the same age as

356
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:08,529
the State of Israel more or less so it's

357
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,270
an extraordinary thing Benjamin

these days visits from the highest

361
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,360
Israeli authorities to many Arab

362
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,890
countries are turning into a common

363
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,390
event significant trade agreements that

364
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,340
being signed and security and defense

365
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,560
ties are at unprecedented levels

366
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,790
so essentially Arab and Israeli

367
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,100
relations seem to be getting better and

368
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,780
better with plenty of nods and winks

369
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,210
between the main players one example of

370
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,410
this would be the Saudi government's

371
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,270
decision to allow commercial flights to

372
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,250
Israel to cross Saudi airspace for the

373
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,470
first time in 70 years of course though

374
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,390
all of this has a downside dealing with

00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,340
democratic countries is not the same as

376
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,780
dealing with dictatorships that

377
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,580
sometimes seem to be stuck in the Middle

378
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,340
Ages you may get nasty surprises like

379
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,190
this one is really software helped

380
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,680
Saudis spy on Khashoggi lawsuit says

381
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,750
anyway that's how things stand today

382
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,460
everything points the likelihood that

383
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,470
the arab-israeli conflict could soon

384
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,030
become a thing of the past

385
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,800
the only remaining question is will we

386
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
see a solution to that core Palestinian

387
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,540
problem so I really hope you enjoyed
