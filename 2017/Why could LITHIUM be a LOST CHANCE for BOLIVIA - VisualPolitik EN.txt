3
00:00:06.74 --> 00:00:12.809
Olivia and chilli are the 50 cent and

4
00:00:09.99 --> 00:00:14.519
kanye west's of latin america now it is

5
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.990
true they share a border but other than

6
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.210
laughter they couldn't be more different

7
00:00:15.99 --> 00:00:20.099
olivia is one of the poorest countries

8
00:00:18.21 --> 00:00:21.899
on the whole continents while Chile is

9
00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.749
among the wealthiest Bolivia is a

10
00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:26.309
paragon of the so called indigenous

11
00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.979
socialism while Chile is known as the

12
00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.630
mordoor of neoliberalism and as if this

13
00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.629
was not enough the two countries are

14
00:00:30.63 --> 00:00:34.739
involved in seemingly never-ending

15
00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.079
territorial disputes with each other

16
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
nonetheless now there is one thing that

17
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.640
these two countries have in common

18
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.699
yes if you are we are talking about

19
00:00:41.64 --> 00:00:52.440
white gold damn damn

20
00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.899
no no no no that type of white gold I'm

21
00:00:52.44 --> 00:00:56.519
talking here about lithium lithium is

22
00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.679
use for the manufacturing of battery

23
00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.079
that's power your cell phone your laptop

24
00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.359
and those electric cars Berg eventually

25
00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.350
might flood our roads and highways the

26
00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.210
cotton new oil

27
00:01:04.35 --> 00:01:09.000
it's the latest metal on the periodic

28
00:01:06.21 --> 00:01:10.740
table its value has gone up tenfold in

29
00:01:09.0 --> 00:01:14.180
the last two decades alone and its

30
00:01:10.74 --> 00:01:14.180
demand won't stop growing

31
00:01:14.74 --> 00:01:19.820
between 60 and 80% of the world's known

32
00:01:17.9 --> 00:01:22.190
reserves are in an area called the

33
00:01:19.82 --> 00:01:24.470
lithium triangle this is an area that

34
00:01:22.19 --> 00:01:26.600
covers parts of Argentina Bolivia and

35
00:01:24.47 --> 00:01:28.640
Chile in these countries lithium is

36
00:01:26.6 --> 00:01:30.830
abundant and easy to extract in other

37
00:01:28.64 --> 00:01:33.229
words this part of the planet might soon

38
00:01:30.83 --> 00:01:34.970
become a new Saudi Arabia the form that

39
00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.750
it's found in is found in like these

40
00:01:34.97 --> 00:01:40.580
dried-up salt lakes solarz so or brines

41
00:01:38.75 --> 00:01:42.290
which is very different than getting

42
00:01:40.58 --> 00:01:44.450
lithium out of hard rock it's much

43
00:01:42.29 --> 00:01:46.850
cheaper much more effective among those

44
00:01:44.45 --> 00:01:49.340
three countries Bolivia is the luckiest

45
00:01:46.85 --> 00:01:51.170
one the so called salar de uyuni holds

46
00:01:49.34 --> 00:01:53.270
two or three times more lithium reserves

47
00:01:51.17 --> 00:01:55.220
than the mines in argentina or in chile

48
00:01:53.27 --> 00:01:57.619
now on the other hand chile already has

49
00:01:55.22 --> 00:01:59.360
a world-class mining industry however

50
00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.220
despite these reserves bolivia is

51
00:01:59.36 --> 00:02:03.140
exporting less lithium than the other

52
00:02:01.22 --> 00:02:05.390
two countries and Chile might actually

53
00:02:03.14 --> 00:02:07.399
soon be out of this new white gold rush

54
00:02:05.39 --> 00:02:08.720
in fact Argentina is the nation that is

55
00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.700
getting the most attention from

56
00:02:08.72 --> 00:02:13.130
international investors so today's

57
00:02:10.7 --> 00:02:15.530
question has to be what's going on in

58
00:02:13.13 --> 00:02:17.810
Bolivia why is no one exploiting their

59
00:02:15.53 --> 00:02:19.760
lithium resources and why is Chile

60
00:02:17.81 --> 00:02:21.410
following suit today we're going to

61
00:02:19.76 --> 00:02:25.360
answer all of those questions but before

62
00:02:21.41 --> 00:02:28.280
we do let's take a look at the history a

63
00:02:25.36 --> 00:02:29.930
new potosi now if you've been subscribed

64
00:02:28.28 --> 00:02:31.340
to visual politic for a while you

65
00:02:29.93 --> 00:02:33.470
already know that having natural

66
00:02:31.34 --> 00:02:36.970
resources doesn't mean that you are rich

67
00:02:33.47 --> 00:02:39.660
Bolivia is an excellent example of this

68
00:02:36.97 --> 00:02:41.820
[Music]

69
00:02:39.66 --> 00:02:44.400
the country has all the natural wealth

70
00:02:41.82 --> 00:02:46.590
you can imagine lithium silver natural

71
00:02:44.4 --> 00:02:48.690
gas nevertheless it is still one of the

72
00:02:46.59 --> 00:02:51.390
poorest countries in all of South

73
00:02:48.69 --> 00:02:53.130
America the silver mines of potosi were

74
00:02:51.39 --> 00:02:58.260
the site of war for the Spanish crown

75
00:02:53.13 --> 00:03:00.900
during the 16th and 17th centuries in

76
00:02:58.26 --> 00:03:02.730
fact Spaniards still say this is worth a

77
00:03:00.9 --> 00:03:04.440
potosi meaning that something is too

78
00:03:02.73 --> 00:03:06.600
expensive but the native Bolivians

79
00:03:04.44 --> 00:03:08.460
didn't reap the benefits of that silver

80
00:03:06.6 --> 00:03:10.320
wealth and millions died under the

81
00:03:08.46 --> 00:03:12.030
extreme working conditions in the mines

82
00:03:10.32 --> 00:03:14.610
this is why it's pretty understandable

83
00:03:12.03 --> 00:03:16.320
that the government of Evo Morales is so

84
00:03:14.61 --> 00:03:18.420
reluctant to in our foreign companies to

85
00:03:16.32 --> 00:03:20.840
get into the country and extract the

86
00:03:18.42 --> 00:03:20.840
lithium

87
00:03:21.74 --> 00:03:26.120
besides let's be honest the real

88
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:27.860
business here is not the raw materials

89
00:03:26.12 --> 00:03:29.780
but in the industry that comes

90
00:03:27.86 --> 00:03:31.550
afterwards for a better understanding of

91
00:03:29.78 --> 00:03:34.250
this while we make this video a metric

92
00:03:31.55 --> 00:03:36.440
tonne of lithium costs around $9,000 on

93
00:03:34.25 --> 00:03:38.240
the international market but if we take

94
00:03:36.44 --> 00:03:40.430
that raw lithium and we turn it into

95
00:03:38.24 --> 00:03:42.470
batteries for mobile phones we can turn

96
00:03:40.43 --> 00:03:45.890
that lithium into a value of somewhere

97
00:03:42.47 --> 00:03:47.480
between 1.5 and 5 million dollars of

98
00:03:45.89 --> 00:03:49.070
course this is just a rough estimated

99
00:03:47.48 --> 00:03:50.750
value and there are a lot of things that

100
00:03:49.07 --> 00:03:52.670
should be considered here but it can

101
00:03:50.75 --> 00:03:54.890
help to look at a comparison indeed it

102
00:03:52.67 --> 00:03:57.080
can help explain news like this a

103
00:03:54.89 --> 00:03:59.990
Brazilian state Abel Morales keynote at

104
00:03:57.08 --> 00:04:02.270
Evo Morales opened in 2013 the first

105
00:03:59.99 --> 00:04:05.300
plant of lithium carbonate and in

106
00:04:02.27 --> 00:04:08.090
February 2014 the first manufacturing

107
00:04:05.3 --> 00:04:10.580
facility for lithium-ion batteries but

108
00:04:08.09 --> 00:04:12.650
that is not all in Bolivia lithium is

109
00:04:10.58 --> 00:04:14.360
nationalized this means that if you are

110
00:04:12.65 --> 00:04:15.650
a private mining company and you want to

111
00:04:14.36 --> 00:04:17.300
work on Bolivian soil

112
00:04:15.65 --> 00:04:19.250
you must partner with the government and

113
00:04:17.3 --> 00:04:21.170
start a new company which will be owned

114
00:04:19.25 --> 00:04:22.790
partly by the government this new

115
00:04:21.17 --> 00:04:24.410
company can get paid for their service

116
00:04:22.79 --> 00:04:26.330
and building the mines setting up the

117
00:04:24.41 --> 00:04:29.150
machinery and extracting the lithium

118
00:04:26.33 --> 00:04:31.130
Marta the lithium they extract well that

119
00:04:29.15 --> 00:04:32.330
belongs to the government they have no

120
00:04:31.13 --> 00:04:34.559
rights to sell

121
00:04:32.33 --> 00:04:36.719
[Music]

122
00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:39.029
so now you might be wondering why does

123
00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.429
Olivia need foreign companies to exploit

124
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:44.449
their own wealth can't they simply do it

125
00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:47.039
themselves well the short answer is no

126
00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.149
modern-day mining it has nothing to do

127
00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.979
with the image you probably have in your

128
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:52.649
mind of it going with a hard hat and a

129
00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.079
pickaxe today mining requires high-end

130
00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:57.119
machinery and world-class engineers as

131
00:04:55.079 --> 00:05:02.069
you can imagine these things are scarce

132
00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:03.209
in the country as poor as the Libya if

133
00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.219
you wanted to create a competitive

134
00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:08.399
mining industry in that country without

135
00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:10.619
outside help you would need decades this

136
00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:12.719
is why it is so important to utilize

137
00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:15.179
companies who have the technology the

138
00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:17.099
tools and the staff to do the job and

139
00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:19.409
this is why even Morales himself

140
00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.629
unfriendly to multinationals have said

141
00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.939
that it's time to get out there and find

142
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.829
investors in the little containers as

143
00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.079
soon as we have a big lithium industry

144
00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.869
Olivia will set the lithium price for

145
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:32.429
the whole world down general athelas I

146
00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:34.829
want to say to you

147
00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:36.140
governments and private companies now

148
00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:41.960
you can join us

149
00:05:36.14 --> 00:05:44.000
[Music]

150
00:05:41.96 --> 00:05:45.260
so all right so what exactly is the

151
00:05:44.0 --> 00:05:48.080
problem here well as I said before

152
00:05:45.26 --> 00:05:49.310
Bolivian lithium is owned by the state

153
00:05:48.08 --> 00:05:50.840
this means that companies that might

154
00:05:49.31 --> 00:05:52.340
invest in the country can only get a

155
00:05:50.84 --> 00:05:54.950
profit by partnering with the government

156
00:05:52.34 --> 00:05:58.180
and from that profit they must pay a

157
00:05:54.95 --> 00:06:01.160
special mining tax that goes up to 37.5%

158
00:05:58.18 --> 00:06:02.960
which is by far the largest in the

159
00:06:01.16 --> 00:06:04.670
region and if all of this wasn't enough

160
00:06:02.96 --> 00:06:06.680
well according to the World Bank Bolivia

161
00:06:04.67 --> 00:06:08.870
ranks among the 50 countries where it is

162
00:06:06.68 --> 00:06:11.540
hardest to do business they rank at

163
00:06:08.87 --> 00:06:13.250
about the same level as Sierra Leone

164
00:06:11.54 --> 00:06:15.230
so now let's say that you're someone who

165
00:06:13.25 --> 00:06:17.300
wants to invest in lithium things can't

166
00:06:15.23 --> 00:06:18.890
be investing in Bolivia or maybe you

167
00:06:17.3 --> 00:06:22.250
might prefer one of those other

168
00:06:18.89 --> 00:06:24.470
countries you know maybe this explains

169
00:06:22.25 --> 00:06:26.120
why at the moment Bolivia while it is

170
00:06:24.47 --> 00:06:28.220
the country with the biggest lithium

171
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:30.230
resources it is also the country that is

172
00:06:28.22 --> 00:06:32.300
exploiting them the least if you pay

173
00:06:30.23 --> 00:06:34.700
attention to the chart here you will see

174
00:06:32.3 --> 00:06:36.350
that today the leader of the lithium

175
00:06:34.7 --> 00:06:39.370
race is Australia

176
00:06:36.35 --> 00:06:41.410
[Music]

177
00:06:39.37 --> 00:06:43.419
this is surprising because the resources

178
00:06:41.41 --> 00:06:45.639
of this country are four times smaller

179
00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.620
than those of Bolivia South Australian

180
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.380
salaries are six times higher than

181
00:06:47.62 --> 00:06:52.750
Bolivian ones so as you can see this is

182
00:06:50.38 --> 00:06:56.020
not a matter of low paid jobs or natural

183
00:06:52.75 --> 00:06:58.090
wealth but simply good and bad economic

184
00:06:56.02 --> 00:07:00.610
policies but hold on just a minute

185
00:06:58.09 --> 00:07:02.530
because this is not the only problem so

186
00:07:00.61 --> 00:07:04.990
forget that Evo Morales dream is for

187
00:07:02.53 --> 00:07:08.229
Bolivia to become a manufacturing leader

188
00:07:04.99 --> 00:07:09.910
in the lithium battery industry but how

189
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.860
exactly is he going to achieve this

190
00:07:09.91 --> 00:07:14.810
without foreign companies setting up

191
00:07:11.86 --> 00:07:16.620
inside the country

192
00:07:14.81 --> 00:07:19.050
[Music]

193
00:07:16.62 --> 00:07:20.790
all right so yeah the government can set

194
00:07:19.05 --> 00:07:23.040
up its own factory and that's all great

195
00:07:20.79 --> 00:07:24.780
and everything but technology patterns

196
00:07:23.04 --> 00:07:26.820
and the skills needed they're held by

197
00:07:24.78 --> 00:07:29.370
companies like Panasonic Samsung or

198
00:07:26.82 --> 00:07:31.860
Tesla without these Olivia would need

199
00:07:29.37 --> 00:07:33.930
decades of research in order to be

200
00:07:31.86 --> 00:07:35.760
competitive on the international market

201
00:07:33.93 --> 00:07:37.500
all right so a while ago we mentioned

202
00:07:35.76 --> 00:07:44.070
Chile now let's go and have a look at

203
00:07:37.5 --> 00:07:46.590
what's happening over there they follows

204
00:07:44.07 --> 00:07:48.330
in the steps of Bolivia for years Chile

205
00:07:46.59 --> 00:07:50.700
has been known as something of a

206
00:07:48.33 --> 00:07:52.620
free-market Disneyland well precisely

207
00:07:50.7 --> 00:07:55.200
their mining industry was one of the

208
00:07:52.62 --> 00:07:56.580
freest in the entire world we're talking

209
00:07:55.2 --> 00:07:58.650
about the country whether your colony

210
00:07:56.58 --> 00:08:00.510
relies heavily on copper mining this is

211
00:07:58.65 --> 00:08:02.760
why in the year 1981 Pinochet

212
00:08:00.51 --> 00:08:07.110
dictatorship passed the so-called

213
00:08:02.76 --> 00:08:10.800
mining law this allowed private

214
00:08:07.11 --> 00:08:12.330
businesses to own 100% of a mind as you

215
00:08:10.8 --> 00:08:13.680
can imagine this law kick-started

216
00:08:12.33 --> 00:08:15.780
foreign investment in the country

217
00:08:13.68 --> 00:08:17.910
suddenly lots of companies like the

218
00:08:15.78 --> 00:08:21.180
Australian bhp Billington or the Swiss

219
00:08:17.91 --> 00:08:22.380
Xstrata came to Chile and yeah listen I

220
00:08:21.18 --> 00:08:23.970
know you're thinking all these

221
00:08:22.38 --> 00:08:25.830
multinational companies well they looted

222
00:08:23.97 --> 00:08:29.070
the country and left it in poverty right

223
00:08:25.83 --> 00:08:30.990
right well actually that's totally wrong

224
00:08:29.07 --> 00:08:33.120
of course these Canadian Swiss and

225
00:08:30.99 --> 00:08:35.300
Australian companies came to extract the

226
00:08:33.12 --> 00:08:35.300
copper

227
00:08:36.28 --> 00:08:41.180
but they also help to finance lots of

228
00:08:39.14 --> 00:08:42.680
brand-new companies which employ Chilean

229
00:08:41.18 --> 00:08:45.140
workers and we're headquartered in

230
00:08:42.68 --> 00:08:47.990
Santiago companies like manera as can be

231
00:08:45.14 --> 00:08:50.030
de or Antofagasta mining in fact thanks

232
00:08:47.99 --> 00:08:52.730
to this wave of investors Chile now has

233
00:08:50.03 --> 00:08:54.260
a world-class mining industry actually

234
00:08:52.73 --> 00:08:56.690
many of the engineers that are now

235
00:08:54.26 --> 00:08:59.060
needed in Bolivia bathe live in the best

236
00:08:56.69 --> 00:09:01.340
neighborhood to Santiago and this means

237
00:08:59.06 --> 00:09:04.250
that Chile has been in a great position

238
00:09:01.34 --> 00:09:06.740
to lead this white Gold Rush nonetheless

239
00:09:04.25 --> 00:09:09.320
in 2016 Chilean President Michelle

240
00:09:06.74 --> 00:09:14.660
Bachelet declared that Elysium was a

241
00:09:09.32 --> 00:09:16.670
different animal firm the strategic

242
00:09:14.66 --> 00:09:19.040
condition of lithium which is property

243
00:09:16.67 --> 00:09:22.100
of all Chilean people and will keep its

244
00:09:19.04 --> 00:09:23.540
state as non-concessional material in

245
00:09:22.1 --> 00:09:26.270
other words the government of Chile is

246
00:09:23.54 --> 00:09:28.040
following suit with Bolivia bar so they

247
00:09:26.27 --> 00:09:29.930
do have an important difference in this

248
00:09:28.04 --> 00:09:32.300
case the country already has the

249
00:09:29.93 --> 00:09:34.400
technology and the staff to exploit its

250
00:09:32.3 --> 00:09:36.590
mineral wealth in an efficient way of

251
00:09:34.4 --> 00:09:38.150
course many of these companies who were

252
00:09:36.59 --> 00:09:40.700
willing to invest in the country have

253
00:09:38.15 --> 00:09:42.590
lost all interest but Chile has its own

254
00:09:40.7 --> 00:09:44.960
companies so it's not so big a deal

255
00:09:42.59 --> 00:09:47.060
besides until 2014 the other countries

256
00:09:44.96 --> 00:09:49.400
of this lithium triangle Argentina and

257
00:09:47.06 --> 00:09:54.410
Bolivia well way worse places for

258
00:09:49.4 --> 00:09:55.730
investment so in this case is sort of

259
00:09:54.41 --> 00:09:58.580
like in the land of the blind the

260
00:09:55.73 --> 00:10:01.220
one-eyed person is king well they until

261
00:09:58.58 --> 00:10:02.960
now Argentina has been the big surprise

262
00:10:01.22 --> 00:10:04.880
here while Chile and Bolivia have

263
00:10:02.96 --> 00:10:07.190
nationalized the lithium and have tried

264
00:10:04.88 --> 00:10:10.130
badly to scare away foreign companies

265
00:10:07.19 --> 00:10:11.690
Argentina with Mauricio Macri as its

266
00:10:10.13 --> 00:10:13.550
president is doing something rather

267
00:10:11.69 --> 00:10:15.170
different and they're now getting all

268
00:10:13.55 --> 00:10:15.850
the attention from international

269
00:10:15.17 --> 00:10:16.540
investors

270
00:10:15.85 --> 00:10:18.129

272
00:10:18.129 --> 00:10:22.009
but we're actually going to talk about

273
00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:23.989
that in upcoming weeks in a sort of

274
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:25.489
second part of this video so if you

275
00:10:23.989 --> 00:10:27.709
don't want to miss that please do be

sure to subscribe to this channel in the

277
00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:31.910
meantime we've got a question for you do

278
00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:34.069
you think that Bolivia and Chile can

279
00:10:31.91 --> 00:10:35.779
reap the benefits of their lithium with

280
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:38.029
these kinds of policies or maybe

281
00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.139
Argentina will somehow overshadow them

282
00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:41.689
you can leave me an answer in the

283
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:43.009
comment section below and just before we

284
00:10:41.689 --> 00:10:44.689
go today I've got a really important

285
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:46.129
question and sort of a request from you

286
00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:48.319
you might have notice that we'd rather

287
00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:49.670
like using rock music in our videos and

288
00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:51.350
we'd love to hear from anyone who has a

289
00:10:49.67 --> 00:10:52.970
band and thinks that their music could

290
00:10:51.35 --> 00:10:54.889
be a good fit for us well of course

291
00:10:52.97 --> 00:10:57.259
gives you full credit in the video if we

292
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:58.399
do use your music if you're interested

293
00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:00.079
in doing that please drop us an email

294
00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:02.239
you can do that that info app visual

295
00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:04.009
politics on net also please don't forget

296
00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:05.480
to visit our friends at being Rican to

297
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:07.069
the media podcasts they provided the

298
00:11:05.48 --> 00:11:08.929
vocals in those episodes that are not

299
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:11.089
mine and if you liked this video give it
