3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,260
there are two countries in the world

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,179
that are often held up as examples of

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,910
what not to do two countries that for a

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,770
long time seemed able to conquer the

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,210
world but which have been undergoing

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,029
chronic crises for decades crises from

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,859
which they seem to not be able to escape

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,000
in which countries I'm talking about one

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
is Argentina that's easy the other is

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,930
18,000 kilometers away and is none other

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,399
than Japan of course this doesn't mean

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,989
that these two countries are the same

15
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,670
not at all the fact is that whenever a

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,350
developed country has problems Japan

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,750
always appears as an example of what not

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,460
to do

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,530

europe's remedies for japanese ation

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,310
weak growth and slowing inflation could

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,410
have europeans afraid of repeating

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,989
japan's mistakes crabs folks the person

25
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,370
who experienced the most negative

26
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,990
aspects of japan's decline in recent

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,970
decades was emperor akihito

28
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,920
who abdicated the throne on April the

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,750

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,009
allow me to explain Japan's emperor has

33
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,380
no real power and a ketose reign was a

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,880
particularly unlucky one when he came to

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,280
the throne in 1989 Japan seemed ready to

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,229
take on the world

37
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,030
that same year Japanese company Sony got

38
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,009
a major foothold in Hollywood by buying

39
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,810
Columbia Pictures Mitsubishi's real

40
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,340
estate division got the Rockefeller

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,080
Center itself Japanese companies were

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,030
investing everywhere and all four castes

43
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,470
indicated that the Japanese economy

44
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,600
would surpass even the US economy within

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,649
a few years however in just three years

46
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,420
everything fell apart

47
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,920
the Japanese model exploded and the

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,840
tokyo stock market collapsed and the

49
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,369
crisis spread throughout the japanese

50
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,049
financial system the years of strong

51
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,709
economic growth they had ended forever

52
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,599
since 1991 the average economic growth

53
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,090
has been only 0.9 percent a year

54
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,010
public debt has increased from fifty to

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,780
two hundred and thirty six percent of

56
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,340
the GDP it was China that snatched

57
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,319
second place and the largest economies

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,940
in the world Japanese companies lost

59
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,010
grounds and Japan was left out at the

60
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,540
top positions in the great internet

61
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,599
revolution

62
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,579
the cost of this decline strenuous

63
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,530
working hours of 12 hours a Morris store

64
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,329
common Japanese workers barely enjoyed

65
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,280
ten days of vacation a year and wages

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,590
are even lower than three decades ago in

67
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,540
real terms and that's not all the last

68
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,519
three decades haven't only been bad from

69
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,019
an economic point of view they have also

70
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,430
been very rocky in political terms Japan

71
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,200
has had 17 prime ministers from five

72
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,609
different political parties in the last

73
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:56,769
thirty years which is pretty insane and

74
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:58,659
as if this wasn't enough during Akihito

75
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,000
years the birthrate has been low which

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,680
has resulted in an aging population the

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,480
country has faced disasters such as the

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,219
tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear

79
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,129
accidents of 2011 not to mention the

80
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,430
North Korean threat

81
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,750
now you might understand why they say

82
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,150
that Emperor Akihito had bad luck but

83
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,040
hold on a second when we think of Japan

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,470
it's not just a crisis we think about as

85
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,900
manga sushi car brands like Toyotas so

86
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:31,480
well are things really that bad in Japan

87
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,160
what if I told you that things haven't

88
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,780
been as negative as they seem

89
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,030
what if Japan were somehow starting to

90
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,830
shine once again in this video we've

91
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,780
decided to look at someone Japan's best

92
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,160
features we're also gonna look at a

93
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,660
social revolution that is stealthily

94
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,580
taking place that could set a benchmark

95
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,800
or at least provide an experiments for

96
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,120
the rest of the world so listen up

98
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:03,430
the best side van has been having a bad

99
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,440
time for three decades it's been stuck

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,390
in a kind of stagnation that it cannot

101
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,490
overcome yet despite this their numbers

102
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,120
are still pretty good

[Music]

104
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,530
obviously it won't surprise you when I

105
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,030
say that Japan is still a very wealthy

106
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,859
country we all know that but the

107
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,990
question is how rich or rather how

108
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,479
prosperous is the country of the Rising

109
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:33,100
Sun well folks we could say the Japan is

110
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,750
still one of the top 20 countries in the

111
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,400
world where households have the most

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,710
income after taxes with twenty eight

113
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,229
thousand six hundred and forty-one US

114
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:43,210
dollars Japan is at the level of

115
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,370
countries such as Denmark Finland or the

116
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,990
Netherlands and is above the United

117
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,390

119
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,800
it's also one of the five or six

120
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
countries where on average families have

121
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,460
the most financial assets once their

122
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,790
debts have been deducted

124
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,710
it also has one of the highest life

educational levels in the Pisa index

128
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,390
Japan is just behind Singapore in R&D

129
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,310
research and developments more than 150

130
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,170
billion u.s. dollars are invested every

131
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,520
year ranking them the third highest

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,140
country in terms of levels of spending

133
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,910
and the fifth highest when you compare

134
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,770
the amount spent to their GDP Japan

135
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,690
comes interest below South Korea Israel

136
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,280
Sweden and Taiwan and folks even though

137
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,930
they have the highest public debt in the

138
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,190
world no less than two hundred and

139
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,870
thirty seven percent of the GDP it

140
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,660
really isn't as serious as it seems

141
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,080
[Music]

142
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,610
the Japanese government has several

143
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,139
debts yes but it also has a lot of

144
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,759
financial assets and if you take these

145
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,800
into account its net debt is decreased

146
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
to only approximately a hundred and

147
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,340
fifty percent you should never only

148
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,650
count what you oh but also count what

149
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,730
you have

150
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,599
[Music]

151
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,309
and that's not all the government's main

152
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,349
creditor is the central bank which in a

153
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,179
way means that the entire debt has

154
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,649
already been shared among the Japanese

155
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,599
for the last three decades for example

156
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,009
with a lower financial return with a

157
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,330
good part of the capital going into

158
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,649
public hands due to the central bank

159
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,990
purchases of assets and with less real

160
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,270
wages in any case the entire debt is in

161
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,800
the hands of the Japanese so to speak

162
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,080
Japan has no external debt it isn't a

163
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,110
debtor in fact it's quite the opposite

164
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,539
Japan China and Germany world's top

165
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,240
creditors Japan kept its position as the

166
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,159
world's largest creditor nation for the

167
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,529
twenty second straight year last year

168
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,149
and unlike other countries their

169
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,919
companies aren't linked to the debt

170
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,270
either look no further the Tokyo stock

171
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,069
markets the fourth largest stock market

172
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,839
in the world where 60% of the companies

173
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,979
have no net debt seen this way in spite

174
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,569
of all of the country's problems because

175
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,729
they do have them things don't look so

176
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,060
bad do they

177
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,220
and what's more in recent years between

178
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,250
2007 and 2017 a curious development has

179
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,050
taken place you see the Japanese economy

180
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,510
is barely growing that's a fact but its

181
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,040
population is shrinking in this economy

182
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,169
has no inflation the real growth per

183
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,700
capita which ultimately determines the

184
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,590
level of well-being has risen to equal

185
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,600
the growth rate of the US and is ranked

186
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,130
above countries such as France and the

187
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,440
UK surprised well you shouldn't be

188
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,419
this has been largely driven by the

189
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,940
Asian continents economic explosion

190
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,560
afterall Japan has neighbors such as

191
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,240
China Vietnam and India where for

192
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,130
example Suzuki a Japanese car company

193
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,910
accounts for just over 50% of the entire

194
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,870
Indian car market we're talking about

195
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,610
billions of potential customers here

196
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,050
want another example well look at what

197
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,460
happens with tourism you see

198
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,020
traditionally japan has had very few

199
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,880
tourists mainly because of its distance

200
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,440
from other developed countries however

201
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,540
in recent years it's become quite the

202
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,200
theme-park

203
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Japan has the largest growing tourist

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,070
rival rate in the world within a short

205
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,570
time that's largely thanks to Chinese

206
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,160
visitors the number of foreign tourists

207
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,020
has gone from just over 6 million in

208
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,680
2011 to over 31 million in 2018 and

209
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,060
forecasts say that this figure could

210
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,230
exceed 60 million by 2030

211
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,660
obviously all of this means a lot of new

212
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,450
jobs but its population is the oldest in

213
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,460
the world's and is in fact reducing

214
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,920
every year so how can they fill all of

215
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,810
these new positions role folks that's

216
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,610
where the sexual revolution promoted by

217
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,410
the prime minister shinzo our day comes

218
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,360
into play and listen up because Japan is

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,130
becoming an experiments on how to deal

220
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,930
with demographic ageing and I think

221
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,250
their solution is probably going to

222
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:49,960
surprise you

223
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,580
the social revolution okay something is

224
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,320
very clear for Japan in such an old

225
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,790
country where the population is expected

226
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,710
to decrease significantly during the

227
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,990
upcoming decades only productivity and

228
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,060
investment in technology and robots can

229
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,400
save them but dear viewer this takes

230
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,200
time and of course to be able to invest

231
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,090
as much as they need they have to become

232
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,220
a prosperous economy so the question is

233
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,740
how can a stagnating economy recover and

234
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,780
keep public finances under control while

235
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,670
the population ages at full speed

236
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,080
especially when you consider what an

237
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
aging population means in terms of

238
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,150
pensions and health spending

239
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,040
well the Prime Minister believes that

240
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,810
it's essential to increase latent

241
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,339
participation in the short-term raise

242
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,870
the percentage of people who work and

243
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,760
that's precisely what is happening in

244
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,500
Japan

245
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,290
[Music]

246
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,090
but have you noticed this how are they

247
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,410
managing to increase the number of

248
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,060
workers in a country if the population

249
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,220
is both shrinking and aging at a rapid

250
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,500
pace so what is Japan doing to solve

251
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,280
this problem

252
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,320
well folks the answer is that Shinzo Abe

253
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,090
a is leading a social revolution in

254
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,190
Japan obviously with less demanding jobs

255
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,110
and shorter shifts this has led to more

256
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,700
than Harville Japanese men aged between

257
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,920
65 and 70 going back to work this is

258
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,360
more than double the average in the OECD

259
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,790
countries which includes almost all of

260
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,110
the most developed countries have you

261
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,190
ever seen the movie the intern with the

262
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,240
Robert De Niro well it's kind of

263
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,350
something like that

264
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,949
[Music]

265
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:31,029
on the other hand the government is also

266
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,490
promoting a historic increase in female

267
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,439
labor participation which in Japan has

268
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,360
not traditionally been very high Japan

269
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,100
is experiencing a huge transformation

270
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,959
the number of women working and

271
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,429
occupying leadership positions is

272
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,350
growing this change has been driven by

273
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,089
what has become known as women anomic

274
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,980
s-- this is a policy that for example

275
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,540
has increased daycare services

276
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,490
incentivized part-time contracts and

277
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,139
encouraged companies to adjust their

278
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,759
schedules to the needs of women with

279
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,619
children this is an Japan has become one

280
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:57,519
of the countries with the greatest

281
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,869
percentage of working women today

282
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,339
however the truth is that despite all

283
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,600
these measures the Japanese economy

284
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,059
still needs many workers in fact there

285
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:08,499
are so many vacancies that there are

286
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,059
currently more than a hundred and fifty

287
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,730
jobs for every 100 candidates yep you

288
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,290
heard that right there are more jobs

289
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,209
available than candidates many more

290
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,009
that's why in recent years Shinzo Abe a

291
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:19,749
has been demolishing what has been for

292
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:23,920
so long a taboo in Japanese society

293

294
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,490

[Music]

296
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,430
since time immemorial Japan has been one

297
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,810
of the country's most close to

298
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,610
immigration in the world we already

299
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,620
talked about this a while ago on visual

300
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,850
politic in Japan the immigrant

301
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,470
population accounts for only 1.8 percent

302
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,180
of the total this is one of the lowest

303
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,010
percentages if not the lowest percentage

304
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,950
in the entire developed world however as

305
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:58,610
changing Japan to Asia give us you're

306
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,920
young you're skilled you're eager

307
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,170
workers since Shinzo Abe a came to power

308
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,180
in 2012 the number of foreigners has

309
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,600
doubled and that won't be the end of it

310
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
in December 2018 Japan approved new laws

311
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,490
to boost the arrival of immigrants we

312
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,350
need to break free of conventional

313
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,570
thinking I will create a Japan that can

314
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,730
attract great talent from around the

315
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,650
world folks the new regulations make

316
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,810
allowances for two new statuses for the

317
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,640
foreign population on the one hand very

318
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,170
appealing status to attract the most

319
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,910
qualified workers who can settle in

320
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,860
Japan practically indefinitely with

321
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,920
their families on the other hands

322
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,330
there's a new status designed so

323
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,800
industries can bring in less qualified

324
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,870
workers here the conditions are more

325
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,670
limited but even so the new regulation

326
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,290
seeks to eliminate all the problems and

327
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,970
the bad conditions that these foreign

328
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,260
workers have typically suffered

329
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,640
something that we already talked about

330
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,050
in another video

331
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,970
[Music]

332
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,070
in any case folks Japan has many many

333
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,420
problems and we've talked about them

334
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,580
many times and we intend to do so in the

335
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,620
future but there are also reasons it can

336
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,360
remain one of the richest countries in

337
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,980
