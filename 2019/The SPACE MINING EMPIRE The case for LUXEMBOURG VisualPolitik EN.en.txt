exploring the final frontier not because

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,220
they are easy but because they are hard

plenty to exploit out there in the solar

is the industry over tomorrow or maybe

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,240
it's the industry of today and well what

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,220
does Luxemburg have to do with all of

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,120
this pay attention because this video is

gonna blow your mind everyone wonders

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,330
about life on other planets but who

40
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,090
cares about little green men when you

41
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,610
can find natural resources can imagine

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,530
it mining for gold on Mars or

43
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,990
discovering uranium on some asteroid

44
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,540
near Venus this might be sounding rather

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,130
like science fiction do you well

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,170

several space agencies have already

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,560
found the most valuable asteroid near

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,600
Earth and that's davida it has a

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,310
diameter of three football fields with a

55
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,360
resource value of an estimated 27

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,340
quintillion US dollars and I'm not

57
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,730
making that number up that's 27 with 18

58
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,010

59
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,990
own solar system like Titan orbiting

60
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,570

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,550
so imagine what could happen if one day

64
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,650
we could cheaply exploit these resources

65
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,870
it would mean pretty much free energy

66
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,460
for everybody but here comes the

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,230
question if you find gold in Australia

68
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,350
then that gold belongs to Australians it

69
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,750
will be extracted following Australian

70
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,850
law pretty simple now some countries

71
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,410
have strict regulations other countries

72
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,330
have more flexible ones that everybody

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,750
understands who regulates what but what

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,690
happens when that gold is on Mars who

75
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,390
regulates that exactly and can private

76
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,640
companies extract it and if that does

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,900
happen what happens if two private

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,280
companies fight over the mining rights

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,250
of one asteroid well so far nobody

80
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,450
really seems to care about these

81
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,540
potential issues except one country

82
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,650
Luxembourg

83

84
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,450
yeah and that's Luxembourg that tiny

85
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,739
European country with a smaller

86
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:57,079
population than Manhattan as we told you

87
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,209
in this video Luxembourg is one of the

88
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,400
wealthiest countries on earth and when

89
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,409
you have so much money you invest your

90
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,040
money and invest it they have in 2016

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,629
the space resources initiative was

92
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,030
established and with it two hundred and

93
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,859
twenty three million dollars of its

94
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:14,900
national space budget was set aside for

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,060
companies working towards space mining

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,400
and as we said space mining it sounds

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,079
pretty amazing but I mean how can you

98
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,490
invest in something when you don't even

99
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,530
know it's gonna be legal but if there's

100
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,300
something Luxembourgish politicians like

101
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,570
it's money money and expertise in space

102
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,639
basically during the 1980s Luxembourg

103
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,229
was one of the first countries to pass

104
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,660
regulations on commercial satellites so

105
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,889
it's actually kind of sounds like the

106
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,480
perfect job for them

industry and Planetary Resources two of

116
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,129
the leading companies in the field are

117
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:04,050
already working with Luxembourg's

118
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,060
governments in November of 2016

119
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,000
Planetary Resources & Luxenberg struck a

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,669
28 million dollar investment deal in

121
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,159
exchange for an unspecified equity stake

122
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,780
in the company both companies predict

123
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,449
that as soon as 2025 resources like

124
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:20,729
water oxygen hydrogen and precious

125
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,400
metals will be able to be extracted but

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,289
the question here is how can Luxembourg

127
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,930
become a leader in this field and we're

128
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,180
really serious about it and how much

129
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,520
money is involved well today we're gonna

130
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,919
answer all of those questions but before

131
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,820
we do let's look back at the history

132
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,759
[Music]

133
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,009
eagled and mars sending a spacecraft to

134
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,740
an asteroid pretty expensive so you know

135
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,719
if Mohammed cannot go to the mountain

136
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,360
the mountain must come to Muhammad

137
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,380
literally here we're not talking about

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,969
going to an asteroid that's way too

139
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:55,469
ambitious what we're talking about is

140
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,360
moving an asteroid away from its normal

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,669
path and causing her to orbit our planet

142
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,250
yes that really is possible that let us

143
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,599
start from the beginning according to a

144
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:05,669
study published in 2012 by the Keck

145
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:07,860
Institute for Space Studies a CR or

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,259
asteroid capture and return missions are

147
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:11,969
going to be feasible in the near future

148
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,490
this kind of mission will make hundreds

149
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,469
of tons of asteroid material available

150
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:19,080
within the earth-moon system and well

151
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,909
what does all of this mean well a visit

152
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,680
to a nearby captured asteroid would

153
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,449
allow for shorter trips for astronauts

154
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,819
which in turn would mean less of a

155
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,680
potential radiation hazard for the crew

156
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,569
and also more time to work on the

157
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,349
materials found in the asteroid

158
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,119
and also there's gonna be far less money

159
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,819
wasted on resources and fuel but I could

160
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:40,599
probably guess what you're thinking

161
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,830
right now

162
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,099
how on earth or should I say how not on

163
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,199
earth have the Space Agency's figured

164
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,909
out how to capture an asteroid and bring

165
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,789
it into our planet's orbit even a tiny

166
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:54,369
asteroid will weigh millions of tons so

167
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:56,080
we can't just arrive with a crane and

168
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,710
move it

169
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,020
look when an asteroid passes close to a

170
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,449
planet or a large moon its orbit changes

171
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,210
basically a smaller body gets attracted

172
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,369
to a bigger one if we can just push an

173
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:07,959
asteroid a little bit so that it gets

174
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,999
closer to the moon the asteroid can be

175
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,830
pulled into orbit around the Earth and

176
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,539
this could be done with a

177
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:20,800
remote-controlled rocket and if you

178
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,959
think I've lost my mind here it's far

179
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,969
from it in fact what I just told you is

180
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,069
the summary of a paper from the Keck

181
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:28,959
Institute based in California and this

182
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,330
paper was published in 2012 that's seven

183
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,369
years before we even made this video so

184
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,479
now you might be wondering is it

185
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,039
possible to take rock samples from an

186
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,259
asteroid right now and the answer to

187
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,959
that is yes the first ones to accomplish

188
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,849
this worth of Japanese the Japanese

189
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,740
Space Agency launched a robotic

190
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,719
spacecraft called Hayabusa this

191
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:48,849
spacecraft traveled to the asteroid to 5

192
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:52,569
143 Itokawa in 2010 they already had

193
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:55,120
samples from it and they're not the only

194
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,370
ones NASA launched another spaceship in

195
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,459
2016 the osiris-rex whose goal is to

196
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:06,440
reach an asteroid named Ben mu

197
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,880
spacecraft approached the asteroid in

198
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,760
August 2018 extended an articulated arm

199
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,680
and took a sample of the asteroids

200
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,690
surface material the spacecraft is going

201
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,300
to return to Earth in 2023 of course all

202
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,790
of these missions are not exactly space

203
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,160
mining but they are testing all of the

204
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,320
technologies that would be required for

205
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,330
commercial scale space mining this is

206
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,030
why in 2014 Planetary Resources revealed

207
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,740
a full-scale prototype of its new

208
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,419
spacecraft that will search for

209
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,940
promising mining sites but as I said at

210
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,190
the beginning this is not the end of the

211
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,140
story because nothing is ever that

212
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,930
simple especially when it comes to space

213
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,550
part of the main issue is that we don't

214
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,310
really know much about asteroids many of

215
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,260
them appear to be rubber piles and in

216
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,840
some cases these piles spin so rapidly

217
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,670
that they look more like flying saucers

218
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,950
other asteroids due to their composition

219
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,050
they might be exceptionally awkward to

220
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,270
manipulate we might however have more

221
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,580
options with solid bodies a spaceship

222
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,860
can dock on an asteroid and push against

223
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,630
it but there are complications due to

224
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,270
microgravity and asteroid rotation it is

225
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,860
possible that a number of cables could

226
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,380
be looped around the asteroid to hold it

227
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,240
securely in place all of this would

228
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,030
require a lot of fuel and a great deal

229
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,130
of money but anyway we're veering a

230
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,020
little too into the realm of Science and

231
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,270
Technology here so let's go back to the

232
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,430
political side of space mining shall we

233
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,360
[Music]

234
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,780
the lux

235
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,330
space empire as the developments of the

236
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,160
space mining industry progresses the

237
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,530
need for a legal framework a regulating

238
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,080
space resource utilization increases the

239
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,290
Outer Space Treaty of 1967 was the first

240
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,510
to attempt some sort of international

241
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,900
space law framework but during the time

242
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,730
the treaty was signed nobody really

243
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,950
cared about commercial space exploration

244
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,230
instead in the midst of the Cold War

245
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,030
there was a lot of concern about using

246
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,730
space as a battlefield this is why the

247
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,920
treaty focuses mostly on those matters

248
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
[Music]

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,000
anyway international treaties they're a

250
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,310
pretty weird animal in fact there's no

251
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,380
world police that's going to enforce

252
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,709
them

253
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,600
all we have are international sanctions

254
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,220
and I mean give the Trump and pence

255
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,810
administration another term and they'll

256
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,990
bring a space force orb so they say the

257
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,250
other day cuz we're doing a tremendous

258
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,529
amount of work in space I said maybe we

259
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,180
need a new force we'll call it the space

260
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,120
force and I was not really serious and

261
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
then I said what a great idea maybe

262
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,720
we'll have to do that that could happen

263
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,180
this is not exactly the first time u.s.

264
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,709
president has said something like this

265
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,560
in 1983 President Reagan proposed the

266
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,300
creation of the Strategic Defense

267
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,910
Initiative SDI

268
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,270
this is a project to build a space-based

269
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,010
anti-ballistic missile system of course

270
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,500
media immediately started calling it

271
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,780
Star Wars purpose of this project was to

272
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,910
defend the u.s. from Soviet missiles by

273
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,100
intercepting them during various phases

274
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,320
of their flight this technology proved

275
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,330
to be too complex and the project was

276
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,760
soon cancelled but the point here is

277
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,770
that nobody seemed to care about this

278
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,140
project violating the Outer Space Treaty

279
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,630
that said when it comes to space mining

280
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,220
the treaty states the following

281
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,360
[Music]

282
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
the activities of non-governmental

283
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
entities in outer space including the

284
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,839
moon and other celestial bodies shall

285
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,449
require authorization and continuing

286
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:36,339
supervision by the appropriate state

287
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,589
party to the treaty in other words the

288
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:41,499
treaty has two key points the first is

289
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,239
that a non-governmental entity this is a

290
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,129
private business must receive permission

291
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,139
from their country in order to operate

292
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,179
in outer space and the second point is

293
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,619
that you can do as much research as

294
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,299
you're once that's okay with everybody

295
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:55,119
but what about making profits I mean

296
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,759
this is really where nobody knows what

297
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,829
to do and this is where two countries

298
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,869
come into the picture America and

299
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:02,820
Luxembourg

300
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,430
[Music]

301
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,100
these are pioneers in creating a legal

302
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,530
framework to provide legal certainty for

303
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,900
investors and mining companies and this

304
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,060
is very important because both America

305
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,070
and Luxembourg have very special ways of

306
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,870
approaching mining most resource rich

307
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,270
countries like Saudi Arabia or Argentina

308
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,640
consider those resources to be strategic

309
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,710
this means as I've already mentioned

310
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,420
that if you live in Argentina and you

311
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,610
find oil it doesn't belong to you but

312
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,050
rather to the government and the

313
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,180
government can decide when and how to

314
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,940
exploit those resources in America and

315
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,830
in Luxembourg the private owner is the

316
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,080
one who decides this means that so far

317
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,030
companies will have a bigger role in

318
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,920
space mining and this also means that

319
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,330
many other countries and experts have

320
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,670
come up with criticisms a lot of that

321
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,500
criticism was heard during a UN

322
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,240
subcommittee that deals with the

323
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,370
peaceful use of space but more

324
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,260
controversial than the American law is

325
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,060
the Luxembourgish one one of the ways

326
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,100
vocal critics is gabriel zucman a

327
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,780
foreign left-wing economist who studied

328
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,860
under the French economist Thomas

329
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,440
Piketty in case you don't know picady is

330
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,210
the author of capital in the 21st

331
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,550
century a very notable book that's sort

332
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:18,760
of a revival of marxist theory this is

333
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,100
what being in offshore financial centre

334
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,650
means it's not diversification it's just

335
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,690
extending the logic of being a tax haven

336
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,690
to a new area gabriel zucman economist

337
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,640
at UC berkeley basically the Luxembourg

338
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,070
law differs from the American one in one

339
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,110
very important way the American law says

340
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,520
that they will only give permits to

341
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,890
American mining companies an American

342
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,360
mining company must have officers on

343
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,850
American soil and the owners must be

344
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,580
American residents but in the case of

345
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,650
Luxembourg you just need to create a

346
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,570
company with fiscal residence in

347
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,920
Luxembourg

348
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,120
in other words let's say an Australian

349
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,040
company wants to do mining on one

350
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,960
satellite well they just need to create

351
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,360
a branch with a legal address in

352
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,280
Luxembourg and there doesn't even need

353
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,020
to be a big facility they're simply a

354
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,750
mailbox is enough and then suddenly boom

355
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,700
you have the legal vehicle that you need

356
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,580
to go and find gold on Mars in other

357
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,500
words Americans can reap the benefits of

358
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,300
American companies doing space mining

359
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,790
while Luxembourgers will open up a brand

360
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,200
new industry to the rest of the world

361
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,630
and this is why so many investors are

362
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,640
choosing this country as a place to

363
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,800
start research projects this brand new

364
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,660
industry is precisely the target

365
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,090
audience of the Luxembourg space cluster

366
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,890

00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,810
the visibility of Luxembourg space

and an average turnover of approximately

375
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,569
2 billion euros yes two billion the

376
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,269
industry today encompasses 25 companies

377
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,249
and two public research organizations

378
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:01,319
but hold on a second because not

379
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,910
everything is sunshine and rainbows

380
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,220
Luxembourg still has to go through a lot

381
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,350
of Hoops to completely privatize space

382
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,239
mining article 1 paragraph 1 of the

383
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,920
Outer Space Treaty is a pretty

384
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,110
interesting clause the states are under

385
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,759
the obligation to share the benefits

386
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,739
resulting from their exploration of

387
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:20,770
outer space

388
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,490
this could mean that if the

389
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,110
luxembourg-based company makes a profit

390
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,480
they couldn't take all of that profit

391
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,890
somehow they would have to work out a

392
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,630
way to share it with more than a hundred

393
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,400
and ninety countries that exists on

394
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,920
earth which makes it sound like not such

395
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,110
a great deal well luckily for Luxembourg

396
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,060
international law is very easy to

397
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,700
reinterpret in fact having no legal

398
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,530
precedents for space mining it's hard to

399
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,240
determine what exactly it does mean to

400
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,130
share the benefits with the rest of the

401
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,540
world perhaps you could claim that

402
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,030
mining in itself benefits humankind as a

403
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,710
whole maybe we could even sort things

404
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,510
out with some sort of international tax

405
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,940
that would be collected by but we'll

406
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,320
figure that out later it would be

407
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,360
collected by somebody so far what we can

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,590
say is there's virtually nobody

409
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,290
enforcing international law all we have

410
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,140
is two countries America and Luxembourg

411
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,720
with a clear business friendly legal

412
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,520
framework there now is your turn do you

413
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,650
think we're ready for space mining would

414
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,180
you like to see it become commonplace in

415
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,250
the next few years well please leave
