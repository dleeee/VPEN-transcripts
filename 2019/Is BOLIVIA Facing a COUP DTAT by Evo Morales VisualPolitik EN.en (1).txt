dear viewer on fiscal policy I think

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,809
most of you will agree achieving a

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,120
strong democracy ain't an easy thing in

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,949
our worlds there are many democracies

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,289
but unfortunately really there aren't

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,820
that many high quality ones and

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,230
obviously when I'm talking about quality

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,789
here I mean it's a democratic system

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,980
that respects individual freedom legal

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,050
security political plurality you know

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,890
important things like that teaching

man well when it comes down to it

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,670
there's one basic principle that's

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,460
essential for any quality democracy and

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,219
it isn't usually liked by politicians

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,809
and here I'm talking about

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,910
Ulsan nations something that's essential

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,190
in order to stop any single person or

oh yeah kisses Patty and Aladdin Chrissy

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,760
it's precisely due to this concern that

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,770
many countries have a limitation of

31
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,010
mandates nothing is as dangerous as

32
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,590
allowing the same citizen to stay in

33
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,810
power for a long time the people get

them from here usurpation and tyranny

00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,030
emerge Seamon believe our folks trying

37
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,740
to prevent political alternation at any

38
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,920
cost isn't new or indeed rare throughout

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,990
the world and in recent years in one way

40
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,850
or another Latin America has been

41
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,830
plagued with politicians who've managed

42
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,650
to retain power at all costs politicians

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,900
like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua horn

44
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,090
Orlando Hernandez in Honduras and

45
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,920
Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela now the

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,110
latest person to join this list seems to

47
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,360
be the Bolivian President Evo Morales

48
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,369
and the question many of you are

49
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,950
probably asking right now is is Bolivian

50
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,410
democracy actually in danger what

51
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,750
exactly is happening and why is ever

57
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,870

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,760
first indigenous president in the a

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,040
hundred and ninety three years that have

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,350
passed since Bolivia's independence his

61
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,150
arrival to power meant the end of

62
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,340
political exclusion for most of Bolivian

63
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,410
society in fact from a historical

64
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,090
perspective I think Morales is rise to

65
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,510
power it was sort of inevitable

66
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,520
[Music]

67
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,800

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,720
Yankee imperialism and in favor of the

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,550
political participation of indigenous

70
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,380
peoples in the nationalization of

71
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,690

72
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,970
to lead a transformation in the country

73
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,400
a transformation that had white popular

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,470
support to achieve his objectives the

75
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,000
Bolivian government opted for something

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
that has become very fashionable in

77
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,990
Latin America in recent years and that's

78
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,270
changing the Constitution something that

79
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,520
by the way also gained a lot of popular

80
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,220
support as election after election fo

81
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,040
morales swept the polls

82
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,920
[Music]

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,530
but let's get back to the Constitution

84
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,650
to ever Morales own Constitution this is

85
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,480
what his article 168 set the mandate of

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,220
the state's president or vice president

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,950
lasts for five years and they may be

88
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,590
reelected only once on a continuous

89
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,500
basis article 168 of the Bolivian

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,260
Constitution it's pretty clear right on

91
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,480
a continuous basis a person can only

92
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,580
exercise the office of president for two

93
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,180
turns and each term lasts five years

94
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,280
thus as Morales ran for re-election in

95
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,590
2009 his time in government should have

96
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,459
ended in 2014 rice I mean that's basic

97
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,000
mathematics

[Music]

101
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,260
just hold on a minute because something

102
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
doesn't fit it it's the year 2018 and

103
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,960
ever Morales is still in power and is

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,650
going to run for re-election in 2019 so

105
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,210
now the question in your mind is well

106
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:51,810
what the hell happens well listen up the

107
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,599
indefinite re-election

108
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,020
folks this is the story of how a man

109
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,259
fell in love with power so let's see a

110
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,909
Vosges Constitution established

111
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,219
alternation as a necessary principle in

112
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:07,709
order for democracy to work but as soon

113
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,149
as the new constitution was approved

114
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,819
problems began ever said okay the

115
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,529
previous mandate it didn't count because

116
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,029
you know that happened under a different

117
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,490
constitutions so just as the Bolivian

118
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,469
state had to be refounded they needed to

119
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,099
reset the score to 0 and yes it is as

120
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,309
absurd as it sounds alternation isn't a

121
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,139
punishment it's a way of preventing a

122
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,330
person from being in power for too long

123
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,580
and if you believe in it and introduce

124
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,289
it into the Constitution that you

125
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,869
yourself have promoted your kind of

126
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,819
should respect it right

127
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,999
well actually no in fact everywhere

128
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,189
allas managed to get a positive ruling

129
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,379
from the Constitutional Court on a very

130
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:51,089
controversial case according to the

131
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,949
court Morales had been the president of

132
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,749
Bolivia but now we wanted to become the

133
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:57,059
presidents of the pleura national state

134
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,189
of Bolivia which is not the same thing

135
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:01,080
so he could govern for two more

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,820
consecutive terms

137
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,710
see the difference well overnight

138
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,630
Bolivia the Bolivia that had always

139
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,090
existed had simply disappeared

140
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,340
this explains why he ran in the 2009

141
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,410
elections and again for re-election in

142
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,500
2014 but of course he wouldn't be able

143
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,420
to run again and actually Morales

144
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,550
himself has said this plenty of times

145
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,040
he said that in 2019 he's going to leave

146
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
the world of politics to open his own

147
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,820
restaurants but hold on a second because

148
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,350
uber alles yeah the restaurant sounded

149
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,730
really great but you know what else

150
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,450
sounded really great staying in power

151
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,039
[Music]

152
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,729
so yeah in 2015 just one year after his

153
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,680
reelection deputies are related to the

154
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,419
president's presented a proposal to

155
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,639
reform the Constitution theme newly

156
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,559
approved Constitution by the way and I'm

157
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:56,119
betting you can guess what they wanted

158
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,129
to do to it yes the change they wanted

159
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,479
to push through was that the president

160
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,149
could be reelected two times so that

161
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,580
yes Morales could run again in 2019

162
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,460
however this time the shot backfired the

163
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,830
reform did go ahead in Parliament but it

164
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,360
also had to be approved by referendum

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,990
and their rather surprisingly Morales

166
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,030
lost

167
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,650
[Music]

168
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,710
do you agree with the reform of article

169
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,440
168 of the political constitution of the

170
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,760
state so that the president and

171
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,470
vice-president of the state can be

172
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,960
reelected twice in a continuous way a

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,030
question of the 2016 Bolivian

174
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,190
constitutional referendum the question

175
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,919
was clear and the answers even more so

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,000
yes or no yes or no to re-election and

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,340
the Bolivians they said no but what do

178
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,770
you think Evo Morales did did he accept

179
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,570
the result of this referendum and the

180
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,100
Constitution that he himself had

181
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,650
embraced and promoted well no obviously

182
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,430
not

183
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,350
the indigenous leader the politician he

184
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,060
was going to return sovereignty to the

185
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,250
people he suddenly came and said

186
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,960
basically all right well the people in

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,160
the referendum they were basically

188
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
manipulated you know we don't need to

189
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,760
take them into account but really

190
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,930
despite of all this in spite of

191
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,150
everything he did promise to respect the

192
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,650
results and I ain't got to be wondering

193
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,690
well did he really and the answer was

194
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:20,090
well no see taking advantage of his

195
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,830
control over the institution's which is

196
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,750
precisely what alternation tries to

197
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,490
avoid Morales managed to do something

198
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,380
unheard of the pleura National

199
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,570
Constitutional Court that body tasked

200
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,460
with interpreting fundamental rule in

201
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,520
its 84 2017 ruling declared parts of the

202
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,800
Constitution itself as invalid to

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,300
justify such a measure they used

204
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,490
international law and the Constitutional

205
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,589
Court devoted itself to assessing and

206
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,540
interpreting the American Convention on

207
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,279
Human Rights the inter-american Court

208
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,110
jurisprudence everything but the

209
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,630
National Constitution itself

210
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,790
in the end the result of this entire

211
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,680
experiment was that the articles that

212
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,089
bothered Morales from his own

213
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,610
Constitution were de facto repealed and

214
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,709
it was ruled listen to this that

215
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,230
indefinite re-elections were a human

216
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,540
right this is because they interpreted

217
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,430
it is basically that limiting mandates

218
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,380
and demanding alternation is an

219
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,019
undermining of human rights mm-hmm in

220
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,880
short let's get serious because it's no

221
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,160
joke when a politician can undo whatever

222
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,600
he pleases with his country's

223
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,550
institutions this is something that's

224
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,529
incredibly dangerous the fact is that in

225
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,350
Bolivia article 168 hasn't been repealed

226
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,660
or modified what happens is that now the

227
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,029
Bolivian Constitution has parts that are

228
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,899
upheld and other parts that are not all

229
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,300
of this has unleashed protests against

230
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,370
Morales anti-democratic drift both

231
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,230
inside and outside of the country of

232
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,850
course in the face of such a spectacle

233
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,139
several members of the Electoral

234
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:48,540
Tribunal have resigned and have been

235
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,579
replaced by people close to Morales his

236
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,040
own party thus finally on December 4th

237
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
2018 this body approved even more

238
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,509
Alice's candidacy to the presidency and

239
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,579
Alvaro Garcia llanera to the vice

240
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,430
presidency nothing is as dangerous as

241
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,009
allowing the same citizen to stay in

242
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:07,230
power for a long time the people get

243
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,779
used to obeying him and him to leading

244
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,569
them from here usurpation and tyranny

245
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,899
emerge Seamon Bolivar but just a second

246
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,430
I know some of you might be thinking

247
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,930
right now you might be thinking well

248
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,430
hold on Simon they're still gonna be

249
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,199
election store right I mean if the

250
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,970
Bolivians don't want him then they

251
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,399
shouldn't voted for him right well folks

252
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,560
there are actually two problems with

253
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,750
this first a democracy never ever can

254
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,790
consist of tyranny of the majority over

255
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,980
the minority institutions need to be

256
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,170
respected and their mechanisms must

257
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,819
exist to prevent a politician from

258
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:40,410
clinging to power through the use of

259
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,389
techniques such as client holistic

260
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,189
voting dependence on the government's

261
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:46,199
control of the media fortress simple

262
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,630
coercion the second problem has a lot to

263
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,000
do with the obsession with power that

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,020
Morales has shown

265
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,820
[Music]

266
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,010
in other words how far ever Morales and

267
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,720
his party the movement to socialism

268
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,850
willing to go in order to stand power

269
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,550
[Music]

270
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,320
ever lost the referendum then distill

271
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,750
running he's moved heaven and earth just

272
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,580
to be a candidate again so now the

273
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,800
question is will he be willing to lose

274
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,780
the elections or will he opted instead

275
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,360
for the strategy of winning at any cost

276
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,070
I'm referring to the strategy this kept

277
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,050
people like Nicolas Maduro Daniel Ortega

278
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,540
and Juan Orlando Hernandez in power it's

279
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,090
kind of the usual move this is the

280
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,500
question that many are asking themselves

281
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,180
in Bolivia right now and watch out

282
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,440
because what Evo Morales has achieved

283
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
besides being the Bolivian politician

284
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,340
who's been in power the longest is

285
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,080
getting his country's institutions to

286
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,530
act on his will Bolivians protests on

287
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,510
mass against Evo Morales

288
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,910
illegal attempts to remain in power

289
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,130
anyway folks era visual politic will be

290
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,780
very very attentive to whatever may come

291
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,760
