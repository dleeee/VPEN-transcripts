00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,219
earthquakes earthquakes are one of the

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,200
natural phenomena that have impacted the

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,310
history of mankind the most

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:23,870
[Music]

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,360
they've destroyed entire cities and

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,280
taken the lives of millions upon

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,980
millions of people that's really nothing

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,470
new what is new is knowing how to resist

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,780
them how to survive and make safer

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,820
buildings and safer infrastructure this

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,489
is indeed a very new phenomenon and when

14
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:41,960
it comes to earthquake proofing there

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,430
are two countries that have had to learn

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,860
a lot Chile and Japan are two of the

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,170
most seismically active countries on the

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,560
planet

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,050
[Music]

20
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,420
together they account for almost 40

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,400
percent of all seismic activity that

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,620
happens in the world in fact Chile has

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,300
suffered the most powerful earthquake

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,700
ever recorded the Valdivia earthquake in

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,880
1960 they recorded a magnitude of 9.5 on

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,780
the Richter scale

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,670
a true Cataclysm but this is not so

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,960
unusual when you consider that both

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,810
Japan and Chile lie directly above the

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,729
Ring of Fire a stretch of 40,000

31
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,530
kilometers that accounts for most of the

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,510
seismic and volcanic activity on earth

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,910
in this zone tectonic plates subduct

34
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,100
that is one slides under the other

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,979
generating subduction zones the movement

36
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,259
of the plates is not constant or regular

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,420
it happens with southern poles and when

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,490
both plates are very stressed and have a

39
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,009
lot of accumulated energy they yield let

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,619
go and move suddenly generating strong

41
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,720
earthquakes that is why 90% of all

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,940
earthquakes in the world and 80% of the

43
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,340
most powerful ones the megathrust happen

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,680
in the Ring of Fire in fact Japan and

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,180
Shelley's earthquakes are very similar

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,830
in magnitude and duration as you can

47
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,020
imagine this challenge comes with one

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,080
choice and that's adapt we all die today

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,640
on visual politic we're gonna tell you

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,709
how these countries managed to adapt

51
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,690
what the main differences between them

52
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,030
are and the great common challenge that

53
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:22,580
Japan and Chile face so listen up

54
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,380
Chile and Japan learning from mistakes

55
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,910
the most destructive earthquakes have

56
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,710
terrible consequences we're talking

57
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,480
about phenomena that can end the lives

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,940
of tens of thousands of people in just a

59
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,550
few minutes to sin think Chile and Japan

60
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,140
are the most advanced countries in

61
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,360
seismic disaster prevention for one

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,520
simple reason throughout their history

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,470
they've undergone terrible tragedies

64
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,270
that have taught them a very valuable

65
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,490
lesson it's worth spending more at the

66
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,530
outset to save on human and

69
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,350
magnitude of what we're talking about

70
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,120
here let's focus on just one example

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,849
marks the 11th 2011 is one of those

72
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,250
dates that we all surely remember that

73
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,920
day a huge 9.1 magnitude earthquake was

74
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,900
centered on the Miyagi Prefecture in

75
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,540
Japan but it shook a large part of the

76
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
country including the capital of Tokyo

77
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,200
the Great Eastern earthquake and the

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,989
subsequent tsunami left almost 16,000

79
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,330
people dead and more than 6,000 injured

80
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,010
and yes we're talking about the same

81
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,599
earthquake that caused the Fukushima

82
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,670
disaster

83
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,280
this was Japan's latest mega-quake but

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,319
the Japanese know that there's a 70%

85
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,970
chance of another mega earthquake

86
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,060
happening in Tokyo in the next 30 years

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,540
[Music]

88
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,829
and yes okay the vast majority more than

89
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,650
85% of Tokyo's buildings are considered

90
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,510
resistant but the fact that sixteen

91
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,099
thousand hectares of the Japanese

92
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,900
capital is covered in wooden buildings

93
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,970
that does not help

94
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,310
according to song simulations the gas

95
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,260
leaks that are commonly produced by a

96
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,030
large earthquake could cause fires

97
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,650
throughout the city and could destroy

98
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,530
more than 600,000 buildings so the

99
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,630
consequences they go far beyond tremors

100
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,580
and possible landslides and of course

101
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,830
all of this generates awareness both

102
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,350
social and political meanwhile in Chile

103
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,850
they are somewhat behind but the shock

104
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,070
of 2010 made them take risk prevention

105
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:30,410
even more seriously an eight point eight

106
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,110
magnitude earthquake shakes Chile the

107
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,690
earthquake lasting one minute was felt

108
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,520
in the capital where the electrical

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,860
service was interrupted the tsunami that

110
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,630
the earthquake caused reached Hawaii

111
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,760
Chile's earthquake affected 70% of the

112
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,320
country's population but thanks to

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,240
anti-seismic regulations only two of the

114
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,130
capital's high-rise buildings collapsed

115
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,360
and in the face of such a strong

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,650
earthquake that was actually quite a

117
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,540
success especially considering the

118
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,660
precedence of the Latin American region

119
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,040
Chile's investments in resilient

120
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,200
infrastructure early warning systems and

121
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,180
urban planning have managed to ensure

122
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,430
that this time the number of victims is

123
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,940
low

124
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,650

the saying goes better safe than sorry

131
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,190
but how of Japan and Chile achieved

132
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,320
these levels of risk prevention how do

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,120
their models differ what are the

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,430
weaknesses and what are the keys to

saving lives

137
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,319
if there's a risk get ahead of it when

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,029
we talk about earthquakes we must keep

139
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,409
two things in mind they're unpredictable

140
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,479
and they're inevitable however what can

141
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,369
be predicted and avoided are the risks

142
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,589
that arise when an earthquake occurs you

143
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,269
see earthquake damage prevention can be

144
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:58,719
done in two ways active or passive for

145
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,819
example after the Valdivia earthquake of

146
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,159
1960 the strongest ever recorded which

147
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,229
caused a huge tsunami the pacific

148
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,089
tsunami warning system and mitigation

149
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,279
system was created by the unesco

150
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,719
Intergovernmental oceanographic

151
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:13,629
Commission in 1965 intending to

152
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:19,330
disseminate early tsunami alerts

153
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,220
but don't worry the age of the system

154
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,930
shouldn't scare you it's been updated

155
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,090
over time the fact is that this is one

156
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,680
of the best examples of active

157
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,199
prevention

158
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,110
the tsunami in the Pacific has a huge

159
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,150
propagation capacity and it can be very

160
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,550
destructive usually there is about a 20

161
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,960
to 30 minute window between an

162
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,849
earthquake happening under a row near

163
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,259
the sea and a tsunami hitting the

164
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,029
nearest coast but in the case of the

165
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,610
2011 earthquake in Japan in some areas

166
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,099
only two minutes passed before the alert

167
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,099
and the tsunami making landfall and of

168
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,599
course in the cases of phenomena that

169
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,610
require massive evacuations and which

170
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,650
affect huge regions early warnings are

171
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,080
massively important the more time people

172
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,090
have the better and every second really

173
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,810
does count

174
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,090
in fact a strong earthquake originating

175
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,830
in Chile can cause such a large tsunami

176
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,960
that it can affect very distinct coasts

177
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,880
throughout the Pacific such as Japan New

178
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:23,700
Zealand America and even the Philippines

179
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,670
and that is precisely why Japan also

180
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,620
implemented its own early warning system

181
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,390
which has been greatly improved since

182
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,730
the 2011 catastrophe since that year

183
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,500
more than twenty five billion dollars

184
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,060
have been invested into earthquake

185
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,950
sensors to reach two hundred and eighty

186
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,870
points it's the densest and most

187
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,080
reliable network in the world

188
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,539
however the biggest challenge by far is

189
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,610
passive prevention that is all those

190
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,199
measures and standards that aim to

191
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
minimize damaged buildings and therefore

192
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,490
the number of victims and in this Japan

193
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,590
is the undisputed leader Japan's strict

194
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,080
building codes save lives but how

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,139
exactly does it work well check this out

196
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,580
although the first Japanese anti-seismic

197
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,440
construction regulations date back to

198
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,509
1924 most of the buildings have been

199
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:17,770
built under two very different

200
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,780
regulations the oldest one called kyo

201
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,360
tycion dates back to 1950 and focused on

202
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,629
preventing buildings collapsed the new

203
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,090
Kyoto Shin Thai shitin from 1981

204
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,349
requires buildings to remain

205
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:31,599
structurally sounds and show at most

206
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,729
only cracks after medium to strong

207
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,570
earthquakes these rules have evidently

208
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,409
been partially reinforced over the years

209
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,789
it's precisely due to this that the

210
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,380
structures of the buildings in Japan are

211
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,970
mostly made out of steel which is much

212
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,100
more flexible and resistant movement

213
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,810
than Richard Congress furthermore in

214
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,790
some cases cross beams that absorb

215
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,680
energy from the earth Quaker also

216
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,209
installed and of course they also have

217
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,860
seismic dampers at the base of the

218
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,640
tallest buildings Chile on the other

219
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,200
doesn't require buildings to withstand

220
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,540
damage regulations are more oriented

221
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,399
towards preventing their collapse its

222
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,930
current regulation is more similar to

223
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,480
the Japanese one of 1950 in this aspect

224
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
you can see the huge difference in

225
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,750
vision that Chile has where regulation

226
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,730
is much less strict that is to say in

227
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,560
Chile they seek to save lives but

228
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,360
without requiring buildings to remain

229
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
unscathed and there's really a

230
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,329
fundamental reason for this and that's

231
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,000
the cost

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,870
[Music]

233
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,100
building a building as resilient as

234
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,620
those in Japan can cost around 10 to 15%

235
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,600
more than a regular one and of course

236
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,610
this makes housing prices in newer and

237
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,500
more resistant buildings more expensive

238
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,029
the philosophy is if you live here

239
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,110
you'll be safe

240
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,790
but hold on just a second we're assuming

241
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,100
that rules are always met and codes are

242
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,600
always followed and that everyone is

243
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,459
working for the common good when the

244
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,649
truth might be rather different in fact

245
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,360
you know what the number one problem is

246
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,250
that affects security and can cost many

247
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,050
lives well think about it for a second

248
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,040
maybe you got it

249
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,040
[Music]

250
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,150
attention corruption kills yes you heard

251
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,860
that correctly it might surprise you but

252
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,480
corruption is without a doubt to the

253
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,490
greatest threat to security in terms of

254
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,050
earthquakes and no neither Japan nor

255
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,700
Chile are free of this scourge because

256
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,440
even though Japan has the image of an

257
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,450
ideal country and Chile ranks in acid'

258
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,490
respectable number 27 in the corruption

259
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,870
perception index from time to time

260
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,990
scandals like this one crop up the KYB

261
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,910
corporation a Japanese company dedicated

262
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,770
to the development and manufacture of

263
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,930
seismic dampers admitted at the end of

264
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,420
2008 that they had falsified the quality

265
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,190
and performance data of their products

266
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,160
for more than a decade to date they

267
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,630
haven't yet been able to quantify the

268
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,730
real scope of the risk that this entails

269
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,930
but it's estimated that the

270
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,700
effectiveness of the falsified products

271
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,460
could be at around 86% of the minimum

272
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,670
requirements required by law buildings

273
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,440
as important as Tokyo City Hall's the

274

at earthquake shock absorber maker KYB

281
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,970
corporation although this case is quite

282
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,860
serious the truth is that Japan doesn't

283
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,630
have much corruption and that means that

284
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,670
seismic regulations are followed most of

285
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,980
the time

286
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,020
chili on the other hand has the lowest

287
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,850
corruption level in all of Latin America

288
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,650
which is contributed to the facts that

289
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,960
anti-seismic regulations in construction

290
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
are complied with in the vast majority

291
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,950
of cases although as we've seen they are

292
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,730
less stringent than Japan's we have a

293
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,890
law that states the design of a certain

294
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,080
height must be reviewed by an

295
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,450
independent team that verifies that the

296
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,430
standards are being met no one builds

297
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,860
without this backing Sergio super Veda

300
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,650
you know what it's precisely this broad

301
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,420
compliance with regulations that makes

302
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,580
Chile a much safer country to live in

303
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,830
than for example Mexico during an

304
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,850
earthquake

305
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,920
corruption and negligence caused

306
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,300
landslides during Mexico City earthquake

307
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,100
Mexico one of the countries with the

308
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,720
highest corruption rates in the region

309
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,290
is also a seismically active country

310
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,300
the difference with chili is that in

311
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,190
Mexico cities every time there's a

312
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,900
strong earthquake several buildings

313
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,090
collapse leaving numerous victims and

314
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,710
although not all earthquakes have the

315
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,750
same characteristics but reasons such as

316
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,000
the type of soil and depth Mexico City

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,870
lost 228 people in the city alone and

318
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,520
369 across the entire country when an

319
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
earthquake hit on September the 19th

320
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,200
2017 on the other hand the 2015

321
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,450
earthquake in Kimbo Chile which was felt

322
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,150
with an intensity of 7 in Santiago only

323
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,010
caused 15 fatalities throughout the

324
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,430
country

325
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,620
this is a great example of earthquake

326
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,510
prevention there for Mexico and other

327
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,399
highly seismic countries need to catch

328
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,529
up and work hard and honestly for the

329
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,830
safety of their citizens
