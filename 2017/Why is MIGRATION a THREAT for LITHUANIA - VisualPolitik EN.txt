3
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:12.509
in 1991 after several years of

4
00:00:10.41 --> 00:00:14.880
negotiations and a whole lot of tension

5
00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.160
the Baltic states Lithuania Latvia and

6
00:00:14.88 --> 00:00:19.920
this dunya finally managed to break away

7
00:00:17.16 --> 00:00:21.210
from the Soviet Union they finally had

8
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:21.850
the freedom that they'd wanted for so

9
00:00:21.21 --> 00:00:39.569
long

10
00:00:21.85 --> 00:00:39.569
[Music]

11
00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.320
since then fifty years have passed since

12
00:00:41.64 --> 00:00:45.510
the soldiers of the Red Army occupied

13
00:00:43.32 --> 00:00:47.309
these countries but during the years

14
00:00:45.51 --> 00:00:49.649
under the Soviets repression and fear

15
00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.600
were the basic ingredients in the lives

16
00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.609
of the people in Estonia Latvia and

17
00:00:51.6 --> 00:00:56.219
Lithuania let's now have a look at some

18
00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.229
pretty alarming data in Lithuania alone

19
00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.120
in a country of little more than 2.5

20
00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:05.240
million people these numbers were

21
00:01:00.12 --> 00:01:09.210
recorded 200,000 people were arrested

22
00:01:05.24 --> 00:01:10.229
questioned and prisoned 132 thousand

23
00:01:09.21 --> 00:01:13.080
people were deported

24
00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.479
especially to Siberia only five thousand

25
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:19.800
prisoners deportees and partisans were

26
00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.240
eliminated by the Soviet regime and if

27
00:01:19.8 --> 00:01:23.159
all of that wasn't enough but the time

28
00:01:21.24 --> 00:01:25.470
of their independence poverty and

29
00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.509
shortages were everyday realities for

30
00:01:25.47 --> 00:01:31.289
all of the inhabitants of these country

31
00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.479
I remember the days when the counters of

32
00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.610
the shops and to Lynn were empty and the

33
00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.170
people were starving economy more or

34
00:01:35.61 --> 00:01:39.060
less had to be rebuilt from scratch

35
00:01:37.17 --> 00:01:41.789
since then the view of things have

36
00:01:39.06 --> 00:01:43.590
changed a lot there more than a lot in

37
00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.810
fact from the very moment these

38
00:01:43.59 --> 00:01:48.450
countries regained their independence

39
00:01:45.81 --> 00:01:49.280
they decided to bet it all on democracy

40
00:01:48.45 --> 00:01:52.420
and freedom

41
00:01:49.28 --> 00:01:54.490
[Music]

42
00:01:52.42 --> 00:01:56.439
their economies are today some of these

43
00:01:54.49 --> 00:01:59.409
freest ones they are members of the EU

44
00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.420
and NATO and they prosper today these

45
00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.860
are countries with very high standards

46
00:02:01.42 --> 00:02:04.540
of living and they can really be

47
00:02:02.86 --> 00:02:06.759
considered rich countries the

48
00:02:04.54 --> 00:02:10.720
transformation it really has been total

49
00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.280
and remarkable in 2009 they suffered

50
00:02:10.72 --> 00:02:14.170
along with the rest of the world through

51
00:02:12.28 --> 00:02:16.390
these financial crisis and it really

52
00:02:14.17 --> 00:02:18.720
seemed as if their economies were on the

53
00:02:16.39 --> 00:02:22.120
verge of collapse

54
00:02:18.72 --> 00:02:24.280
last year's economy contracts almost 18

55
00:02:22.12 --> 00:02:26.680
percent in the fourth quarter of 2009

56
00:02:24.28 --> 00:02:29.140
but against all odds they managed to

57
00:02:26.68 --> 00:02:31.510
recover in a very short period of time

58
00:02:29.14 --> 00:02:33.489
indeed they became an example to other

59
00:02:31.51 --> 00:02:35.980
countries like Spain Greece and Portugal

60
00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.450
but that's a whole different thing that

61
00:02:35.98 --> 00:02:39.640
we're going to talk about in the future

62
00:02:37.45 --> 00:02:41.680
video in this video we're going to focus

63
00:02:39.64 --> 00:02:43.750
on Lithuania and talk about a problem

64
00:02:41.68 --> 00:02:45.549
that is shared by a lot of the countries

65
00:02:43.75 --> 00:02:47.799
in Eastern Europe a problem that today

66
00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.060
is actually one of the biggest threats

67
00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.400
to their future

68
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:56.819
[Music]

69
00:02:53.4 --> 00:02:56.819
brain drain

70
00:02:57.0 --> 00:03:01.330
the history of litter a Nia and all of

71
00:02:59.62 --> 00:03:03.610
the Baltic states in general since their

72
00:03:01.33 --> 00:03:05.770
freedom in 1991 well it's a history of

73
00:03:03.61 --> 00:03:07.750
success today they are modern modes and

74
00:03:05.77 --> 00:03:10.930
countries with prosperous economies but

75
00:03:07.75 --> 00:03:13.330
as with any good story not everything is

76
00:03:10.93 --> 00:03:15.610
quite so pretty yes there are issues

77
00:03:13.33 --> 00:03:17.370
these countries are facing and today

78
00:03:15.61 --> 00:03:19.690
we're going to particularly focus on

79
00:03:17.37 --> 00:03:21.190
Lithuania in this country the biggest

80
00:03:19.69 --> 00:03:23.980
problem is brain drain

81
00:03:21.19 --> 00:03:27.450
yep that's emigration with an E and this

82
00:03:23.98 --> 00:03:30.370
is no small problem for the country

83
00:03:27.45 --> 00:03:32.740
since 2004 when the country was

84
00:03:30.37 --> 00:03:34.930
integrated into the EU but away Nia has

85
00:03:32.74 --> 00:03:38.080
lost more than 10% of its population

86
00:03:34.93 --> 00:03:40.300
that is more than 300,000 people

87
00:03:38.08 --> 00:03:42.250
especially young people have decided to

88
00:03:40.3 --> 00:03:45.130
pack up and move to a different country

89
00:03:42.25 --> 00:03:48.760
most of those have chosen to move to the

90
00:03:45.13 --> 00:03:50.620
United Kingdom yeah while in Western

91
00:03:48.76 --> 00:03:52.090
Europe and the United States they are

92
00:03:50.62 --> 00:03:53.920
concerned about immigration in

93
00:03:52.09 --> 00:03:56.260
miscellanea it is the other way around

94
00:03:53.92 --> 00:03:57.940
they are concerned about people leaving

95
00:03:56.26 --> 00:04:02.590
they are worried that this might end up

96
00:03:57.94 --> 00:04:04.630
D capitalizing the country since 1990 we

97
00:04:02.59 --> 00:04:06.670
have lost about 800,000 people and for a

98
00:04:04.63 --> 00:04:08.980
small country this is a huge loss we are

99
00:04:06.67 --> 00:04:10.600
losing our youngest and brightest and in

100
00:04:08.98 --> 00:04:13.390
the future we will just have old people

101
00:04:10.6 --> 00:04:15.970
who will be dying we will have a dying

102
00:04:13.39 --> 00:04:17.739
Society and as always the ones who are

103
00:04:15.97 --> 00:04:19.570
leaving tend to be the most capable and

104
00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.370
the best prepared young people this of

105
00:04:19.57 --> 00:04:22.900
course has a significant impact on the

106
00:04:21.37 --> 00:04:25.000
country's economy the number of young

107
00:04:22.9 --> 00:04:28.120
people working decreases talent leaves

108
00:04:25.0 --> 00:04:32.390
the country and the population ages but

109
00:04:28.12 --> 00:04:34.979
this is not just a problem for Lithuania

110
00:04:32.39 --> 00:04:38.020
[Music]

111
00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.970
there's the early 1990s some 20 million

112
00:04:38.02 --> 00:04:41.949
of Central and Eastern Europe's most

113
00:04:39.97 --> 00:04:44.379
talented workers have left and they have

114
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.090
headed largely to Western Europe so who

115
00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.340
do you think has benefited from all of

116
00:04:46.09 --> 00:04:50.319
this talent redistribution yeah you got

117
00:04:48.34 --> 00:04:52.719
that right it's the wealthiest countries

118
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.490
and that is why we have to be careful

119
00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.199
about the messages being sent by

120
00:04:54.49 --> 00:04:58.569
politicians who are attempting to

121
00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.210
criminalize immigration in order to get

122
00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.580
votes yes we're looking at you to reason

123
00:05:01.21 --> 00:05:04.990
a and Donald Trump thought I mean I know

124
00:05:03.58 --> 00:05:07.629
you're thinking if the Baltic countries

125
00:05:04.99 --> 00:05:09.879
have been so successful why are people

126
00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.490
leaving well because they are looking

127
00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.319
out for their own personal success look

128
00:05:12.49 --> 00:05:16.810
for one these countries have managed to

129
00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.060
develop a well-prepared young population

130
00:05:16.81 --> 00:05:20.319
who can also speak English to must have

131
00:05:19.06 --> 00:05:22.539
as when it comes to looking for a future

132
00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.550
in another place and then we also have

133
00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.590
the fact that because of all the growths

134
00:05:24.55 --> 00:05:28.539
that have happened since 1991 these

135
00:05:26.59 --> 00:05:30.370
people it can now leave the country in a

136
00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.439
comfortable way but there is still the

137
00:05:30.37 --> 00:05:34.779
key question to answer why are they

138
00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:38.879
leaving if things are going so well well

139
00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.879
that's not really that hard to explain

140
00:05:42.4 --> 00:05:46.270
even though salaries have improved a lot

141
00:05:44.41 --> 00:05:48.490
in the last several years the difference

142
00:05:46.27 --> 00:05:51.850
between the wealthiest countries is

143
00:05:48.49 --> 00:05:54.340
still quite big at an example while the

144
00:05:51.85 --> 00:05:56.590
average salary in Lithuania is about 800

145
00:05:54.34 --> 00:05:58.870
euros in the United Kingdom it is almost

146
00:05:56.59 --> 00:06:01.060
two thousand five hundred euros or three

147
00:05:58.87 --> 00:06:02.229
times more all of this what I might

148
00:06:01.06 --> 00:06:04.449
leave you wondering whether this

149
00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.160
impressive economic development was

150
00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.620
actually good for the Baltic countries

151
00:06:06.16 --> 00:06:10.780
well we would say that overall yes it's

152
00:06:08.62 --> 00:06:12.430
certainly worth it but it does leave us

153
00:06:10.78 --> 00:06:14.500
with a couple of very important

154
00:06:12.43 --> 00:06:16.600
questions well the first one is what is

155
00:06:14.5 --> 00:06:21.760
the cost of all of this and second how

156
00:06:16.6 --> 00:06:25.090
can they stop the brain drain putting an

157
00:06:21.76 --> 00:06:26.380
end to emigration so stopping this brain

158
00:06:25.09 --> 00:06:28.570
drain it's become a pretty major

159
00:06:26.38 --> 00:06:30.250
priority for Eastern European countries

160
00:06:28.57 --> 00:06:32.560
in some of these countries like Poland

161
00:06:30.25 --> 00:06:34.840
Latvia and Hungary they have started a

162
00:06:32.56 --> 00:06:38.860
return campaign in order to persuade

163
00:06:34.84 --> 00:06:40.510
emigrants to come back home I would

164
00:06:38.86 --> 00:06:42.729
welcome all Polish people who went

165
00:06:40.51 --> 00:06:46.750
abroad if only they could come back it

166
00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:48.849
would be a great day for Poland however

167
00:06:46.75 --> 00:06:50.770
while this is it's a nice sentiment it

168
00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.419
is definitely in this urania where there

169
00:06:50.77 --> 00:06:53.979
is a larger concern about the brain

170
00:06:52.419 --> 00:07:01.750
drain that there has been more

171
00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:03.910
significant support from society the

172
00:07:01.75 --> 00:07:06.340
last parliamentary elections celebrated

173
00:07:03.91 --> 00:07:09.130
in October the Lithuanian greens and

174
00:07:06.34 --> 00:07:11.080
farmers union won the elections and took

175
00:07:09.13 --> 00:07:13.750
control of the government this pinterest

176
00:07:11.08 --> 00:07:16.090
party had only one MP in the previous

177
00:07:13.75 --> 00:07:20.500
elections their main promise putting an

178
00:07:16.09 --> 00:07:22.780
end to emigration well of course this is

179
00:07:20.5 --> 00:07:25.210
easier said than done so the question is

180
00:07:22.78 --> 00:07:27.340
how is this party going to succeed party

181
00:07:25.21 --> 00:07:29.560
led by the way--by rameneh's cabacas´s

182
00:07:27.34 --> 00:07:30.220
one of the most important businessman in

183
00:07:29.56 --> 00:07:32.320
the country

184
00:07:30.22 --> 00:07:34.690
well apparently their top priority is to

185
00:07:32.32 --> 00:07:36.520
stop emigration by attracting much more

186
00:07:34.69 --> 00:07:38.349
foreign investment they claim that if

187
00:07:36.52 --> 00:07:40.030
they can succeed in getting more foreign

188
00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.949
money for investments they will be able

189
00:07:40.03 --> 00:07:44.139
to provide more jobs with higher

190
00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:46.599
salaries so well how are they planning

191
00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:49.000
to do this well by reducing bureaucracy

192
00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:51.010
chasing corruption and also by making

193
00:07:49.0 --> 00:07:52.510
adjustments to the labor market and the

194
00:07:51.01 --> 00:07:53.360
truth is that this does make a ton of

195
00:07:52.51 --> 00:07:55.129
sense and we

196
00:07:53.36 --> 00:07:57.349
say that the Baltic countries really do

197
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:59.689
seem to know how to get things done but

198
00:07:57.349 --> 00:08:01.909
all don't for just a second because this

199
00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:04.159
it's not the end of the story there are

200
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:10.789
some other things that well they don't

201
00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:14.419
look quite so good the shadows of the

202
00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:15.889
Lithuanian plan on the one hand at the

203
00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:17.569
same time as the government promised

204
00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:20.180
foreign investments they have also

205
00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:23.150
committed to raise taxes by eliminating

206
00:08:20.18 --> 00:08:25.340
what is known as a flat tax in Lithuania

207
00:08:23.15 --> 00:08:27.169
as well as in Estonia and Latvia the tax

208
00:08:25.34 --> 00:08:29.180
systems they're really simple in

209
00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:31.279
Lithuania's case there is this flat tax

210
00:08:29.18 --> 00:08:33.019
which is a rate of 15% for people and

211
00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:35.000
companies that is to say the Delicia

212
00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:36.769
rhenium who makes $10,000 pays one

213
00:08:35.0 --> 00:08:38.810
thousand five hundred dollars in taxes

214
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:40.969
and the one who makes ten times more at

215
00:08:38.81 --> 00:08:42.829
a hundred thousand euros also pays ten

216
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.019
times more at fifteen thousand euros

217
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:46.640
raising taxes in this way sort of goes

218
00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:48.740
against the foreign investments in

219
00:08:46.64 --> 00:08:50.839
higher salaries plan and this rise will

220
00:08:48.74 --> 00:08:52.790
directly harm both of those things

221
00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:55.010
and by the way corporate taxes they're

222
00:08:52.79 --> 00:08:57.589
not as low as they might seem if we add

223
00:08:55.01 --> 00:09:00.140
up the social security contributions and

224
00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:02.149
other taxes companies pay more than 40%

225
00:09:00.14 --> 00:09:05.060
of their gross profits and taxes

226
00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:06.680
according to the World Bank and now we

227
00:09:05.06 --> 00:09:09.769
also have to point out the issue of

228
00:09:06.68 --> 00:09:11.540
russia-nato the previous Lithuanian

229
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:13.550
governments and the current is no

230
00:09:11.54 --> 00:09:15.769
exception have insisted on scaring the

231
00:09:13.55 --> 00:09:17.959
population and also the rest of the

232
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:21.370
world with the Russian threat saying

233
00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:23.630
that the country is constantly in danger

234
00:09:21.37 --> 00:09:25.490
okay now while it is true that these

235
00:09:23.63 --> 00:09:27.769
threats are real it's not really a

236
00:09:25.49 --> 00:09:30.290
brilliant way to instill confidence in

237
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:33.019
potential investors and finally and

238
00:09:30.29 --> 00:09:35.180
maybe most importantly of all there is a

239
00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:36.890
cultural matter that affects the entire

240
00:09:35.18 --> 00:09:38.269
country so you might wonder right if

241
00:09:36.89 --> 00:09:39.890
there's this brain drain going on

242
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:41.899
wouldn't it be logical to try and

243
00:09:39.89 --> 00:09:43.880
compensate for this by bringing in young

244
00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:46.040
professionals from other countries well

245
00:09:43.88 --> 00:09:48.260
that's kind of a problem because this

246
00:09:46.04 --> 00:09:49.820
country it's also a bit suspicious about

247
00:09:48.26 --> 00:09:52.699
immigration most of these countries

248
00:09:49.82 --> 00:09:54.410
they're a touch nationalist anyway if

249
00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:56.360
anything is for certain is that list

250
00:09:54.41 --> 00:09:58.160
Urania is rather dystonia and latvia

251
00:09:56.36 --> 00:09:59.930
have done their homework and their

252
00:09:58.16 --> 00:10:01.520
policies are certainly much more

253
00:09:59.93 --> 00:10:03.410
efficient than the ones that predominate

254
00:10:01.52 --> 00:10:05.250
in the rest of europe remember in just

255
00:10:03.41 --> 00:10:06.900
25 years they have managed to

256
00:10:05.25 --> 00:10:09.030
comment rich countries with high

257
00:10:06.9 --> 00:10:10.230
standards of living and well now would

258
00:10:09.03 --> 00:10:12.300
like to know what you think do you think

259
00:10:10.23 --> 00:10:13.830
these countries will finally be able to

260
00:10:12.3 --> 00:10:15.510
stop this brain drain well we're looking

261
00:10:13.83 --> 00:10:17.460
