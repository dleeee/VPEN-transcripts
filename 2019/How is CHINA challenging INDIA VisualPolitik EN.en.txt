[Music]

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,750
this is the world's most violent tribe

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,469
known as the Sentinelese last year in

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,240
2018 an American missionary was murdered

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,790
when he tried to evangelize them Indian

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,039
officials weren't even dare to retrieve

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,199
his body nearly everyone who has ever

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,640
tried to contact them has been met with

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,779
Spears

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,320
and with errors and some unfortunately

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,220
never left the islands alive for

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,869
centuries they're from Ames virtually

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:33,750
isolated on this remote islands in the

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,360
middle of the Indian Ocean almost nobody

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,280
dares to contact dissent and he might be

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,989
wondering well why should we carry out

17
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,059
this violent tribe on this tiny and

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,070
remote islands well dear viewers that's

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,600
because it belongs to the Andaman

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
Nicobar archipelago man's well it might

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,879
not seem like much this Indian territory

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,649
is key to international trade most of

23
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,629
the oil tankers that supply China go

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,700
through this place this means that at

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,710
any point India could put some warships

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,380
here and block most of China's imports

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,720
if they did this China would collapse in

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,840
a matter of months and believe me here

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,020
India is not China's best friend

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,750
so what is China doing to avoid this so

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,270
we talking about war well hopefully not

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,670
the answer is far more complex the

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,100
answer is once again the string of

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,750
pearls and in this video we're gonna

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,110
tell you what that means

36
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,660
[Applause]

37
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,940
[Music]

38
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,350
in a previous video we discussed how

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,270
China is challenging the American Empire

40
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,280
the belton Road initiative and its

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,750
maritime counterpart the string of

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,700
pearls are a strategic plans in

43
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,500
neutralise American influence in the

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,540
Indian Ocean we previously described the

45
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,130
geopolitical theory of the string of

46
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,650
pearls with each pearl being a port that

47
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:06,619
could host a military base we said

48
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,539
America was worried about this but they

49
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,610
aren't the only ones India has several

50
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,200
reason to fear China's military

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,080
expansion - but first let's define where

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,150
these would-be military bases could be

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,530
some of the pearls could be in

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,140
Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Pakistan but

55
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,370
all in a minute because I know you're

56
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,989
thinking right now all of these projects

57
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,489
they've got nothing to do with the

58
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,260
military so far we're talking about

59
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,170
ports or airports or highways and those

60
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,550
are good for the economy right

61
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,230
I mean they really could just be good

62
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,850
investments which I knees companies I

63
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,410
mean who can blame anyone for trying to

64
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,690
make money well let's take Sri Lanka as

65
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,250
an example we're talking about a poor

66
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,380
country that just emerged from a civil

67
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,390
war this commentator for is completely

68
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,030
underdeveloped and virtually nobody

69
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,180
docks there in 2017 only 183 ships

70
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,040
arrived here throughout the entire year

71
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,650
which means most days it was completely

72
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,230
empty and yet China has invested a

73
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,810
billion dollars here and if rebuilding a

74
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,280
port wasn't enough they've also created

75
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,190
a brand new city from scratch right next

76
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,500
to it so now we might want to ask you

77
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,660
does that make any financial sense

78
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,570
whatsoever because it sure doesn't do us

79
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,390
but what if there were other reasons

80
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,850
aside from economics what if china isn't

81
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,730
worrying so much about their ROI and is

82
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,050
more worrying about their military

83
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,780
expansion think about it China is in a

84
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,460
very weak position eventually other

85
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,110
countries could block their trade route

86
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,300
hence both India and Japan might want to

87
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,250
do that at some point so far the only

88
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,380
country that guarantees safe trade in

89
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,600
the Indian Ocean is America but but

90
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
America is not exactly a hundred percent

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,709
committed to China's interest so in

92
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,990
other words China is at an existential

93
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,300
risk and they need their own security

94
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,500
and that means military bases

95
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,800
[Music]

96
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,690
now the question is why would other

97
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,940
countries let China build military bases

98
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,010
on their soil and even more importantly

99
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,380
why would those military bases be enough

100
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,750
to guarantee China's security for

101
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,760
example why would having a harbor in Sri

102
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,060
Lanka

103
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,220
keep India from blocking China's trade

104
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,870
routes well today we're going to answer

105
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,030
those questions but before we do as we

106
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,040
always do let's take a look back at the

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,780
history

108
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,880
sugar-daddy diplomacy sri lanka is that

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,979
island that you see to the south of

110
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,960
India it is around 21 million

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,660
inhabitants and little to no interest in

112
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,820
international politics until now

113
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,310
for 26 years sri lanka suffered through

114
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,930
a civil war between the governments and

115
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,760
a socialist group the Liberation Tigers

116
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,880
of Tamil alarm this was a conflict where

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
some 60,000 people lost their lives and

118
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,360
some estimations claimed that that

119
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,280
number could exceed a hundred thousand

120
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,320
there were human rights violations on

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,330
both sides and because of this the

122
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,130
international community isolated Sri

123
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,400
Lanka's government for decades

124
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,530
that means they get Bobby at weapons and

125
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,669
security assistance from the

126
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,770
international market to fight the Tamil

127
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,510
Tigers and then while the whole world

128
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,550
had turned its back on Sri Lanka a

129
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,979
single country stepped up to be their

130
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:19,560
friend

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,039
[Music]

132
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,249
- aid revealed in Sri Lanka's victory

133
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:27,949
parade this news is from 2009 back then

134
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,119
the president of Sri Lanka

135
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,339
was this man here Hindu rush park sir

136
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,099
corrupt authoritarian ruler with a never

137
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:38,930
ending hunger for power

138
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,600
he came to power in 2005 and China

139
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,160
offered him all of the military aid he

140
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,320
needed in order to defeat the Tigers

141
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,600
thanks to this in 2009 rash packs are

142
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,889
declared victory over them

143
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,900
finally the civil war was over and rash

144
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,419
boxer got all the credit for it but this

145
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,610
as you might expect is not the end of

146
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:56,270
the story

147
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,039
you see there's nothing easier than

148
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,590
playing with the egotistical dreams of a

149
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,710
power-hungry man and this is how China

150
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:14,360
they came rauch paksas sugar daddy for

151
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,680
example you want to build the tallest

152
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,979
tower in South Asia something as

153
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,270
magnificent as it is useless so

154
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,550
everybody can admire how powerful you

155
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,699
are

156
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,889
don't worry rash back sir here's some

157
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,720
money to build it with would you like to

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,060
have a modern theater with your name on

159
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,190
it so everyone can be reminded of you

160
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,120
for centuries

161
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,400
don't worry Rajapaksa here's some money

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,530
for that would you like a deep port in

163
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,840
ham bento - so you can turn your country

164
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,729
into the next Singapore don't worry

165
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,070
Rajapaksa we got some money for that too

166
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,780
and as a signer here I've been dodging

167
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,010
anger and I've seen these white

168
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,050
elephants they're kind of everywhere all

169
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,940
of them they're bought and paid for with

170
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,530
China's money and under China's

171
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,539
conditions and we're not really talking

172
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,730
about small sums of money here

173
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,979
[Music]

174
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,690
sri lankans debt crisis is so bad the

175
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,070
government doesn't even know how much

176
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,080
money it owes for a better understanding

177
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
of just how much debt we're dealing with

178
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
sri lanka's government collected 14

179
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,020
point eight billion dollars in taxes

180
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,940
last year nonetheless they're scheduled

181
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,190
debt repayments amount to twelve point

182
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,560
three billion dollars so basically all

183
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,630
their income goes towards debt

184
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,630
repayments mainly to China and still

185
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,289
they continue to even more money so what

186
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:28,850
happens when your own money to China and

187
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,160
China knows that you can't really pay

188
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,789
them back

189
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,889
well that's when that sugar-daddy

190
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,560
diplomacy comes in now yes it's true a

191
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,449
sugar daddy can offer you a life of

192
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,550
luxury but it comes at a price sometimes

193
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,039
it doesn't have to be money in fact

194
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,080
there are many ways of paying a sugar

195
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,220
daddy back Sri Lanka formally hand over

196
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,960
hambantota port to Chinese firms on a

197
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,110
99-year lease of course on this 99 year

198
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,840
lease contract it is written clearly not

199
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,780
for military purposes but some good like

200
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,250
telling China what to do with their own

201
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,710
property and look Sri Lanka is in so

202
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,720
much debt that they can't really argue

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,340
with their sugar dad today I might be

204
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,539
wondering well what's gonna happen when

205
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,090
rush pack sir is gone well we actually

206
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,770
already have the answer that question

207
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,960
despite his attempt to establish a cult

208
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,180
of personality rush packs are lost the

209
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,580
elections in 2015 and the new government

210
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,650
they've got a very anti China rhetoric

211
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,409
but again money is money and no matter

212
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,659
the ideology of the government Sri Lanka

213
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,089
is still in a debt trap alright but I

214
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:32,839
know what you're probably thinking right

215
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:34,099
now you're thinking are Sri Lanka's a

216
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,810
small country but you know what about

217
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,029
the bigger countries well let's head

218
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:44,430
over to Pakistan

219
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,589
the port of Gwadar is just another

220
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,959
example of sugar daddy Eng of a local

221
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,459
government have you ever heard of good

222
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,240
are in Pakistan

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,190
I certainly had it I had to look up the

224
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,420
name of my computer it's how to

225
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,459
pronounce that one but this area it has

226
00:08:57,459 --> 00:08:59,829
become an important gateway to the sixty

227
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,600
two billion dollar china-pakistan

228
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,019
economic corridor or the CPEC the first

229
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,399
stage of the construction report took

230
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,920
approximately 200 million dollars of

231
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,800
investments the china-pakistan economic

232
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,300
corridor is an important loop in the

233
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,639
larger chain of belton Road initiative

234
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,860
I would enable the possibility of a 21st

235
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,380
century maritime Silk Route Kili Fang

236
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,350
chairman of the National Development and

237
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,660
Reform Commission of China aside from

238
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,279
the sixty-two billion dollars a two

239
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,380
billion dollar oil refinery is planned

240
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,810
to be set up Nick wood da and you might

241
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,100
wonder well does this make economic

242
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,440
sense well in this case we have to admit

243
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,180
that it does the port of Gwadar was

244
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,649
built in a city on the shores of the

245
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,269
northern Indian Ocean close to the

246
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:45,279
Iranian border and the entrance to the

247
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,529
Persian Gulf a pipeline from there to

248
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,029
the world would allow them to easily

249
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,889
transfer energy and goods from the

250
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,449
Middle East it would also help with

251
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,579
trade between Africa the Middle East and

252
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:56,529
China in fact gouda is expected to

253
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,420
become a big commercial hub and of

254
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,940
course well it makes sense for China to

255
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,339
control that bird again over 2 billion

256
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,199
dollars is enough to make Pakistan's

257
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,959
government pretty happy and increasingly

258
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,060
dependent on China if you want to keep

259
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,670
your life of luxurious infrastructure

260
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,139
you've got to keep your sugar daddy

261
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,940
happy and in case you didn't know we're

262
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,260
not talking about a small country

263
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,480
anymore Pakistan has more than 200

264
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,699
million inhabitants and by the way it's

265
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,580
a die hard enemy of India

266
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,210
[Music]

267
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,980
and since we're talking about big

268
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,899
countries let's move on to Bangladesh

269
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,899
with 164 million inhabitants packed into

270
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,640
one hundred forty seven thousand five

271
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,260
hundred and seventy square kilometers it

272
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,540
is one of the top ten most densely

273
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,890
populated countries on the planet

274
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,220
[Music]

275
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,860
and guess who sold them most of the

276
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,260
weaponry they use why China of course

277
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,660
all those tanks anti-missile shields and

278
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,240
combat jets are manufactured in Chinese

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,190
factories oh they also paid for a

280
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,310
gigantic bridge and of course that

281
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,870
non-military port am i right

282
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,060
estimates say the Bangladesh has eight

283
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,400
billion dollars to China and their army

284
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
they're completely dependent on the

285
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,880
Chinese again this is sugar-daddy

286
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,670
diplomacy at play so hold on a second

287
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,960
because maybe this doesn't mean anything

288
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,200
to you yes but have a look at this map

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,740
[Music]

290
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,450
what the Pakistan Sri Lanka and

291
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,580
Bangladesh have in common they all

292
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,700
perfectly surround India so well why

293
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,370
does this worry India so much well let's

294
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,940
find out

295
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,690
I mean at the gates as we said India is

296
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,580
pretty much surrounded by China sports

297
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,530
of course so far these ports have no

298
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,600
military purposes whatsoever but they

299
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,810
might at some point for example in 2017

300
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,190
China wanted to dock one of their

301
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,470
submarines that the Sri Lanka port the

302
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,850
government's which was no longer Raj

303
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,890
paksas denied permission to China and

304
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,690
since the contract clearly stated no

305
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,820
military use whatsoever China had to

306
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,650
dock their submarine somewhere else but

307
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,260
we all know that eventually that's

308
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,180
probably gonna change some more debt

309
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,310
repayment negotiation and China is gonna

310
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,750
be able to ask for whatever they want so

311
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,060
well what would this mean for India

312
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,590
well do you member those and Myron's

313
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,360
nicob are islands that we talked about

314
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,070
at the beginning of this video well as

315
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,080
we said India could easily block those

316
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,300
routes the way it is now China couldn't

317
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,730
really do much to avoid that but imagine

318
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,860
what would happen with Chinese military

319
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,900
bases surrounding India all of a sudden

320
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,310
China would be able to send troops to

321
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,530
India's mainland on all sides

322
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,480
this explains why Narendra Modi India's

323
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,220
Prime Minister is so scared about

324
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,470
China's expansion and is playing a

325
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,150
double strategy on the one hand

326
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,190
diplomacy Indian Prime Minister Narendra

327
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,140
Modi to visit China for one-on-one

328
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,300
summit with Xi Jinping but on the other

329
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,910
hands they've got what we could call the

330
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,860
karaoke strategy basically if China is

331
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,110
building a string of pearls India wants

332
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,730
to do the same but hold on a second

333
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,920
because China has money to sugar daddy

334
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,530
with but India I mean they're growing a

335
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,390
lot lately but they're not exactly China

336
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,580
so without so much money they're kind of

337
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,500
relying on another powerful weapon and

338
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,130
that's fear

340
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,880
think about it a lot of countries are

341
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,200
concerned about China's military

342
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,820
expansion and that's where India

343
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,920
basically goes and says hey guys we

344
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,150
should only do something about this

345
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,000
one example is with France in 2080 New

346
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,290
Delhi's government signed a strategic

347
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,690
pact with France opening up their naval

348
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,340
bases to each other's warships across

349
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,140
the Indian Ocean this means that the

350
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,270
Indian Navy now has access to strategic

351
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,340
ports like the one in Djibouti home to

352
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,730

as China extends its naval dominance the

356
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,820
Indian Ocean India's traditional area of

357

influence but Moody doesn't stop there

358
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,720
New Delhi's government is not staying

359
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,760
still while China tries to seduce other

360
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,320
countries in the Indian Ocean he

361
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
finalized an agreement for a new base in

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,160
the Seychelles and also negotiated

363
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,440
access to naval facilities in a man so

364
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,240
what does signing all these treaties and

365
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,400
agreements mean for India it means that

366
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,290
they now have access to their own string

367

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,370
expansion

373
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,810
last summer taiwan's president Chang

374
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,520
Wang said that China is a threat to

375
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,710
global democracy and so the Taiwanese

376
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,390
government is partnering with Europe as

377
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,220
well as Japan in the u.s. in order to

378
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,350
bolster its defense against China while

379
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,510
in the past decade China has promoted

380
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,190
itself as the leading source of

381
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,780
infrastructure funding in Southeast Asia

382
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,510
now India is directly positioning itself

383
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,430
as China's competitor but one country

384
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,560
isn't enough India needs an ally to

385
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,120
contain Beijing's maritime expansion

386
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,700
India is looking at Japan as that

387
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,300
possible ally the second meeting of

388
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,390
Japan India act East 4 so do you see

389
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,610
what we see China is trying to surround

390
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,400
Indira now India is trying to surround

391
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:02,980
China

392
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:11,700

393
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,460
in geopolitics we have a name to

394
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,990
describe this and it's called a Mexican

395
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,150
standoff a Mexican standoff is a

396
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,400
situation in which two or more countries

397
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,500
competing over something can't really

398
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,930
win and so are basically just waiting

399
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,670
for the other to make a false move or

400
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,950
for someone from the outside to step in

401
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,060
so now we've got to ask the question

402
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,980
well what's the potential outcome of all

403
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,170
of this well that would be military

404
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,420
escalation basically unless they come up

405
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,070
with a compromise they both need to keep

406
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,080
expanding their military in order to

407
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,350
deter it would be attack

408
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,950
