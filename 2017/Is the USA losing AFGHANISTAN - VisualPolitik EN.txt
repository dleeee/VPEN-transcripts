3
00:00:07.7 --> 00:00:13.019
Afghanistan is a difficult country in

4
00:00:10.32 --> 00:00:14.730
many aspects and difficult honestly

5
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.320
doesn't really cover it

6
00:00:14.73 --> 00:00:18.060
Afghanistan is a very mountainous

7
00:00:16.32 --> 00:00:19.680
country almost three-quarters of its

8
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:22.050
surface is covered by mountains and

9
00:00:19.68 --> 00:00:23.519
peaks that in many cases exceed 20,000

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:25.199
feet so you can probably imagine just

11
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.849
how difficult communications are among

12
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.529
the different regions of this country

13
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
and as if this was not enough it's also

14
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.329
a landlocked and mostly arid place in

15
00:00:30.96 --> 00:00:40.079
fact deserts are not unusual at all in

16
00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.390
Afghanistan so despite a few valleys its

17
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
national landscape is mainly composed of

18
00:00:42.39 --> 00:00:46.500
red and yellow tones but geography is

19
00:00:44.82 --> 00:00:48.239
not the worst part of this country and

20
00:00:46.5 --> 00:00:50.250
neither is its harsh climate conditions

21
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.559
not at all in fact poverty corruption

22
00:00:50.25 --> 00:00:54.600
and especially fundamentalism and

23
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.910
violence are the worst parts of this

24
00:00:54.6 --> 00:01:00.780
place Afghanistan's a viewer above all

25
00:00:56.91 --> 00:01:03.090
is a country of war in 1878 the Sauer

26
00:01:00.78 --> 00:01:06.869
Revolution a communist based revolution

27
00:01:03.09 --> 00:01:08.640
took place one year later in 1979 the

28
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.200
Soviet army invaded the country to

29
00:01:08.64 --> 00:01:12.200
consolidate the communist government

30
00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.619
since then the people have not known

31
00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.149
what peace means but before to be honest

32
00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.100
the situation it wasn't really good

33
00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.350
either Afghanistan was theirs and

34
00:01:23.1 --> 00:01:27.390
probably will be for a long time one of

35
00:01:25.35 --> 00:01:29.429
the poorest countries on earth it's also

36
00:01:27.39 --> 00:01:33.350
got one of the hardest and most hostile

37
00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.350
living conditions especially for women

38
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.469
in this country six out of every ten

39
00:01:35.97 --> 00:01:39.060
people don't how to read or write almost

40
00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.679
half of its population doesn't have

41
00:01:39.06 --> 00:01:42.750
access to drinking water and it's

42
00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.759
difficult to find a single family which

43
00:01:42.75 --> 00:01:46.560
hasn't been devastated by war and

44
00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.119
violence we can safely say that if

45
00:01:46.56 --> 00:01:50.399
someone was able to choose where they

46
00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.319
were to be born no one would ever choose

47
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.810
Afghanistan the last great conflict

48
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.509
which still persists to this day burst

49
00:01:54.81 --> 00:01:59.459
onto the global stage in October of 2001

50
00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.560
when the President of the United States

51
00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.110
at the time George W Bush decided to

52
00:02:01.56 --> 00:02:05.849
invade Afghanistan as a response to 9/11

53
00:02:04.11 --> 00:02:07.860
at that time Afghanistan was led by the

54
00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.660
Taliban a radical religious political

55
00:02:07.86 --> 00:02:12.569
group which protected members of al

56
00:02:09.66 --> 00:02:14.819
Qaeda including Osama bin Laden on my

57
00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.970
orders the United States military has

58
00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.980
begun strikes against al Qaeda terrorist

59
00:02:17.97 --> 00:02:22.049
training camps and military

60
00:02:19.98 --> 00:02:24.690
installations of the Taliban regime in

61
00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.370
Afghanistan the invasion it was fast

62
00:02:24.69 --> 00:02:28.920
the Taliban simply weren't an obstacle

63
00:02:26.37 --> 00:02:30.720
for the massive American war machine 16

64
00:02:28.92 --> 00:02:32.850
years and three presidents later though

65
00:02:30.72 --> 00:02:35.340
and it has been named by many as the

66
00:02:32.85 --> 00:02:37.109
longest war in US history it's already

67
00:02:35.34 --> 00:02:38.880
longer than the war in Vietnam and

68
00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.750
believe it or not the u.s. they're not

69
00:02:38.88 --> 00:02:41.750
winning that war

70
00:02:43.61 --> 00:02:47.590
[Music]

71
00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.319
what's happening

72
00:02:47.59 --> 00:02:51.580
16 long years of conflicts occupation

73
00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.500
and hundreds of billions of dollars

74
00:02:51.58 --> 00:02:55.420
later and it would seem logical to think

75
00:02:53.5 --> 00:02:57.370
that the US and NATO could have managed

76
00:02:55.42 --> 00:02:59.050
to have the situation under control and

77
00:02:57.37 --> 00:03:01.300
Afghanistan would be close to reaching

78
00:02:59.05 --> 00:03:03.160
peace right well nothing is further from

79
00:03:01.3 --> 00:03:05.200
reality the truth is that with each day

80
00:03:03.16 --> 00:03:06.670
that goes by the Taliban regain grounds

81
00:03:05.2 --> 00:03:08.410
just take a look at this map from The

82
00:03:06.67 --> 00:03:12.220
Washington Post the colored areas are

83
00:03:08.41 --> 00:03:14.440
the ones controlled by the Taliban and

84
00:03:12.22 --> 00:03:17.019
well this map shows the situation at the

85
00:03:14.44 --> 00:03:18.610
beginning of 2017 but today things are

86
00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.650
even worse because as we've just said

87
00:03:18.61 --> 00:03:25.720
the Taliban are regaining ground almost

88
00:03:20.65 --> 00:03:27.489
every day the most recent estimates show

89
00:03:25.72 --> 00:03:29.650
that the governments of Kabul US and

90
00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.480
NATO control less than 60% of the

91
00:03:29.65 --> 00:03:33.459
territory and the next map is going to

92
00:03:31.48 --> 00:03:35.950
show even more Taliban controlled

93
00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.769
regions the Afghan government controls

94
00:03:35.95 --> 00:03:40.630
just 57% of its territory us watchdog

95
00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.670
says but the loss of control by the

96
00:03:40.63 --> 00:03:44.920
Afghan governments and thus the u.s.

97
00:03:42.67 --> 00:03:47.410
shouldn't be just seen as a territorial

98
00:03:44.92 --> 00:03:48.760
loss but also an economic loss for

99
00:03:47.41 --> 00:03:50.470
example it's really important that we

100
00:03:48.76 --> 00:03:52.780
ask ourselves how can the Taliban

101
00:03:50.47 --> 00:03:54.880
finance their activity where do all of

102
00:03:52.78 --> 00:03:57.730
their resources come from well basically

103
00:03:54.88 --> 00:03:59.200
that would be from heroin production as

104
00:03:57.73 --> 00:04:01.630
you might know Afghanistan is the

105
00:03:59.2 --> 00:04:03.700
biggest opium producer in the world

106
00:04:01.63 --> 00:04:05.890
and this opium well that's the raw

107
00:04:03.7 --> 00:04:07.810
ingredient that is used in heroin and

108
00:04:05.89 --> 00:04:09.040
listen Afghanistan is not just the

109
00:04:07.81 --> 00:04:12.640
world's biggest producer

110
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:15.099
it controls between 80 and 90% of opium

111
00:04:12.64 --> 00:04:17.350
production globally

112
00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.090
the opium comes from Papa sauver samne

113
00:04:17.35 --> 00:04:22.330
from the most popular plant among the

114
00:04:19.09 --> 00:04:24.750
Afghan opium farmers in this country

115
00:04:22.33 --> 00:04:27.400
most of the population lives off farming

116
00:04:24.75 --> 00:04:29.710
we can say that most of the Afghan

117
00:04:27.4 --> 00:04:32.259
economy relies on two fields that's

118
00:04:29.71 --> 00:04:34.000
international soldiers and opium in fact

119
00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.500
there's little more to their economy

120
00:04:34.0 --> 00:04:37.060
than that so for quite a while the

121
00:04:35.5 --> 00:04:38.830
Taliban have controlled the opium

122
00:04:37.06 --> 00:04:40.720
production in this country but now they

123
00:04:38.83 --> 00:04:43.300
also have realized that they can produce

124
00:04:40.72 --> 00:04:45.610
the heroin themselves which is a much

125
00:04:43.3 --> 00:04:47.410
more profitable activity and well that's

126
00:04:45.61 --> 00:04:49.419
exactly what they're doing everything

127
00:04:47.41 --> 00:04:51.520
they harvest is duly processed inside

128
00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.289
the country they receive more revenue if

129
00:04:51.52 --> 00:04:55.210
they process the opium before it has

130
00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.280
left the country William Brown field

131
00:04:55.21 --> 00:04:59.110
u.s. assistant secretary for drugs and

132
00:04:57.28 --> 00:05:00.729
law enforcement estimates show that the

133
00:04:59.11 --> 00:05:02.800
Taliban could be raising about three

134
00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.750
billion dollars every year from this and

135
00:05:02.8 --> 00:05:06.310
that's despite all the money that the US

136
00:05:04.75 --> 00:05:08.020
has wasted trying to stop these

137
00:05:06.31 --> 00:05:10.210
activities and effort this as you can

138
00:05:08.02 --> 00:05:11.910
see from this chart hasn't been at all

139
00:05:10.21 --> 00:05:16.639
helpful

140
00:05:11.91 --> 00:05:18.530
[Music]

141
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.629
so despite all the effort made by the

142
00:05:18.53 --> 00:05:22.520
u.s. opium production remains at very

143
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.110
high levels as a consequence of having

144
00:05:22.52 --> 00:05:25.969
all of these resources the Taliban

145
00:05:24.11 --> 00:05:27.409
they're managing to sustain a war that

146
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.389
is not just allowing them to regain

147
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.580
ground but has also plunged the country

148
00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.460
into violence and worst of all is that

149
00:05:31.58 --> 00:05:35.990
future predictions they're not very good

150
00:05:33.46 --> 00:05:37.460
the Taliban are getting stronger the

151
00:05:35.99 --> 00:05:39.460
government is on the retreat they're

152
00:05:37.46 --> 00:05:42.199
losing ground the Taliban day by day

153
00:05:39.46 --> 00:05:44.330
abdul-jabbar Caramon a retired general

154
00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.310
listen to this the Taliban army has

155
00:05:44.33 --> 00:05:48.680
increased from between two thousand to

156
00:05:46.31 --> 00:05:51.050
ten thousand soldiers in 2005 to more

157
00:05:48.68 --> 00:05:53.180
than 60,000 today but at this point the

158
00:05:51.05 --> 00:05:55.610
question has become why is the u.s.

159
00:05:53.18 --> 00:05:56.980
losing this war or at least why aren't

160
00:05:55.61 --> 00:06:00.049
they winning

161
00:05:56.98 --> 00:06:00.049
[Music]

162
00:06:02.98 --> 00:06:09.530
the Afghan trap the United States has

163
00:06:08.03 --> 00:06:12.199
tried many different strategies in

164
00:06:09.53 --> 00:06:13.820
Afghanistan but it seems that nothing is

165
00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.500
working in fact generally speaking

166
00:06:13.82 --> 00:06:17.419
there's quite a lot of pessimism over

167
00:06:15.5 --> 00:06:19.310
this conflict and this is not just a

168
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.260
matter of more or less soldiers when

169
00:06:19.31 --> 00:06:23.600
Barack Obama was a candidate for

170
00:06:21.26 --> 00:06:26.710
president he repeated all the time that

171
00:06:23.6 --> 00:06:29.240
Afghanistan was a war they need to win

172
00:06:26.71 --> 00:06:31.370
did not finish the job against al Qaeda

173
00:06:29.24 --> 00:06:33.440
in Afghanistan we did not develop new

174
00:06:31.37 --> 00:06:35.389
capabilities to defeat a new enemy or

175
00:06:33.44 --> 00:06:36.919
launch a comprehensive strategy to dry

176
00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.900
up the terrorist base of support

177
00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.610
we did not reaffirm our basic values or

178
00:06:38.9 --> 00:06:42.320
secure our homeland it's time to turn

179
00:06:40.61 --> 00:06:44.270
the page when I am president we will

180
00:06:42.32 --> 00:06:45.889
wage a war that has to be won Barack

181
00:06:44.27 --> 00:06:48.710
Obama when he arrived to the White House

182
00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:51.620
he deployed 100,000 soldiers and another

183
00:06:48.71 --> 00:06:53.210
40,000 from NATO even so nothing changed

184
00:06:51.62 --> 00:06:55.490
many experts say that the problem is

185
00:06:53.21 --> 00:06:57.440
that President Obama insisted all the

186
00:06:55.49 --> 00:06:59.419
time on an exit plan with a troop

187
00:06:57.44 --> 00:07:01.100
withdrawal calendar which is sort of

188
00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.539
like saying to the Taliban hey look you

189
00:07:01.1 --> 00:07:04.430
know don't worry about any of this it's

190
00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.990
all temporary but beyond that although

191
00:07:04.43 --> 00:07:07.850
the soldiers from the International

192
00:07:05.99 --> 00:07:10.220
Coalition gained ground they couldn't

193
00:07:07.85 --> 00:07:12.229
gain influence and now the question is

194
00:07:10.22 --> 00:07:14.300
why is that well first of all we're

195
00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.729
talking about a tribal country with a

196
00:07:14.3 --> 00:07:18.380
culture of consolidated violence it's

197
00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.150
not easy for international troops to

198
00:07:18.38 --> 00:07:22.070
gain people's trust and be able to

199
00:07:20.15 --> 00:07:23.930
distinguish civilians from enemies or

200
00:07:22.07 --> 00:07:26.450
even just know what's happening on the

201
00:07:23.93 --> 00:07:28.460
ground the cultural leave is absolutely

202
00:07:26.45 --> 00:07:30.110
huge and having suffered so many years

203
00:07:28.46 --> 00:07:32.330
of violence means that the Taliban

204
00:07:30.11 --> 00:07:34.370
plenty of experience on the other hand

205
00:07:32.33 --> 00:07:36.050
there's the corruption and the lack of

206
00:07:34.37 --> 00:07:37.250
credibility in the local government we

207
00:07:36.05 --> 00:07:38.870
can safely say that the Afghan

208
00:07:37.25 --> 00:07:40.849
government has a total lack of

209
00:07:38.87 --> 00:07:42.800
institutions which can provide anything

210
00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.630
to the Afghan people and while there are

211
00:07:42.8 --> 00:07:47.389
a very few that do exist they are

212
00:07:44.63 --> 00:07:49.030
extremely corrupt in fact this is one of

213
00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:51.560
the most corrupt countries on earth

214
00:07:49.03 --> 00:07:53.389
ordinary Afghans don't like the Taliban

215
00:07:51.56 --> 00:07:55.220
but they dislike the Afghan government

216
00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:57.050
even more people don't die for an army

217
00:07:55.22 --> 00:07:58.580
they die for a country and who wants to

218
00:07:57.05 --> 00:08:01.340
die for the current Afghan government

219
00:07:58.58 --> 00:08:02.870
Dexter Filkins New Yorker reporter with

220
00:08:01.34 --> 00:08:04.490
all of this considered and also adding

221
00:08:02.87 --> 00:08:08.090
in the fear of the Taliban it's easy to

222
00:08:04.49 --> 00:08:09.979
understand why every month almost 4,000

223
00:08:08.09 --> 00:08:11.659
soldiers and policemen deserted the

224
00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:13.580
government of Kabul further we have to

225
00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:14.650
say that the strategy the u.s. has taken

226
00:08:13.58 --> 00:08:17.050
with the Afghan government

227
00:08:14.65 --> 00:08:18.940
the politics and the institutions it

228
00:08:17.05 --> 00:08:20.770
hasn't worked Washington hasn't even

229
00:08:18.94 --> 00:08:22.240
made the Afghan military able to

230
00:08:20.77 --> 00:08:25.000
function with the exception of the

231
00:08:22.24 --> 00:08:26.949
Special Forces which is formed of 17,000

232
00:08:25.0 --> 00:08:28.690
elite soldiers they are the only ones

233
00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:30.699
who are really fighting the Taliban

234
00:08:28.69 --> 00:08:32.289
Barack Obama understood that the war in

235
00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:34.210
Afghanistan was something that the

236
00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:36.039
Afghan people should carry out though

237
00:08:34.21 --> 00:08:37.960
the US would be the one paying the bills

238
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.490
today I signed a historic agreement

239
00:08:37.96 --> 00:08:41.979
between the United States and

240
00:08:39.49 --> 00:08:44.070
Afghanistan that defines a new kind of

241
00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:46.959
relationship between our countries a

242
00:08:44.07 --> 00:08:49.480
future in which Afghans are responsible

243
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:51.279
for the security of their nations among

244
00:08:49.48 --> 00:08:53.410
all the problems we also have to add in

245
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.330
one Pakistan who is being accused of

246
00:08:53.41 --> 00:08:57.730
providing support to the Taliban and to

247
00:08:55.33 --> 00:09:00.010
an economy which doesn't work at all and

248
00:08:57.73 --> 00:09:01.720
then there's three a lot of concealed

249
00:09:00.01 --> 00:09:03.610
interests for example have you thought

250
00:09:01.72 --> 00:09:05.440
about what interests Beijing Tehran or

251
00:09:03.61 --> 00:09:07.209
Moscow having this war one thing is

252
00:09:05.44 --> 00:09:09.279
clear these countries don't want

253
00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:11.320
Afghanistan to be an American colony

254
00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.990
because of all of this after 16 years of

255
00:09:11.32 --> 00:09:15.760
war the battle it continues but now that

256
00:09:13.99 --> 00:09:18.839
the Oval Office is a new President

257
00:09:15.76 --> 00:09:18.839
Donald Trump

258
00:09:22.73 --> 00:09:30.410
a huge mistake Trump has been saying for

259
00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:32.630
years that the war in Afghanistan is a

260
00:09:30.41 --> 00:09:34.699
huge mistake and that the US has to get

261
00:09:32.63 --> 00:09:36.620
out of that he said it of course through

262
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:38.209
his favorite communication medium and

263
00:09:36.62 --> 00:09:43.220
that would be Twitter he repeated it

264
00:09:38.209 --> 00:09:48.560
again and again in 2011 2012 2013 all

265
00:09:43.22 --> 00:09:49.940
the way until his 2016 campaign when

266
00:09:48.56 --> 00:09:51.800
will we stop wasting our money on

267
00:09:49.94 --> 00:09:55.160
rebuilding Afghanistan we must rebuild

268
00:09:51.8 --> 00:09:56.930
our country first it's time to get out

269
00:09:55.16 --> 00:09:58.880
of Afghanistan we're building roads and

270
00:09:56.93 --> 00:10:02.000
schools for people that hate us it's not

271
00:09:58.88 --> 00:10:03.920
in our national interest do not allow

272
00:10:02.0 --> 00:10:05.720
our very stupid leaders to sign a deal

273
00:10:03.92 --> 00:10:09.170
that keeps us in Afghanistan through

274
00:10:05.72 --> 00:10:12.560
2024 with all costs by USA make America

275
00:10:09.17 --> 00:10:14.029
great now Obama is keeping our soldiers

276
00:10:12.56 --> 00:10:16.399
in Afghanistan for at least another year

277
00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:18.380
he is losing two wars simultaneously and

278
00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.449
his noticed Twitter Trump insisted again

279
00:10:18.38 --> 00:10:21.910
and again and again that Afghanistan was

280
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:24.490
a mistake have a look at this

281
00:10:21.91 --> 00:10:27.980
Afghanistan is a total and complete

282
00:10:24.49 --> 00:10:31.040
disaster what are we doing get out of

283
00:10:27.98 --> 00:10:33.500
Afghanistan we've wasted billions and

284
00:10:31.04 --> 00:10:36.500
billions of dollars and more importantly

285
00:10:33.5 --> 00:10:37.880
thousands and thousands of lives and of

286
00:10:36.5 --> 00:10:39.889
course in the presidential campaign he

287
00:10:37.88 --> 00:10:42.470
promised he will get the u.s. out of

288
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:44.600
Afghanistan if elected but well now that

289
00:10:42.47 --> 00:10:46.270
he's president well things they seem to

290
00:10:44.6 --> 00:10:50.069
be rather different

291
00:10:46.27 --> 00:10:54.220
[Music]

292
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:56.199
Trump's new position on the 21st of

293
00:10:54.22 --> 00:10:58.209
August in the military base of Fort Myer

294
00:10:56.199 --> 00:11:00.550
in Virginia Trump explained his brand

295
00:10:58.209 --> 00:11:01.990
new strategy bangs well let's just say

296
00:11:00.55 --> 00:11:04.240
that everything has been saying for

297
00:11:01.99 --> 00:11:06.369
years well it came to nothing Trump's

298
00:11:04.24 --> 00:11:07.749
new strategy is so similar to Obama's

299
00:11:06.369 --> 00:11:09.670
that it's really quite difficult to

300
00:11:07.749 --> 00:11:11.709
differentiate them Trump announced more

301
00:11:09.67 --> 00:11:14.019
troops but not that many more basically

302
00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:16.029
the contingent will increase from 12,000

303
00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:17.559
to about 16,000 the training of the

304
00:11:16.029 --> 00:11:19.509
Afghan military in the fight against

305
00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:21.339
terrorism will become a priority more

306
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:23.019
money will be spent corruption will be

307
00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:25.209
battles and there will be more pressure

308
00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:26.860
on Pakistan so in other words more of

309
00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:28.899
the same and nothing that the US hasn't

310
00:11:26.86 --> 00:11:30.939
done before the main differences from

311
00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:32.740
Obama's strategy though are twofold

312
00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:35.019
first there won't be a withdraw or

313
00:11:32.74 --> 00:11:36.819
calendar and second Trump seems not to

314
00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:38.889
be interested in building Afghan

315
00:11:36.819 --> 00:11:40.480
institutions in fact with the budget

316
00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:42.819
cuts on the State Department Trump seems

317
00:11:40.48 --> 00:11:44.529
to rely more on arms than on politics

318
00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:46.689
and it's not clear what Trump tends to

319
00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:48.160
do with 16,000 soldiers that Obama

320
00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:49.779
couldn't do with a hundred and forty

321
00:11:48.16 --> 00:11:51.730
thousand or how he thinks he can

322
00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:53.679
stabilize a country without solid and

323
00:11:51.73 --> 00:11:55.449
reliable institutions which could gain

324
00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:57.069
local people's trust and allow for some

325
00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:59.139
economic developments I mean the average

326
00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:00.970
age in Afghanistan is around 18 years

327
00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:03.279
old which is an incredibly young

328
00:12:00.97 --> 00:12:05.439
population and this youth nowadays can't

329
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:07.089
work and doesn't have any future apart

330
00:12:05.439 --> 00:12:08.920
from what the Taliban can offer them if

331
00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:10.240
Kabul or Washington are not able to

332
00:12:08.92 --> 00:12:12.790
build a framework of opportunities for

333
00:12:10.24 --> 00:12:16.029
these people the end of violence will be

334
00:12:12.79 --> 00:12:18.309
very far away so the question must be is

335
00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:25.149
Donald Trump aware of this it's going to

336
00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:27.790
be only America first America first so

337
00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:29.829
16 years more than 800 billion dollars

338
00:12:27.79 --> 00:12:31.959
and thousands and thousands of military

339
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:33.910
and civilian losses later and the United

340
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:36.220
States is still bogged down in what many

341
00:12:33.91 --> 00:12:37.839
call the Afghan trap and the truth is

342
00:12:36.22 --> 00:12:39.910
that Trump doesn't seem to propose

343
00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:41.829
anything different without institutions

344
00:12:39.91 --> 00:12:43.689
and without a multilateral willingness

345
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:45.819
which must include Afghanistan's

346
00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:48.309
neighbors like China it seems very hard

347
00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:49.720
to believe that weapons are going to be

348
00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.459
enough and now it's your turn

349
00:12:49.72 --> 00:12:53.170
what do you think the US should do in

350
00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:54.519
Afghanistan it's a pretty big question

351
00:12:53.17 --> 00:12:55.990
you can leave us your opinion in the

352

podcast they provided the vocals in this

358
00:13:03.73 --> 00:13:09.190
episode that were not mine and as always

359
00:13:05.8 --> 00:13:12.279
thank you for watching my original

360
00:13:09.19 --> 00:13:16.480
instant was to pull out and historically

361
00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:19.600
I like following my instincts but all my

362
00:13:16.48 --> 00:13:21.820
life I've heard that decisions are much

363
00:13:19.6 --> 00:13:25.510
different when you sit behind the desk

364
00:13:21.82 --> 00:13:29.550
in the Oval Office in other words when

365
00:13:25.51 --> 00:13:29.550
you're President of the United States
