00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,540
ah sunny California

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,580
a beautiful lands named after a mythical

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,249
Greek islands its nickname is the golden

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:16,470
state a cornucopia that could feed most

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,570
nations majestic beaches that are

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,060
recognizable the whole world over and

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,130
Titanic trees that have stood since the

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,900
reign of Julius Caesar all of these

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,060
wonders can be seen and experienced by

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,280
spending a day driving through this

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,830
lands of nuts and fruits California

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,510
isn't just pretty though it's also

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,989
create Don Rich in 2017 California with

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,390
a population of just 40 million at a GDP

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,699
of almost 3 trillion dollars that's a

17
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,589
couple of hundred million dollars larger

18
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:46,829
than the GDP of India a country with 1.3

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:49,109
billion inhabitants California's real

20
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,539
per-capita GDP is almost sixty nine

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,760
thousand dollars whereas India's is less

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,800
than two thousand dollars this vast

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,539
wealth makes California one of the

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,399
wealthiest places in the world it's the

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,079
sixth largest economy which is about the

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,059
size of France's despite having 26

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,000
million fewer people a free society

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,930
populated by some of the wealthiest

29
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,270
people in human history built upon an

Eden Eska landscape what a place to be

31
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,290
however you may have noticed that this

32
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,360
sounds too good to be true and if you

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,369
didn't you may be surprised to hear news

34
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,350
like this that comes out of the state

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,220
every few years

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,620
laughs for Nia's budget deficit is back

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,770
Governor Jerry Brown says Elliott times

38
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,440
2017 less than four years after

39
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,720
declaring California's budget balanced

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,220
for the foreseeable future

41
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,350
Governor Jerry Brown on Tuesday said the

42
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,110
state is projected to run a 1.6 billion

43
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,040
dollar deficit by next summer Stockton

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,320
California to become largest city to

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,850
declare bankruptcy

46
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,790
CBS 2012 now this news is a couple of

47
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,950
years old and actually California runs a

48
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,110
pretty healthy surplus at the time of

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,970
this writing but that's not what's

50
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,500
important here even if the state's

51
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,440
finances are fine now they won't be for

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,510
long California cycles through fiscal

53
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,820
crises semi-regularly so how can it be

54
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,070
that in a state with high taxes taxing

55
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,869
some of the wealthiest people in the

56
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,850
world it is so often struggling to pay

57
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,040
its bills other questions are well is

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,810
there a solution and how does this

59
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,880
affect the daily life of Californians

60
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,530
well today we're going to answer all of

61
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,690
these questions but before we do let's

62
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,150
take a look back at the history

63
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,270
[Music]

64
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,550
california's financial thought lives so

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,440
where do we start when dealing with such

66
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,840
a big problem well let's try taxes and

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,300
spending California spends a lot of

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,400
money often more than it takes in which

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,920
is what this video is about obviously

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,250
but how much money is that the 2019 2020

71
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,760
state budget was a whopping 209 billion

72
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,350
dollars which is bigger than the entire

73
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,700
GDP of Greece

74
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,190
[Music]

75
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,710
that's not all this is even high for

76
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,480
California standards because they won't

77
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,610
stop spending more and more money the

78
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,210
2008 to 2009 budget was 144 billion or

79
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,670
so large but still 50 billion dollars

80
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,160
cheaper however back then this was also

81
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,750
high for California and if you went all

82
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,550
the way back to 1990 the budget was

83
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,460
after factoring in inflation a hundred 1

84
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,280
billion dollars in 2019 money that's

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,870
right the State of California's budget

86
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,480
has doubled in real terms over the last

87
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,780
30 years so that is the money go well it

88
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,460
goes a lot of places for example the

89
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,170
state has been trying to build an 80

90
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,820
billion dollar high-speed rail network

91
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,010
from LA through the Central Valley

92
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,980
though the price keeps increasing

93
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,970
[Music]

94
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,190
more wholesome example is that from 2018

95
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,860
to 2019 California spent almost five

96
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,510
billion dollars on Health and Human

97
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,820
Services 3.8 billion dollars of which

98
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,440
went to the Department of Child Services

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
which is a state program to get publicly

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,250
assisted health care for Sick Children

101
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,510
and just under two hundred million

102
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,040
dollars went to the Department of Aging

103
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,930
which provides welfare services for the

104
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,210
elderly meanwhile Texas estate with just

105
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,980
10 million fewer people spent zero

106
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,140
dollars on such things with the only

107
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,420
real funding on health issues going to

108
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,430
hospitals and to the elderly for

109
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,320
pensions both of which things that

110
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,080
California does on a larger scale now I

111
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,730
don't know about you but I know that a

112
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,560
lot of people would rather pay a Texas

113
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,600
tax rate rather than a california tax

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,850
rate however isn't tax money going to

115
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,830
help sick children and elderly people

116
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,990
exactly the kind of stuff that taxes are

117
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,030
intended for so I mean what's the

118
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,410
problem here the problem is that the

119
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,660
state has struggled to keep up revenue

120
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,680
to pay for these services

121
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,970
now this might sound bad

122
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,230
normally when we think of regular

123
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,180
financial crises we think of Greece or

124
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,430
Argentina but California is the golden

125
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,290
state so let's say you're a California

126
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,760
maybe you work as a coder for Googler or

127
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,350
an economist for Monsanto or an oil

128
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,660
refinery worker for Chevron so what does

129
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,860
it matter to you if the local government

130
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,920
owes a few billion dollars well probably

131
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,900
not a whole lot in fact it would be

132
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,150
surprising if half the citizens of well

133
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,950
anywhere really knew these specifics

134
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,660
about their local government spending

135
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,490
habits the difference between California

136
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,620
and those two economic cragmire is that

137
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,300
California actually has business

138
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,310
world-class universities a thriving

139
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,500
agricultural industry and Hollywood plus

140
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,660
a booming culture of venture capitalism

141
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,370
in other words their economy is

142
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,530
extremely diversified this all means

143
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,300
that California can withstand the

144
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,820
occasional shortcoming because it's just

145
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,400
that good so again where's the problem

146
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680
well let's start with taxes we know the

147
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,910
government started spending money like

148
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,740
crazy almost always for things like

149
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,990
welfare pensions and it terminally

150
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,550
cramped prisons and they managed to pay

151
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,440
for enough of it to keep going so all

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,490
where's the money coming from

153
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,410
well of course it all comes from taxes

154
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,479
and California has some really high

155
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,340
taxes

156
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,940
[Music]

157
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,260
for example California has the highest

158
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,870
maximum income tax rate of any state of

159
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,390
a 13% for comparison the state with the

160
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,610
next highest tax rate is Hawaii with 11%

161
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,560
more over the next two most populous

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,900
states Texas and Florida have no income

163
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,180
tax whatsoever along with five other

164
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,070
states it's not just income taxes either

165
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,900
high property taxes high capital gains

166
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,880
taxes and high corporate tax all

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,380
factored in it doesn't have a very high

168
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,480
sales tax especially by European

169
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,640
standards but that one's still the 10th

170
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,500
highest in the Union now that you know

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,120
where that 200 billion dollars is coming

172
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,340
from we still go back to okay so we saw

173
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,110
the highest taxes on the global uber

174
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,120
wealthy and corporations how is it that

175
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,920
they're still struggling with funding

176
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
well the issue is that the high taxes

177
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,550
corporate income property in capital

178
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,410
gains of which California is highly

179
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,840
dependent all affect the rich the most

180
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
is actually a proper progressive tax

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,800
system in fact in 2004 it was estimated

182
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,930
that the wealthiest 3 percent of revenue

183
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,450
made up 60% of tax revenue from income

184
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:55,050
tax however this comes with a major

185
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,790
issue you see when the national and

186
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,860
global economy is doing well like now

187
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,780
the state rakes in tons of tax money

188
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,790
from all the mega Corpse and venture

189
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,830
capitalists and things like that when

190
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,720
things go poorly when the stock market

191
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,790
goes down investments are risky and

192
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,770
companies have lower returns and this

193
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,020
means the revenue plummets faster than a

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,910
Hong Kong rights activist under

195
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,190
suspicious circumstances other high tax

196
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,200
societies don't really have this issue

197
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
of instability to the same level as

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,190
California Sweden which also has

199
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,350
remarkably high taxes is less prone to

200
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:32,490
fluctuation why because they have a more

201
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,560
diversified tax system as an example

202
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,230
they do have a 25% sales tax this is

203
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,910
three times higher in California such

204
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,220
tax policies are considered regressive

205
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,440
because both rich and poor pay the same

206
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,700
but they do have an advantage

207
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,950
consumption that fluctuates much more

208
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,050
than investments after all no matter how

209
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,000
good or bad the stock market does you

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,980
tend to go grocery shopping every week

211
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,350
and on holidays buy lots of stuff so the

212
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,000
sales tax collection is much more

213
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,520
reliable so aside from just being really

214
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,100
high California's taxes fluctuate a lot

215
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,580
year after year so does it pay off is

216
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,470
is very progressive tax system in which

217
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,960
the rich pay higher dues worth it's even

218
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,180
if it fluctuates as the Titanic welfare

219
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,039
state in support succeed it is

220
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,719
California a proper progressive

221
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:17,030
economically egalitarian society is it

222
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,770
really more equal well not really

223
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,199
[Music]

224
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,479
homeless nation California is not just

225
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,550
unequal it's incredibly unequal

226
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,650
California has the fourth highest income

227
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,599
equality of the 50 states which is

228
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,360
almost as bad as Louisiana at number 3 7

229
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,880
of America's 15 most unequal cities call

230
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,649
the Golden State home and it's not

231
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:40,669
getting any better

232
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,170
subsequently we get news like this

233
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,800
Blaz homelessness surged 75% in six

234
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,930
years the number of those living in the

235
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,639
streets and shelters of the city of Los

236
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,639
Angeles and most of the county searched

237
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,420
75% to roughly 55,000 from about 32,000

238
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,940
in the last six years now inequality

239
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,740
alone didn't cause this urban

240
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,690
populations have continued to grow and

241
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,639
economic peculiarities like those

242
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,290
mentioned in another video we did about

243
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,000
the case of Airbnb have led to a

244
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,070
disastrously high cost of living in the

245
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,959
state with high housing costs being a

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,209
major contributor in March 2019 the

247
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,070
national median rent for a two-bedroom

248
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,540
apartment was one thousand one hundred

249
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,370
and seventy five dollars in Los Angeles

250
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,959
it's one thousand seven hundred and

251
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:24,709
fifty two dollars

252
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,860
san Diego's 2030 San Francisco three

253
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,810
thousand one hundred and sixty-five

254
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,430
dollars but it doesn't stop there

255
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,470
California also has other high costs

256
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,420
like above-average food prices and the

257
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,949
highest transportation costs in the

258
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,899
country now throw on those notoriously

259
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,720
high taxes when the system's strained is

260
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,430
a bit of an understatement a cheap labor

261
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,529
force imported from Latin America has

262
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,180
helped keep wages down in the tech

263
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,130
bourgeoisie pushing up prices has only

264
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,019
contributed further to the growing

265
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,319
inequality from 1980 to 2015 inflation

266
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:56,750
adjusted wages rose 18% for the bottom

267
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,310
10 percent of the workforce whereas the

268
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,949
top 5% experienced a wage increase of a

269
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,630
hundred and twenty two percent this

270
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,490
means someone who made fifteen thousand

271
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,500
a year in 1980 would now make seventeen

272
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
thousand seven hundred whereas someone

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,470
who made a hundred thousand would now

274
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,830
make two hundred and twenty-two thousand

275
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,450
now throw in some other situational

276
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,190
factors like nice weather attracting the

277
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,050
homeless from less hospitable states and

278
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,940
strict zoning laws keeping new housing

279
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,860
from being built us a national mental

280
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,690
health crisis and yo the recipe to

281
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,880
develop parallel societies one made up

282
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
of impoverished fentanyl zombies living

283
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,540
in tent communes and the other the

284
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,220
world's elite so what's being done about

285
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,010
all of this well nothing I mean really

286
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,020
nothing their response from local

287
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,399
governments and their Democratic super

288
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,890
majorities has been deafeningly silent

289
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,720
many local city governments Oakland for

290
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,399
instance offer short-term housing for

291
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,140
some homeless people who essentially win

292
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,149
the lottery to get it at only last six

293
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,740
months and then they're back on the

294
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,330
street essentially they just kick the

295
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,160
homeless over to the next town creating

296
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,140
cyclical waves of homeless hordes

297
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,209
passing through each region like a dog

298
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:01,670
chasing its own tail in frosty New York

299
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,920
about 95 percent of transients receive

300
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,050
sheltering in Seattle it's almost 60

301
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,970
percent San Francisco is under 40

302
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,190
percent and San Luis Obispo is below 20

303
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,649
so where is all that tax money going

304
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,450
instead of sheltering the poor well in

305
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,209
one example in 2016 the city of La sent

306
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,470
out their police who are of course

307
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,720
funded by taxpayer money to confiscate

308
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,180
tiny shelters donated to the homeless by

309
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,490
a private charity yes really they pay

310
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,709
police to steal donated shelters from

311
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:29,660
the homeless and probably throw them in

312
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,550
an incinerator somewhere meanwhile the

313
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,050
state needs to about 3 million new

314
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,940
dwellings to cover demand and what's the

315
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,070
outcome of all of this well it's not so

316
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,080
sunny

317
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,100

319
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,870
the Golden State but it's lost its

320
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,880
glitter the fluctuating budgets high

321
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,950

have led to increased numbers of rats

329
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,680
and along with them fleas and deadly

330
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,529
diseases there were 13 reported cases of

331

336
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,459
yes really the plague is actually back

337
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,079
the more things change the more they

338
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,000
stay the same this issue of mass

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,829
homelessness is leading to sanitation

340
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,720
issues as camps spring earth under

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,329
bridges and in parks with no regulation

342
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,490
and no sanitation infrastructure now if

343
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,320
they're in some natural pests and a drug

344
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,060

making as you can imagine Californians

346
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,839
aren't the happiest in fact many are

347
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,180
very very angry at society and the seeds

348
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,040
of radicalism are watered with misery

349
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,990
this is a complicated issue probably

350
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,000
worth its own video but here are just

351
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,589

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,529
American liberalism at becoming a

372
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,599
breeding grounds for radical ism so I've

373
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,579
painted a pretty dour picture right I'll

374
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,199
now throw in some environmental issues

375
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:49,729
that we don't have time for like high

376
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,799
urban pollution out-of-control wildfires

377
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,989
and invasive species and well what do

378
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:55,189
you think most people are doing

379
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,899
if you answered building a giant gold

380
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,399
statue of arnold schwarzenegger he

381
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,289
answered wrong if you said getting out

382
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:03,199
of there fast he wants it right in 2018

383
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,449
almost 700 Californians left California

384
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,999
yep people are really leaving in droves

385
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,220
for other states like Idaho Texas

386
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,649
Colorado Oklahoma and Nevada where they

387
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,509
have lower costs of living lower taxes

388
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:16,099
and stronger wage growth yes

389
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,899
congratulations you now live in a time

390
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,849
line where people are leaving California

391
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,589
to go to Oklahoma but wait you say

392
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,659
California's population is increasing

393
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,649
Simon what's all that about

394
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,809
well you see where is 690 thousand

395
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,209
Californians laugh 500,000 people moved

396
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,189
in from other states but that's still a

397
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:34,279
net 190,000 loss so how are there more

398
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,879
people in California in 2019 than 2015

399
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,619
well it's international immigration

400
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,259
rather than internal migration you see

401
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:44,539
though there was a net loss of 190,000

402
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:46,549
americans leaving california every day

403
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,009
if not our the state receives thousands

404
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:50,569
of immigrants from places like Mexico

405
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:53,089
Nigeria Guatemala the Philippines in

406
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,649
Eastern Europe so many that it offsets

407
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,839
the locals leaving and so the population

408
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,429
continues to increase despite the

409
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,139
state's problems it's still preferable

410
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,179
to Guatemala and we can't say we're too

411
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,739
surprised there so now I'll turn it over

412
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,119
to you what do you think will happen

413
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:07,429
next is this just a phase in the state's

414
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:09,559
young history well the state stabilized

415
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,180
its budget and spend its

416
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,920
