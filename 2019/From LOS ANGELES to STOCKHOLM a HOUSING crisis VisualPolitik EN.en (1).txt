00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,720
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,880
I'm sure you've had the discussion with

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,130
your friends at some point why are flats

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,530
getting so expensive it doesn't matter

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,390
if you live in Los Angeles San Francisco

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,390
or London we're talking about a really

7
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,890
global problem then again we should

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,780
first question is this actually a

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,700
problem at all or is it just you know

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,620
basic economics

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,740
[Music]

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,630
whatever it is we're talking about a

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,489
phenomenon that's happening in all the

14
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,680
big metropolis for example in the city

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,239
of Los Angeles the average rent has

16
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,190
risen 15% in the last three years and

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,750
let's be honest here if you have a

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,390
decent salary this is really more of an

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,430
inconvenience than it is a real problem

20
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,379
but let's imagine that you're a shop

21
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,420
assistants in a lie even better let's

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,220
imagine that Xander is a shop assistant

23
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,190
in LA what what happens here Xander if I

24
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,199
were a shop assistant in Los Angeles I

25
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,930
would probably be making around $2,000 a

26
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,479
month 540 square foot studio apartment

27
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,179
in South LA which is a very cheap

28
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,729
neighborhood can cost about $1,200 a

29
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,660
month

30
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,179
this would mean that 60% of my pre-tax

31
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:16,300
salary would go to rent the rest would

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,369
go to basic needs like food and clothing

33
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,550
so yes I would have a hard time saving

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,289
money with that salary now in an ideal

35
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,060
situation you would only spend about 1/3

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,830
of your salary on your rent or mortgage

37
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,319
so you'd have enough to live comfortably

38
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,920
and to save some money spending 60% of

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,960
your income on rent means that just a

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,960
small increase in prices could knock you

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,149
below the poverty line and yes that risk

42
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,610
is a lot more real than you might want

43
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,370
to believe

44
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,160
Los Angeles homeless population hits

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,650
36,000 in dramatic rise but this is not

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,700
the end of the story

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,290
I mean think about this here a visual

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,940
politic we always say that the world is

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,690
getting bigger

50
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,430
we're wealthier we're healthier and we

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,650
have better lifestyles this is partly

52
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,390
because stuff is actually getting

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,220
cheaper here's an example during the

54
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,410
nineteen seventies only 20% of Americans

55
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,480
had ever flown on a plane why well

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,730
because between Los Angeles and New York

57
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,090
the trip would cost you 1500 of today's

58
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,250
dollars now this very same flight it

59
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,560
only costs 200 thanks to this I'm sure

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,210
most of you watching have already

61
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,010
traveled more than your grandparents did

62
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,620
in their entire lifetimes the same goes

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,360
for other goods everything is becoming

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,690
more and more affordable except houses

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,090
no matter if you rent or if you buy you

66
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,490
have to make the same if not more

67
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,630
sacrifices than your grandparents

68
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,670
generation did in stock on there are

69
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,290
people living in a hundred and fifty

70
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,030
square feet flats in fact it's not

71
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,800
uncommon to meet couples in Sweden who

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,180
want to divorce but are waiting for

73
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,860
their spouse to find another flat but

74
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,230
the real question here is why our flat

75
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,990
rentals going so sky-high can we solve

76
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,240
this problem with better policies well

77
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,170
today we're going to answer these

78
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,240
questions but before we do let's take a

79
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,820
look back at the history reply demand

80
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,300
and the rest it is a universal and

81
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,550
logical facts the population grows in

82
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,500
every country just a decade ago America

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,260
at 300 million people now they have 27

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,800
million more but not all cities grow

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,240
equally if you're watching this video

86
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,070
from Detroit or Cleveland's you've

87
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,810
probably noticed that there are less and

88
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,670
less people around most of your friends

89
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,890
they're leaving the city and where are

90
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,580
they going

91
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,920
yep they're going to cities like LA on

92
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,380
New York so what does that mean it means

93
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,820
that the demands for living in those

94
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,560
cities keeps getting higher this is

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,530
totally ok and it is natural but here is

96
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,030
the real problem if we're talking about

97
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,820
a normal market supply it can rise to

98
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,700
satisfy that demand for an example let's

99
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,110
look at oil markets we've told you a

100
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,730
million times here a visual politic how

101
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,010
Saudi Arabia decreases or increases its

102
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,320
oil barrel production depending on the

103
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,780
markets needs it's easy they can

104
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,610
increase production from one month to

105
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,080
the other but when it comes to real

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,150
estate increasing supply means building

107
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,250
more houses and this takes time

108
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,200
besides the investment for a new block

109
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,360
of flats is huge and the profit margins

110
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,730
are around 3% and the truth is that we

111
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,050
need many many houses to cover to marked

112
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,700
California would need to build 3.5

113
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,100
million housing units by 2025 to close

114
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,440
its housing gap extract from a report

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,660
from McKinsey Global Institute October

116
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,120
2016 but why do developers have so many

117
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,860
problems building homes I mean we're

118
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,300
talking basic economics area it would

119
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
seem that if you entered the housing

120
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,030
building industry

121
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,830
you'd do pretty well in California well

122
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,090
of course you would but there's one

123
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,310
problem and that zoning laws you see the

124
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,840
real estate market is actually tightly

125
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,820
regulated by City Hall if you want to

126
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,830
build in LA you need a permit that can

127
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,720
take more than three years to get and

128
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,010
all of this happens because city

129
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,810
corporations are the ones who choose

130
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,870
where and how to build so how does City

131
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,060
Hall know how many dwellings they need

132
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,830
well mainly they look at population

133
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,570
growth if you check the data you'll see

134
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,580
that the housing centers in LA has

135
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,740
mirrored its demographic growth and

136
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,360
although it makes sense on the surface

137
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,220
this is a huge mistake because

138
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,560
population is one thing demand is

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,550
another

140
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,530
for example imagine a couple who lives

141
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,750
in one house if they get divorced all of

142
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,490
a sudden they need an extra house so

143
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,680
well there you go same population but we

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,690
just created twice as much demand and

145
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,580
the reality is that we have a higher and

146
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,889
higher single and divorce population

147
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,690
this is not happening just in Los

148
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,699
Angeles but also in Madrid in Berlin and

149
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,160
almost every other city many experts say

150
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,960
that the solution is to build more

151
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,180
houses mother's advocate for abolishing

152
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,669
zoning laws but in Europe many cities

153
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:45,099
that on price controls so do you think

154
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,110
these policies are working is it a good

155
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,090
or is it a bad idea well have a look

156
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:56,380
shall we the other Stockholm Syndrome

157
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,330
usually when we talk about Sweden is

158
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,620
because we're using them as a model

159
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,479
Swedish people enjoy a large welfare

160
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,490
state alongside a dynamic economy with

161
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,380
innovative companies among those is

162
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,300
Europe's most famous startup even though

163
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,949
it might not stand Sweden for that much

164
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:14,259
longer check this out Spotify threats to

165
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,240
leave Sweden's first startup protests

166
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,889
and Stockholm and as for you might be

167
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,180
thinking what come on Simon everyone

168
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,830
knows that Sweden is pretty open to

169
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,620
immigrants and well yes they are but

170
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,180
good luck moving to Stockholm and

171
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,130
finding a flat while we were making this

172
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,870
video actually spoke to a man who worked

173
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,430
for a Swedish startup for a year and a

174
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,409
half he made a salary of two thousand

175
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,880
nine hundred euros a month but more than

176
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,310
a half of that went towards paying rent

177
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,590
on a five hundred square foot flat and

178
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,750
believe me this was not the worst case

179
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,969
finding a flat in Stockholm is so hard

180
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,979
that some people spend months in an air

181
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,020
B&B as a now you might be wondering well

182
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,730
why

183
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,220
okay so it all started in the 1950s

184
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,500
Sweden needed houses so the Social

185
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,390
Democratic government created the

186
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,340
million houses policy the idea was to

187
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,200
build public houses for rent at very

188
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,940
cheap prices during those early years

189
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,740
every Swedish person could apply for a

190
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,630
public house and pay rent at prices

191
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,250
equivalent to four hundred or three

192
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,200
hundred euros today but things changed

193
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,020
in the 1990s

194
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,210
during those years Sweden suffered one

195
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,250
of the worst debt crises in their

196
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,979
history no money no more houses but the

197
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:23,050
rent regulations they still remained so

198
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,759
either you went for a public house or

199
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,770
you had to find a place in an extremely

200
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,470
scarce rental market basically in Sweden

201
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,120
they have the so called first hands

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,480
market those are the public houses

203
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,980
[Music]

204
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,170
if you're swedish the first thing you do

205
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,270
when you turn 18 is to apply there if

206
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,450
you're lucky in 13 or 16 years there's a

207
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,220
two-bedroom apartment waiting for you

208
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,050
for just 600 euros a month

209
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,730
in other words but you don't pay with

210
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:52,350
money you pay with time

211
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,560
this explains why 25% of the Swedes stay

212
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,230
with their parents until they turn 30

213
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,540
and it also explains why this society is

214
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,940
turning from renting to owning with

215
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,860
lower rates for mortgages most Swedes

216
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,720
buy as soon as they can but the real

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,580
question is what happens to people who

218
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,350
weren't born in Sweden what happens if

219
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,910
you just move there and have no family

220
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,250
to stay with well in that case welcome

221
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,020
to the wonderful world of these

222
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,450
secondhand market basically Sweden

223
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,740
believes that you shouldn't make money

224
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,700
from renting

225
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,070
the law has lots of ways to ban people

226
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,080
from renting and long-term rentals are

227
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,640
forbidden but even if you had a tenant

228
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,470
for a one-year contract the community of

229
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,760
your building can deny you permission

230
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,860
yep yeah that right your neighbors can

231
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,240
essentially say that you can't rent your

232
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,040
place out or you have to kick out your

233
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,930
tenants this explains why with so many

234
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,520
restrictions there are almost no

235
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,500
available flats so despite the great

236
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,720
welfare system many people live in 200

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,760
square feet flats but again the worst

238
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,280
problem is not the inconvenience it's

239
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,960
this we improved right in mainly

240
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,420
immigrant Stockholm suburb exactly the

241
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,280
poor immigrants have no capital to find

242
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,110
a flat and they have to go to the worst

243
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,750
neighborhoods then this is how ghettos

244
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,940
form and yes yes okay I know you've all

245
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,890
seen those conspiracy videos where they

246
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,990
exaggerate the gang violence in Sweden

247
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,430
but let's be honest even though the

248
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,380
problem is not as big as some media

249
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,870
portrays Sweden does have a clear

250
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,760
problem with criminality but we'll talk

251
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,470
about this in a future video in the

252
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,730
meantime if you're enjoying this video

253
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,290

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,460
nice but let's get back to our story of

259
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,260
course this Stockholm crisis could be

260
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,690
solved by building more houses but even

261
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,940
if you built 80,000 new dwellings a year

262
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,070
as many have suggested could also badly

263
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,710
need to change those renting laws so now

264
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,940
you are you're thinking all right Simon

265
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,650
well now we've been waiting it's time

266
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,060
for you to tell us the magical solution

267
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,700
is there any example of a city that has

268
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,590
solved this renting problem and the

269
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,140
answer is yes let's check it out shall

270
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,630
we

271
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,590
[Music]

272
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,020
Vienna and rent for all system Austria

273
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,850
is one of Europe's wealthiest countries

274
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,800
the average salary here is over two

275
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
thousand seven hundred euros a month and

276
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,460
if you live in Vienna it's not hard to

277
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,890
find jobs that are paying more than 3500

278
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,960
euros a month nevertheless rent costs

279
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,450
are the same as a way poorer city like

280
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,510
Madrid Spain for 1500 euros you can find

281
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,060
an amazing 860 square foot flat in the

282
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,650
center of the city I know you're

283
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,240
thinking are come on out guys official

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,740
politicking gonna tell me another story

285
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,270
about how a city embraced the free

286
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,000
market with no remorse and lived happily

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
ever after right well no actually the

288
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,900
opposite is true

289
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,580
basically the Vienna Council is

290
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,290
something like a developer and a rental

291
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,300
agency at the same time they are the

292
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,090
city's biggest landlord you see after

293
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,770
world war 2 heart of vienna ended up

294
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,900
completely devastated by the bombing so

295
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,090
the city hall paid for all of the

296
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,890
reconstruction that's when they said

297
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,820
hold on a minute

298
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,530
since we pay for all this are we inside

299
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,120
it's also rented out under our own

300
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,130
conditions and this is how the world's

301
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,560
most ambitious public program started

302
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,520
here's how it works

303
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,040
80% of people in Vienna live in rental

304
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,110
flats 60% of those live in public

305
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,000
housing some of the buildings are from

306
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,740
cooperatives and others belong to City

307
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,120
Hall but hold on a minute

308
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
because we're not talking about normal

309
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
rental agreements yet in fact we could

310
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,950
call them something just short of

311
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,990
limited property basically rent

312
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,910
contracts in Vienna they last forever

313
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,980
even if you're dead yeah rental

314
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,380
contracts can be inherited so long as

315
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,630
you don't move you can stay and the flat

316
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,660
is yours ends well you should see these

317
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,030
houses in America in the UK we have this

318
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,650
notion that public housing is for the

319
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,940
poor and that is in bad neighborhoods

320
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,430
but here you can find public houses even

321
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,350
in the best neighborhoods and they're

322
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,030
pretty amazing the swimming pools gyms

323
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,040
even saunas

324
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,380
[Music]

325
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,790
[Applause]

326
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,590
in some cases it gets really absurd

327
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,120
while we're doing the research for this

328
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,980
video we spoke to Vienna City Hall and

329
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,750
they gave us a lot of cases for example

330
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,220
there's a young woman who lives in an

331
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,380
860 square foot apartment in the city

332
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,390
center and she thinks she pays for it

333
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,760
well yep only 400 euros a month that's

334
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,890
less than 500 dollars but a neighbor

335
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,140
living in a similar flat plays 2,000

336
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,390
euros why well he lives in one the

337
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,430
apartments that aren't public so just

338
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,980
like in Stockholm Vienna has two types

339
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,200
of renting control prices and free

340
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,910
prices and so now you might be wondering

341
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,740
well how come they don't have waiting

342
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,930
lists well here's your answer

343
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,170
[Music]

344
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,910
annually vienna spends about 600 million

345
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,029
euros or 682 million dollars on social

346
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,760
housing in comparison germany with a

347
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,610
population over 45 times Vienna

348
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,769
spends about 400 million euros

349
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,750
nationwide so you gotta be wondering now

350
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,550
well how does the system work let's say

351
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,990
you moved to Vienna in the first few

352
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,639
years you can't apply for public housing

353
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,260
but no problem there are more than two

354
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,880
hundred and ninety thousand flats on the

355
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,860
free market so it's not that hard to

356
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,660
find a place and the prices aren't crazy

357
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,399
because there's a large supply then

358
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,110
after only two or three years you can

359
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,120
apply for a public house depending on

360
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,190
your family status your income and your

361
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,139
pickiness it might be easier or harder

362
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,880
for you to find a home usually we're

363
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,350
talking about waiting times of no more

364
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,120
than two years of course as we always

365
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,860
say on visual politic not everything is

366
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,850
sunshine and rainbows

367
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,500
the first issue with this system is that

368
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,180
you don't want to move out of your flat

369
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,130
once you find it this model pretty much

370
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,110
reduces your freedom to choose basically

371
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,910
it's not you gets to choose that rather

372
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,920
City Hall and remember the your house

373
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,240
determines many things about your

374
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,620
lifestyle but there is another issue

375
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,450
here that sustainability

376
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,180
[Music]

377
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,760
this system relies heavily on just one

378
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,890
actor the Municipal Corporation this

379
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,180
means that as long as the local

380
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,860
government is the money there's no

381
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,320
problem but they just need one crisis

382
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,180
and there will be no more houses and

383
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,110
since there aren't many private

384
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,580
developers because there are no

385
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,590
incentives they could easily end up with

386
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,780
a housing shortage situation and this

387
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,300
would lead to a lot of problems but we

388
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,430
do have to admit that so far this model

389
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,890
does seem to be working so the question

390
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,120
now of course becomes would it be

391
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,310
possible to combine the Vienna model

392
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,680
with a more free market solution do you

393
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,060
think this system could be applied in

394
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,830
other cities as well would you mind

395
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,480
renting the same flat for your entire

396
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,370
life if the conditions were good enough

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,260
