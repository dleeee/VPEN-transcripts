2
00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.580
unless you are watching this video from

3
00:00:09.3 --> 00:00:14.120
Syria it's fair to say that no matter

4
00:00:11.58 --> 00:00:18.449
how bad the situation in your country

5
00:00:14.12 --> 00:00:21.330
Venezuela is doing worse as of 2015 they

6
00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.480
are experiencing more inflation than any

7
00:00:21.33 --> 00:00:26.010
other country in the entire world

8
00:00:23.48 --> 00:00:28.410
furthermore their capital Caracas is

9
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:30.570
currently ranked as being the world's

10
00:00:28.41 --> 00:00:33.329
most violent city beating out other

11
00:00:30.57 --> 00:00:38.340
famously violent cities in both Mexico

12
00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.260
and Colombia something as simple as

13
00:00:38.34 --> 00:00:42.899
buying toilet paper has also become

14
00:00:40.26 --> 00:00:45.270
practically impossible in Venezuela and

15
00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.010
scarcity has become a norm in

16
00:00:45.27 --> 00:00:49.050
supermarkets other products such as

17
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:51.329
condoms have to be bought and sold on

18
00:00:49.05 --> 00:00:53.039
the black market and all of this is

19
00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.280
happening in a country with the world's

20
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.050
largest oil reserves in fact it wasn't

21
00:00:56.28 --> 00:00:59.940
so long ago that Venezuela was the

22
00:00:58.05 --> 00:01:02.219
richest country in the whole of South

23
00:00:59.94 --> 00:01:05.010
America but today over half their

24
00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.900
population lives in poverty so the big

25
00:01:05.01 --> 00:01:08.880
question is how did they end up there

26
00:01:06.9 --> 00:01:10.920
how did the government destroy the

27
00:01:08.88 --> 00:01:15.350
economy in such a short amount of time

28
00:01:10.92 --> 00:01:15.350
today we're gonna tell you that story

29
00:01:15.69 --> 00:01:20.230
there will be variant revolution the

30
00:01:18.49 --> 00:01:22.240
first character in our story is Hugo

31
00:01:20.23 --> 00:01:24.160
Chavez the father of modern-day

32
00:01:22.24 --> 00:01:26.290
Venezuela or should we say the

33
00:01:24.16 --> 00:01:28.270
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela he

34
00:01:26.29 --> 00:01:32.290
became president after a landslide

35
00:01:28.27 --> 00:01:34.720
victory in 1999 his campaign was based

36
00:01:32.29 --> 00:01:37.990
on the promise of equality and poverty

37
00:01:34.72 --> 00:01:40.090
reduction a policy that he called 21st

38
00:01:37.99 --> 00:01:41.920
century socialism one of his first

39
00:01:40.09 --> 00:01:44.560
policies was called the system for the

40
00:01:41.92 --> 00:01:47.380
democratization of jobs this was meant

41
00:01:44.56 --> 00:01:49.690
to be implemented in the pdvsa the state

42
00:01:47.38 --> 00:01:51.700
company that extracts Venezuela's oil

43
00:01:49.69 --> 00:01:53.740
and don't forget now that we're talking

44
00:01:51.7 --> 00:02:02.110
about a country that has bigger oil

45
00:01:53.74 --> 00:02:04.540
reserves than Saudi Arabia dvb-s a spy

46
00:02:02.11 --> 00:02:06.520
role has more than doubled to a hundred

47
00:02:04.54 --> 00:02:10.000
and fifteen thousand employees since

48
00:02:06.52 --> 00:02:13.630
Chavez took office in 1999 and that has

49
00:02:10.0 --> 00:02:15.940
recent tenfold since 2006 234 billion

50
00:02:13.63 --> 00:02:18.370
u.s. dollars this was pretty big news

51
00:02:15.94 --> 00:02:20.170
considering the PDVSA is the largest

52
00:02:18.37 --> 00:02:23.050
company in South America nevertheless

53
00:02:20.17 --> 00:02:25.239
Venezuela kept producing the same number

54
00:02:23.05 --> 00:02:27.220
of barrels per year this means that the

55
00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.560
staff increase had nothing to do with

56
00:02:27.22 --> 00:02:29.950
corporate reasons but rather political

57
00:02:29.56 --> 00:02:32.709
ones

58
00:02:29.95 --> 00:02:35.020
in fact this job democratization was a

59
00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.180
way to employ all of the unemployed

60
00:02:35.02 --> 00:02:38.739
Venezuelans the same thing happened in

61
00:02:37.18 --> 00:02:41.530
the government during the Chavez's

62
00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.170
administration public spending tripled

63
00:02:41.53 --> 00:02:45.910
[Music]

64
00:02:43.17 --> 00:02:48.790
this meant more government workers and

65
00:02:45.91 --> 00:02:50.380
more social programs of an ever before

66
00:02:48.79 --> 00:02:52.930
however none of this was a problem as

67
00:02:50.38 --> 00:02:53.560
long as the oil exports kept paying the

68
00:02:52.93 --> 00:02:55.330
bills

69
00:02:53.56 --> 00:02:57.790
in fact Chavez cut poverty in half

70
00:02:55.33 --> 00:03:00.340
despite being an oil-rich country before

71
00:02:57.79 --> 00:03:03.250
Shabbos 60% of the population lived in

72
00:03:00.34 --> 00:03:05.260
poverty ten years after Shabbos only 30%

73
00:03:03.25 --> 00:03:07.150
did despite a versus rhetoric that

74
00:03:05.26 --> 00:03:09.430
capitalist countries were trying to

75
00:03:07.15 --> 00:03:11.710
destroy the revolution no one would

76
00:03:09.43 --> 00:03:14.020
reject Venezuela's oil even Nicolas

77
00:03:11.71 --> 00:03:15.820
Sarkozy france's conservative presidents

78
00:03:14.02 --> 00:03:20.410
over the time was complementing

79
00:03:15.82 --> 00:03:23.020
Venezuela's democracy I'm glad about

80
00:03:20.41 --> 00:03:25.960
Venezuelan elections with their strong

81
00:03:23.02 --> 00:03:29.140
turnout the Tros once again the vitality

82
00:03:25.96 --> 00:03:31.630
of democracy in Venezuela - all of these

83
00:03:29.14 --> 00:03:35.670
policies we must add the famous fair

84
00:03:31.63 --> 00:03:38.890
obviously this literally means

85
00:03:35.67 --> 00:03:41.140
expropriate this expropriation being the

86
00:03:38.89 --> 00:03:43.450
taking away of private property from its

87
00:03:41.14 --> 00:03:44.920
owner savez was no fan of private

88
00:03:43.45 --> 00:03:46.600
businesses and it was not uncommon for

89
00:03:44.92 --> 00:03:48.910
him to visit a city and go around

90
00:03:46.6 --> 00:03:50.950
declaring the various businesses be

91
00:03:48.91 --> 00:03:52.750
nationalized this would include all

92
00:03:50.95 --> 00:03:55.180
sorts of businesses including things

93
00:03:52.75 --> 00:03:57.400
like small shops all of this ended up

94
00:03:55.18 --> 00:04:00.850
with Venezuela having an economy if it

95
00:03:57.4 --> 00:04:03.370
was fully dependent on its oil by 2012

96
00:04:00.85 --> 00:04:05.710
Brent barrels were 95 percent of

97
00:04:03.37 --> 00:04:08.080
Venezuela's exports we should also note

98
00:04:05.71 --> 00:04:09.760
it at pdvsa at higher costs than any

99
00:04:08.08 --> 00:04:11.530
other oil company and this was largely

100
00:04:09.76 --> 00:04:13.510
because of the staff increases

101
00:04:11.53 --> 00:04:14.680
nonetheless as long as the oil price

102
00:04:13.51 --> 00:04:16.930
remains high enough to cover the

103
00:04:14.68 --> 00:04:19.510
production costs Venezuela kept making

104
00:04:16.93 --> 00:04:21.520
oil and everyone was happy but just hold

105
00:04:19.51 --> 00:04:24.940
on a minute because this is where things

106
00:04:21.52 --> 00:04:27.010
turn sour in 2014 oil prices fell and

107
00:04:24.94 --> 00:04:29.470
Venezuela was the first country to feel

108
00:04:27.01 --> 00:04:31.810
the effects of this for their profit per

109
00:04:29.47 --> 00:04:32.800
barrel shrank more and more every single

110
00:04:31.81 --> 00:04:34.409
day

111
00:04:32.8 --> 00:04:38.289
[Music]

112
00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.629
nicolas maduro SEDOL up now by the time

113
00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.639
the oil crisis started Hugo Chavez had

114
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:45.669
already passed away and his successor

115
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:50.590
was a guy named Nicolas Maduro really to

116
00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:53.949
see you whistles I was prob er look at

117
00:04:50.59 --> 00:04:55.740
me funny then flew over my hand and I

118
00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.819
could feel the spirit of Shabbos

119
00:04:55.74 --> 00:05:00.340
blessing Jacob although the whole

120
00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.650
darkness you know this is not a joke nor

121
00:05:00.34 --> 00:05:04.300
is it a quote taken out of context

122
00:05:02.65 --> 00:05:05.710
Maduro found himself the head of a

123
00:05:04.3 --> 00:05:08.500
country that wasn't making enough money

124
00:05:05.71 --> 00:05:11.110
from its only export and Maduro

125
00:05:08.5 --> 00:05:14.289
and wages to pay then on top of all this

126
00:05:11.11 --> 00:05:16.060
we have the famous now because of all

127
00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.740
that expropriating that was going on

128
00:05:16.06 --> 00:05:20.379
we've been left with a Venezuela that

129
00:05:17.74 --> 00:05:22.599
has no private companies so even if he

130
00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.939
decided to raise taxes there's no one

131
00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.520
left to pay them and this is when Maduro

132
00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.560
made the most irresponsible decision

133
00:05:27.52 --> 00:05:31.719
that any political leader can make he

134
00:05:29.56 --> 00:05:33.569
decided to print money having devalued

135
00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.550
the Venezuelan currency the believer

136
00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.500
inflation skyrocketed here's an example

137
00:05:36.55 --> 00:05:40.650
of how bad this was imagine you're

138
00:05:38.5 --> 00:05:42.069
sitting in a bar in Caracas in July of

139
00:05:40.65 --> 00:05:44.050
2016

140
00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.120
okay Emily cost you around 50 bolivars

141
00:05:44.05 --> 00:05:48.819
then you go back to the same bar in

142
00:05:46.12 --> 00:05:51.699
Caracas in September and that same beer

143
00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:54.009
would cost you 100 bolivars this has

144
00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.779
been happening in Venezuela consistently

145
00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.779
for the last of three years

146
00:05:58.98 --> 00:06:02.510
[Music]

147
00:06:00.53 --> 00:06:04.130
obviously this had the effect of

148
00:06:02.51 --> 00:06:06.260
destroying all of the poverty reduction

149
00:06:04.13 --> 00:06:08.240
measures that Shem has it implements it

150
00:06:06.26 --> 00:06:09.560
oh and believe me it gets worse from

151
00:06:08.24 --> 00:06:12.410
here just when things were looking

152
00:06:09.56 --> 00:06:14.960
really terrible madero decided to

153
00:06:12.41 --> 00:06:18.350
demonstrate just how much worse they can

154
00:06:14.96 --> 00:06:20.690
get law implemental later the youtubes

155
00:06:18.35 --> 00:06:23.240
to finish with the price increases will

156
00:06:20.69 --> 00:06:25.790
be the creation of the maximum sales

157
00:06:23.24 --> 00:06:27.350
price so much there enter ponies

158
00:06:25.79 --> 00:06:29.870
according to majora the hyperinflation

159
00:06:27.35 --> 00:06:32.270
was caused by those evil capitalists who

160
00:06:29.87 --> 00:06:34.280
wanted to destroy Venezuela so the

161
00:06:32.27 --> 00:06:36.350
logical solution of course was to fight

162
00:06:34.28 --> 00:06:38.660
them so you're probably wondering right

163
00:06:36.35 --> 00:06:40.669
now what exactly the outcome of all of

164
00:06:38.66 --> 00:06:42.710
this is well this time let's imagine

165
00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.350
that you own a butcher's shop in the

166
00:06:42.71 --> 00:06:47.480
beautiful city of Meraki do you buy meat

167
00:06:45.35 --> 00:06:49.610
from a Colombian farmer and you pay with

168
00:06:47.48 --> 00:06:52.190
the US dollars for example let's say

169
00:06:49.61 --> 00:06:54.110
that a pound of beef costs you $10 the

170
00:06:52.19 --> 00:06:57.080
venezuelan central bank has an official

171
00:06:54.11 --> 00:06:58.910
exchange rate of 10 bolivars to 1 US

172
00:06:57.08 --> 00:07:00.650
dollar burn no one's gonna sell your

173
00:06:58.91 --> 00:07:03.260
dollars in that price because the market

174
00:07:00.65 --> 00:07:04.760
price is way higher this means that if

175
00:07:03.26 --> 00:07:07.100
you want to buy beef from your Colombian

176
00:07:04.76 --> 00:07:09.620
producer you're going to have to pay the

177
00:07:07.1 --> 00:07:12.380
price set by the market this is the

178
00:07:09.62 --> 00:07:13.220
equivalent of 10000 bolivars per 10

179
00:07:12.38 --> 00:07:16.429
dollars

180
00:07:13.22 --> 00:07:18.689
[Music]

181
00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:20.099
all right fine but then you go back to

182
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:22.379
your shop and you want to sell this

183
00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.849
pound of beep that you bought but then

184
00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:26.009
you find out that the government has set

185
00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.959
a maximum sale price of a thousand

186
00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.339
bolivars which is ten times less than

187
00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:32.009
what you paid so now you've got two

188
00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:34.799
options you can one close up your shop

189
00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:37.049
or to sell your meat on the black market

190
00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:38.669
now some of you might be wondering why

191
00:07:37.049 --> 00:07:40.409
do they have to buy foreign li why can't

192
00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.419
they just buy meat that was made inside

193
00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:44.669
Venezuela the answer is that whatever

194
00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.919
product you buy it's going to require

195
00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:48.569
something that is made outside of the

196
00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.219
country that you bought the product in

197
00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.869
for example if you want to grow wheat

198
00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.129
you're going to need a tractor which is

199
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:54.539
manufactured somewhere else and you

200
00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:57.179
might find that even the seeds or the

201
00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:59.039
fertilizer are also made in a different

202
00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:00.689
country one way or another there is no

203
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:03.239
country on earth that is capable of

204
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:05.339
producing all that they consume not even

205
00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:07.219
the United States oh and don't forget

206
00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:10.139
now that Venezuela based their entire

207
00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:12.689
economy on the export of oil and today

208
00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.999
still that's not going so well

209
00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:17.429
Venezuelan oil has become so expensive

210
00:08:14.999 --> 00:08:21.860
that they'd rather buy it from external

211
00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:21.860
sources than even use their own oil

212
00:08:23.1 --> 00:08:29.050
Beadie BSA has launched one of its

213
00:08:26.02 --> 00:08:31.600
largest oil tenders ever seeking to buy

214
00:08:29.05 --> 00:08:34.120
some eight million barrels of us or

215
00:08:31.6 --> 00:08:36.070
Nigerian light crude for delivery from

216
00:08:34.12 --> 00:08:37.900
April through June as I mentioned

217
00:08:36.07 --> 00:08:39.789
previously Venezuelan oil is really

218
00:08:37.9 --> 00:08:41.140
expensive to produce and it turns out

219
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.060
that they just rather buy from other

220
00:08:41.14 --> 00:08:45.370
countries than use their own oil

221
00:08:43.06 --> 00:08:47.200
meanwhile shops cannot import goods this

222
00:08:45.37 --> 00:08:49.660
is leading to a scarcity of toilet paper

223
00:08:47.2 --> 00:08:51.730
and has even led to situations where

224
00:08:49.66 --> 00:08:55.140
people have stabbed each other over a

225
00:08:51.73 --> 00:08:55.140
small piece of bread

226
00:08:58.78 --> 00:09:02.890
so now that we've given you the rundown

227
00:09:00.61 --> 00:09:04.750
on Venezuela we'd love to know what you

228
00:09:02.89 --> 00:09:06.760
think do you think Maduro will be able

229
00:09:04.75 --> 00:09:08.380
to pull his country out of collapse do

230
00:09:06.76 --> 00:09:10.000
you see there's an alternative for him

231
00:09:08.38 --> 00:09:12.130
to pursue we'd love to know your opinion
