3
00:00:19.08 --> 00:00:24.820
on the 11th April 2015 a historic

4
00:00:22.6 --> 00:00:29.100
meeting took place between raúl Castro

5
00:00:24.82 --> 00:00:29.100
the president of Cuba and Barack Obama

6
00:00:29.19 --> 00:00:34.149
it was celebrated in Panama and landing

7
00:00:32.11 --> 00:00:37.329
was the first bilateral meeting of the

8
00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.829
US and Cuban presidents in 50 years four

9
00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.840
months earlier both leaders announced

10
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.150
they would remake relations between the

11
00:00:40.84 --> 00:00:45.190
two governments today the United States

12
00:00:43.15 --> 00:00:47.320
of America is changing its relationships

13
00:00:45.19 --> 00:00:49.329
with the people of Cuba and as they said

14
00:00:47.32 --> 00:00:50.800
they would do so was done in just a

15
00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.480
short period of time that he first

16
00:00:50.8 --> 00:00:54.730
changes were made in relations between

17
00:00:52.48 --> 00:00:55.270
both countries started to return to

18
00:00:54.73 --> 00:00:57.309
normal

19
00:00:55.27 --> 00:00:59.140
now I don't seem like we see this a lot

20
00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.630
on this channel but the arrival of

21
00:00:59.14 --> 00:01:04.329
Donald Trump the White House well it

22
00:01:01.63 --> 00:01:05.950
changed everything again the new

23
00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.990
President of the United States has

24
00:01:05.95 --> 00:01:09.969
ordered that the u.s. steps back from

25
00:01:07.99 --> 00:01:13.270
most of the changes that Obama initiated

26
00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.819
with Cuba so the question might be why

27
00:01:13.27 --> 00:01:18.130
is he doing this what does he expect and

28
00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.509
what are the consequences of this new

29
00:01:18.13 --> 00:01:21.549
policy we're going to look at all of

30
00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.170
these questions in this video but before

31
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.880
we do let's have a quick look at the

32
00:01:23.17 --> 00:01:26.960
history of the relations between these

33
00:01:24.88 --> 00:01:29.140
two countries

34
00:01:26.96 --> 00:01:31.890
[Music]

35
00:01:29.14 --> 00:01:34.140
the embargo

36
00:01:31.89 --> 00:01:35.670
after the so-called Cuban Revolution

37
00:01:34.14 --> 00:01:37.470
took place against Batista's

38
00:01:35.67 --> 00:01:40.050
dictatorship the new government and the

39
00:01:37.47 --> 00:01:42.540
islands led by Fidel Castro soon started

40
00:01:40.05 --> 00:01:45.030
to nationalize every kind of capital

41
00:01:42.54 --> 00:01:47.370
good and company land hotel factories

42
00:01:45.03 --> 00:01:49.530
well everything was up for grabs by the

43
00:01:47.37 --> 00:01:51.810
government so the Cuban Revolution ended

44
00:01:49.53 --> 00:01:54.680
on the 1st of January 1959 and already

45
00:01:51.81 --> 00:01:57.150
volume a the government had begun huge

46
00:01:54.68 --> 00:01:59.040
expropriations all across the country

47
00:01:57.15 --> 00:02:00.990
now our and he might probably be able to

48
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:03.780
imagine this is something that the US

49
00:02:00.99 --> 00:02:05.910
did not really take very well there were

50
00:02:03.78 --> 00:02:08.160
thousands of lawsuits filed in the US

51
00:02:05.91 --> 00:02:10.410
which had close relations with Cuba at

52
00:02:08.16 --> 00:02:12.690
the time further if this wasn't enough

53
00:02:10.41 --> 00:02:14.820
to upset the US the Soviet Union was

54
00:02:12.69 --> 00:02:18.989
already getting on well with Fidel

55
00:02:14.82 --> 00:02:21.390
Castro who's at this moment when as a

56
00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.280
penalty Washington passed the first

57
00:02:21.39 --> 00:02:26.550
trade embargo against the island an

58
00:02:23.28 --> 00:02:28.200
embargo that slowly grew stronger as the

59
00:02:26.55 --> 00:02:31.230
relations between these countries were

60
00:02:28.2 --> 00:02:34.050
getting worse in fact after the Missile

61
00:02:31.23 --> 00:02:36.480
Crisis of 1962 at Kennedy even limited

62
00:02:34.05 --> 00:02:38.190
US travel to Cuba since then lands with

63
00:02:36.48 --> 00:02:39.630
the exception of short periods of better

64
00:02:38.19 --> 00:02:41.580
relations under the governments of

65
00:02:39.63 --> 00:02:43.350
foreign Carter's various governments

66
00:02:41.58 --> 00:02:45.630
over the United States have kept to the

67
00:02:43.35 --> 00:02:49.030
embargo and the policy of isolating Cuba

68
00:02:45.63 --> 00:02:51.310
economically in place

69
00:02:49.03 --> 00:02:53.530
Ronald Reagan labeled the island as a

70
00:02:51.31 --> 00:02:55.240
sponsor of terrorism and later Bill

71
00:02:53.53 --> 00:02:57.160
Clinton made even more severe

72
00:02:55.24 --> 00:02:59.020
restrictions and the embargo was put

73
00:02:57.16 --> 00:03:01.270
into law since then traveling to Cuba

74
00:02:59.02 --> 00:03:03.130
and investing in Cuba or doing business

75
00:03:01.27 --> 00:03:08.800
with the Cuban government has been very

76
00:03:03.13 --> 00:03:14.040
limited for Americans well that is until

77
00:03:08.8 --> 00:03:17.050
Barack Obama came to office in February

78
00:03:14.04 --> 00:03:19.510
2008 Fidel past power to his brother

79
00:03:17.05 --> 00:03:21.790
Raul Castro that same year elections

80
00:03:19.51 --> 00:03:23.410
took place and Obama said it was time to

81
00:03:21.79 --> 00:03:26.140
use a different approach with Cuba it

82
00:03:23.41 --> 00:03:28.830
was time to improve diplomatic relations

83
00:03:26.14 --> 00:03:31.120
between the two countries

84
00:03:28.83 --> 00:03:32.739
Obama didn't want to wait and shortly

85
00:03:31.12 --> 00:03:34.269
after he arrived in the White House he

86
00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.430
softened some of the restrictions that

87
00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.410
were in place on Cuba for example he

88
00:03:36.43 --> 00:03:40.690
allowed Cubans in the u.s. to send money

89
00:03:38.41 --> 00:03:42.700
to the island and he started to allow US

90
00:03:40.69 --> 00:03:44.500
citizens to travel to Cuba many more

91
00:03:42.7 --> 00:03:46.120
things followed these first gestures

92
00:03:44.5 --> 00:03:48.280
during the years Obama was in office

93
00:03:46.12 --> 00:03:54.370
many restrictions against Cuba were

94
00:03:48.28 --> 00:03:56.650
reduced and in December of that year Rao

95
00:03:54.37 --> 00:03:58.989
Castro and Obama met in Panama

96
00:03:56.65 --> 00:04:01.450
significant progress was being made but

97
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.820
I think what we have both concluded is

98
00:04:01.45 --> 00:04:11.320
that we can disagree with a spirit of

99
00:04:05.82 --> 00:04:14.200
respect and civility and that over time

100
00:04:11.32 --> 00:04:16.720
it is possible for us to turn the page

101
00:04:14.2 --> 00:04:19.090
and develop a new relationship between

102
00:04:16.72 --> 00:04:22.240
our two countries and that is how to

103
00:04:19.09 --> 00:04:24.400
great moments took place in 2015 the

104
00:04:22.24 --> 00:04:27.400
embassies reopened in both countries and

105
00:04:24.4 --> 00:04:29.430
in March of 2016 Air Force one landed in

106
00:04:27.4 --> 00:04:37.470
Havana for the first time in history

108
00:04:37.65 --> 00:04:44.979
Seba hadn't posted a sitting American

109
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:47.080
president since 1928 a policy of

110
00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.939
isolation designed for the Cold War made

111
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:50.889
little sense in the 21st century

112
00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:53.979
the embargo was only hurting the Cuban

113
00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:57.400
people instead of helping it's time to

114
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.199
let the embargo it is time now for us to

115
00:04:57.4 --> 00:05:01.479
leave the past behind it is time for us

116
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.719
to look forward to the future together

117
00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.879
Roberto de esperanza of all these new

118
00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.800
policies towards Cuba with taking over

119
00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.779
and even though the embargo and laws

120
00:05:08.8 --> 00:05:12.580
were technically still enforced the

121
00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.680
Obama administration managed to find

122
00:05:12.58 --> 00:05:16.240
legal loopholes to allow the relations

123
00:05:14.68 --> 00:05:18.219
between these two countries to be

124
00:05:16.24 --> 00:05:19.749
something close to normal when Ivana

125
00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.580
left the White House Americans could

126
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.620
travel freely to Cuba immigrants could

127
00:05:21.58 --> 00:05:25.809
send unlimited money back to the country

128
00:05:23.62 --> 00:05:27.639
American companies could invest in Cuba

129
00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.559
and even planes of American companies

130
00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.969
frequently landed at Jose Marti

131
00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:33.430
International Airport the new

132
00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.439
relationship well it was working but

133
00:05:33.43 --> 00:05:37.749
then Donald Trump's became President of

134
00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:42.120
the United States and as we already

135
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:42.120
mentioned everything changed

Trump and Cuba on the 16th of June 2017

138
00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:56.199
Trump decided to take this new policy

139
00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.930
back and he did so in a neighborhood of

140
00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.939
Miami called Little Havana effective

141
00:05:58.93 --> 00:06:03.009
immediately I am canceling the last

142
00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.379
administration's completely one-sided

143
00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.330
deal with Cuba as soon as he finished

144
00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.990
his speech Trump signed guidelines for

145
00:06:07.33 --> 00:06:10.539
his so-called

146
00:06:07.99 --> 00:06:12.399
new policy with Cuba after a 50 year

147
00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:16.740
embargo with the country it could hardly

148
00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:16.740
be described as actually being new

149
00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.319
Trump will completely reverse Obama's

150
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.539
policies many will be maintained for

151
00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.099
example the opening of embassies and

152
00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.189
commercial flights between the two

153
00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.409
countries however from now on trips of

154
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.759
Americans to Cuba will be limited as

155
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.369
they won't be able to go individually

156
00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.719
and any relationship with diesem they

157
00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:37.909
holding group directed by the

158
00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.740
governments which controls more than 50%

159
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.020
of the Cuban economy will be forbidden

160
00:06:39.74 --> 00:06:44.389
but don't think that Trump has always

161
00:06:42.02 --> 00:06:46.999
had this hardline attitude towards Cuba

162
00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.129
quite the opposite in fact in 1998 he

163
00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:50.929
tried to build a hotel on the island

164
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.339
contradicting the embargo and at the

165
00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:54.289
beginning of 2016

166
00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:56.300
he supported Obama's new policies

167
00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.679
towards the country but here a visual

168
00:06:56.3 --> 00:06:59.389
politic we think that Trump's attitude

169
00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:02.090
towards Cuba well it could be a mistake

170
00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.090
so let's have a look at exactly why

171
00:07:02.09 --> 00:07:04.140

174
00:07:06.23 --> 00:07:11.469
Trump's mistake

175
00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.749
let's make one thing really clear right

176
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:17.709
now the embargo against Cuba has been a

177
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:19.959
total failure the US embargo which is

178
00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:22.360
blocked all trade and investment with

179
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:24.279
Cuba for the past 55 years has not

180
00:07:22.36 --> 00:07:25.779
worked this failed to isolate the Cuban

181
00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.939
government failed to regain any

182
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.409
nationalized property and succeeded in

183
00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:31.419
giving an excuse to the Castro

184
00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:34.360
government for its abuses and economic

185
00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:36.849
mismanagement for more than 50 years the

186
00:07:34.36 --> 00:07:38.919
embargo has been completely useless it

187
00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:40.629
hasn't accomplished anything and on top

188
00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.819
of that of the Cuban government has used

189
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:45.279
it as an excuse to justify their poor

190
00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:47.409
economic situation but wait just a

191
00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:49.959
second it because this is not the end of

192
00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:52.059
it not even close reversing Obama's

193
00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:54.399
policies is a mistake for several

194
00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:56.289
reasons importantly improved relations

195
00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:58.779
with the US have meant better security

196
00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:00.879
for the United States Obama signed

197
00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.289
several important cooperation agreements

198
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.329
and since 2015

199
00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:06.969
given authorities have given information

200
00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:09.009
on drug and human trafficking to the US

201
00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:10.989
and on the other hand Russia and China

202
00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:15.309
have also set their eyes on the island

203
00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:18.289
again russia says it may reopen Soviet

204
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:20.240
error military bases in Cuba

205
00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:22.339
you can probably imagine what a blow the

206
00:08:20.24 --> 00:08:24.979
national security of the United States

207
00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:27.229
this would be this is why making

208
00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:29.059
relations more difficult means nothing

209
00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:31.430
more than forcing the Cuban government

210
00:08:29.059 --> 00:08:34.550
you seek better relations with Moscow or

211
00:08:31.43 --> 00:08:37.669
Beijing not exactly a brilliant option

212
00:08:34.55 --> 00:08:40.459
for the US and there is so much more

213
00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.589
Trump new policy will only damage the

214
00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:45.050
interests of many American companies as

215
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:48.550
well as put at risk see major changes

216
00:08:45.05 --> 00:08:53.029
that are taking place on the island

217
00:08:48.55 --> 00:08:54.889
how is Cuba changing since raúl Castro

218
00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:56.569
came to power he has admitted that Cuba

219
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:59.029
needs a change of directions and that

220
00:08:56.569 --> 00:09:00.350
the Cuban model simply is not working

221
00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:02.600
some people are saying that he wants to

222
00:09:00.35 --> 00:09:05.209
emulate China be open to the world thus

223
00:09:02.6 --> 00:09:07.910
maintain control the truth is that up

224
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:10.399
until now changes have been scarce and

225
00:09:07.91 --> 00:09:12.649
slow but even so these changes could be

226
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.420
self and now the Venezuela can no longer

227
00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:17.540
help the islands these changes have

228
00:09:14.42 --> 00:09:18.680
become more and more urgent so now let's

229
00:09:17.54 --> 00:09:21.560
have a look at what's been happening

230
00:09:18.68 --> 00:09:23.779
since 2011 when reforms took place and

231
00:09:21.56 --> 00:09:27.589
freelance entrepreneurship was made a

232
00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:29.690
lot easier since 2011 the number of

233
00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:31.310
self-employed workers in Cuba is four

234
00:09:29.69 --> 00:09:33.139
times larger and today the number

235
00:09:31.31 --> 00:09:34.519
exceeds half a million workers the

236
00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:35.810
government is also allowed private

237
00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:37.699
farming for small farmers and

238
00:09:35.81 --> 00:09:39.529
restaurants and small tourism businesses

239
00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:43.550
are growing and spreading across the

240
00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:45.949
country the vault is open this wealth it

241
00:09:43.55 --> 00:09:48.290
certainly helps this process for example

242
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:50.089
almost all private businesses in Cuba

243
00:09:48.29 --> 00:09:52.760
are working off money coming in from

244
00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:55.040
abroad a B&amp;B already has 22,000

245
00:09:52.76 --> 00:09:57.290
apartments homes or rooms available in

246
00:09:55.04 --> 00:09:59.269
Cuba further we shouldn't forget about

247
00:09:57.29 --> 00:10:01.370
less tangible things like the exchange

248
00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:04.209
of ideas mutual knowledge and the

249
00:10:01.37 --> 00:10:06.980
strengthening of the private sector

250
00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:09.319
every dollar left in the hands of cab

251
00:10:06.98 --> 00:10:11.689
drivers hotel workers waitresses and

252
00:10:09.319 --> 00:10:14.329
valets is a show of what awaits Cubans

253
00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:16.970
if they reject socialism US Senator Rand

254
00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:18.949
Paul take a look at China and compare

255
00:10:16.97 --> 00:10:21.380
the country as it is today to the

256
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:22.970
country it was during Mao's time since

257
00:10:21.38 --> 00:10:24.680
the country opened itself up to the

258
00:10:22.97 --> 00:10:27.829
world hundreds of millions of people

259
00:10:24.68 --> 00:10:29.930
have left poverty behind yes China like

260
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:32.029
Cuba it's still a terrible dictatorship

261
00:10:29.93 --> 00:10:32.370
but thanks to their open policy the

262
00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:34.470
chine

263
00:10:32.37 --> 00:10:36.029
these house today more freedom and a

264
00:10:34.47 --> 00:10:42.900
better standard of living than they've

265
00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:45.060
ever had before the short of the matter

266
00:10:42.9 --> 00:10:47.520
is that the embargo policy well it

267
00:10:45.06 --> 00:10:49.020
failed and Trump's insistence in going

268
00:10:47.52 --> 00:10:51.210
back to it is not going to achieve

269
00:10:49.02 --> 00:10:53.070
anything that the weakening of security

270
00:10:51.21 --> 00:10:55.110
in the United States lead to further

271
00:10:53.07 --> 00:10:57.120
poverty in Cuba and prevent the changes

272
00:10:55.11 --> 00:10:59.550
that are happening on the island in

273
00:10:57.12 --> 00:11:01.710
February of 2018 Castro is going to

274
00:10:59.55 --> 00:11:06.810
leave power and this is not the moment

275
00:11:01.71 --> 00:11:08.640
for the u.s. to take a step back in

276
00:11:06.81 --> 00:11:10.920
order to justify his decision Trump says

277
00:11:08.64 --> 00:11:12.690
he wants to defend human rights which is

278
00:11:10.92 --> 00:11:14.910
nice but don't you think is a bit

279
00:11:12.69 --> 00:11:16.589
hypocritical to defend Cuba's embargo

280
00:11:14.91 --> 00:11:19.050
while at the same time he hugs the

281
00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:24.900
leaders of Saudi Arabia I mean human

282
00:11:19.05 --> 00:11:26.940
rights not important that importantly 10

283
00:11:24.9 --> 00:11:29.520
Republicans have also criticized this

284
00:11:26.94 --> 00:11:31.320
course change with Cuba any policy

285
00:11:29.52 --> 00:11:33.510
change that diminishes the ability of

286
00:11:31.32 --> 00:11:35.970
Americans to travel freely to Cuba is

287
00:11:33.51 --> 00:11:38.760
not in the best interests of the United

288
00:11:35.97 --> 00:11:41.640
States or the Cuban people US Senator

289
