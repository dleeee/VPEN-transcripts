2
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.269
here a visual politic we're not exactly

3
00:00:09.75 --> 00:00:13.980
massive fans of Donald Trump and viewers

4
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.900
of our spanish-language channel we'll

5
00:00:13.98 --> 00:00:18.720
know particularly however there is one

6
00:00:15.9 --> 00:00:21.210
area where we must admit that Donald

7
00:00:18.72 --> 00:00:22.830
Trump is absolutely correct

8
00:00:21.21 --> 00:00:25.350
if you want to be a citizen of Mexico

9
00:00:22.83 --> 00:00:27.359
you and let's assume you're a person

10
00:00:25.35 --> 00:00:28.740
aversion okay you want to be if you

11
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.019
could not become a citizen of Mexico

12
00:00:28.74 --> 00:00:32.940
it's the hardest place just about in the

13
00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.430
country in the world to become a citizen

14
00:00:32.94 --> 00:00:37.440
it's like in this case Donald Trump is

15
00:00:35.43 --> 00:00:39.629
telling the truth Mexico has an

16
00:00:37.44 --> 00:00:41.520
immigration policy that is way more

17
00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
restrictive than the American one you

18
00:00:41.52 --> 00:00:45.750
understand this better in 2015 the

19
00:00:44.34 --> 00:00:48.480
Mexican government kicked out of its

20
00:00:45.75 --> 00:00:50.879
country 100,000 foreigners while its

21
00:00:48.48 --> 00:00:52.590
neighbor to the north kicked out 300,000

22
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.539
okay so actually on the face of things

23
00:00:52.59 --> 00:00:56.969
that looks as if the u.s. supports more

24
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.160
people than Mexico right I mean 300,000

25
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.440
versus 100,000 but you really must think

26
00:00:59.16 --> 00:01:03.329
about this in relative term for one

27
00:01:01.44 --> 00:01:05.159
Mexico's population is three times

28
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.500
smaller than the United States and it's

29
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.369
also a far less attractive destination

30
00:01:07.5 --> 00:01:10.369
for immigrants

31
00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.119
dad said we can say that the Mexican

32
00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.829
authorities support nearly everyone who

33
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.840
crosses into the country through their

34
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.030
southern border with saline and

35
00:01:24.84 --> 00:01:28.439
Guatemala that is they deport all of the

36
00:01:27.03 --> 00:01:30.450
people who decide to stay in Mexico

37
00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.819
rather than heading further north to the

38
00:01:30.45 --> 00:01:35.310
United States in fact while America has

39
00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.170
an immigrant population of 14% which is

40
00:01:35.31 --> 00:01:39.179
by the way average in terms of developed

41
00:01:37.17 --> 00:01:46.859
countries Mexico has an immigrant

42
00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:49.409
population of just 1% in fact while the

43
00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.840
Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto

44
00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.780
always saying this to Donald Trump los

45
00:01:51.84 --> 00:01:57.840
mexicanos en estados unidos so gente

46
00:01:54.78 --> 00:02:01.079
enesta Americans living in u.s. our

47
00:01:57.84 --> 00:02:04.289
honor hard-working people they are good

48
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.239
people they respect family they respect

49
00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.959
their communities and they deserve

50
00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.049
respect

51
00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.220
como tal los mexicanos medicine el

52
00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.010
respeto

53
00:02:11.22 --> 00:02:16.440
de todos 48 percent of the Mexican

54
00:02:14.01 --> 00:02:18.299
population holds a negative or very

55
00:02:16.44 --> 00:02:21.269
negative opinion about immigrants from

56
00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.829
Central America in fact in 2016 a

57
00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.100
Mexican newspaper called la manana

58
00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.720
published the following

59
00:02:24.1 --> 00:02:29.880
[Music]

60
00:02:26.72 --> 00:02:32.730
yes to the border wall but in the south

61
00:02:29.88 --> 00:02:34.890
of Mexico the problems between the US

62
00:02:32.73 --> 00:02:36.960
and Mexico can be solved by building a

63
00:02:34.89 --> 00:02:39.660
border like the one proposed by Donald

64
00:02:36.96 --> 00:02:42.060
Trump but in the south so we can keep

65
00:02:39.66 --> 00:02:44.130
illegal aliens out of Central America

66
00:02:42.06 --> 00:02:46.110
it's so rather interesting right and

67
00:02:44.13 --> 00:02:48.000
that's why in today's visual politic

68
00:02:46.11 --> 00:02:52.530
video we're going to be looking in to

69
00:02:48.0 --> 00:02:54.810
Mexico's immigration policy why does

70
00:02:52.53 --> 00:02:56.640
mexico deport Central American

71
00:02:54.81 --> 00:02:58.050
immigrants the first thing that we need

72
00:02:56.64 --> 00:03:00.060
to understand before talking about

73
00:02:58.05 --> 00:03:02.370
immigration to Mexico is their

74
00:03:00.06 --> 00:03:04.560
geographical location let's imagine that

75
00:03:02.37 --> 00:03:06.600
you live in Nicaragua and you want to

76
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:08.160
move to the United States let's also say

77
00:03:06.6 --> 00:03:10.260
that you have no money to purchase a

78
00:03:08.16 --> 00:03:12.300
plane ticket in this case the only way

79
00:03:10.26 --> 00:03:14.910
for you to get from Nicaragua to the

80
00:03:12.3 --> 00:03:17.190
United States is by land and that means

81
00:03:14.91 --> 00:03:19.170
going through Mexico currently the

82
00:03:17.19 --> 00:03:21.180
biggest flow of immigrants in the world

83
00:03:19.17 --> 00:03:24.380
is from Central America to the United

84
00:03:21.18 --> 00:03:24.380
States of America

85
00:03:25.56 --> 00:03:30.870
in 2015 alone over 22 million people

86
00:03:28.83 --> 00:03:32.880
made this trip it's an extremely

87
00:03:30.87 --> 00:03:34.740
dangerous journey on roads that are in

88
00:03:32.88 --> 00:03:36.900
terrible condition and immigrants also

89
00:03:34.74 --> 00:03:39.000
passed through some incredibly violent

90
00:03:36.9 --> 00:03:41.520
areas and don't forget Mexican states

91
00:03:39.0 --> 00:03:43.920
like chapathi Aereo in Sinaloa the

92
00:03:41.52 --> 00:03:46.290
hotspot for drug trafficking welcome to

93
00:03:43.92 --> 00:03:49.440
las olas procedures these are for all

94
00:03:46.29 --> 00:03:51.810
kinds of abuses acquis extortion mapping

95
00:03:49.44 --> 00:03:54.510
for human trafficking drug trafficking

96
00:03:51.81 --> 00:03:55.590
human and sexual slavery personal

97
00:03:54.51 --> 00:03:57.030
relationships life

98
00:03:55.59 --> 00:03:58.650
do you understand this better when some

99
00:03:57.03 --> 00:04:00.480
of the immigrants arrive in the south of

100
00:03:58.65 --> 00:04:02.940
Mexico they have to continue their

101
00:04:00.48 --> 00:04:05.310
journey to the US on the roof of a train

102
00:04:02.94 --> 00:04:07.500
this train has become known as the Beast

103
00:04:05.31 --> 00:04:09.720
or the death train and it's not hard to

104
00:04:07.5 --> 00:04:12.690
figure out why with an ejaculation why

105
00:04:09.72 --> 00:04:15.390
some immigrants inside to see Mexico

106
00:04:12.69 --> 00:04:16.769
this situation was the perfect excuse

107
00:04:15.39 --> 00:04:20.340
for the Mexican government to pass

108
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.460
Veerle to pop the ser or population law

109
00:04:20.34 --> 00:04:25.200
this was passed in the mid-1970s the law

110
00:04:23.46 --> 00:04:27.210
was poly put into place in order to

111
00:04:25.2 --> 00:04:29.040
restrict the flow of immigrants to the

112
00:04:27.21 --> 00:04:31.590
country in order to avoid human

113
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:33.390
trafficking and abuse so this sounds

114
00:04:31.59 --> 00:04:35.130
like a well intentioned law so what

115
00:04:33.39 --> 00:04:36.600
exactly was the problem here well what

116
00:04:35.13 --> 00:04:38.340
it first appeared to be something good

117
00:04:36.6 --> 00:04:39.690
for foreigners it quickly became hell

118
00:04:38.34 --> 00:04:42.419
for them and now you may be wondering

119
00:04:39.69 --> 00:04:44.490
what exactly made this law quite so bad

120
00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.900
for immigrant well quite simply it gave

121
00:04:44.49 --> 00:04:47.970
the government the power to expel

122
00:04:45.9 --> 00:04:49.090
foreigners for reasons as ludicrous as

123
00:04:47.97 --> 00:04:50.680
this one

124
00:04:49.09 --> 00:04:53.960
[Music]

125
00:04:50.68 --> 00:04:56.180
the secretary can deny foreigners and

126
00:04:53.96 --> 00:04:58.250
comes to the country or change the

127
00:04:56.18 --> 00:05:00.860
quality or characteristics of the

128
00:04:58.25 --> 00:05:05.000
migration in order to keep a demographic

129
00:05:00.86 --> 00:05:07.640
balance in otherwise Mexico only wants

130
00:05:05.0 --> 00:05:09.470
immigrants from wealthy countries and if

131
00:05:07.64 --> 00:05:11.570
possible it's better if that skin is

132
00:05:09.47 --> 00:05:13.790
white and well what's the result of all

133
00:05:11.57 --> 00:05:16.010
this well it turns out that seven out of

134
00:05:13.79 --> 00:05:18.020
every ten immigrants to Mexico are from

135
00:05:16.01 --> 00:05:19.370
the United States and what about the

136
00:05:18.02 --> 00:05:21.680
rest of them what about that other three

137
00:05:19.37 --> 00:05:23.420
well they're mostly from Spain in fact

138
00:05:21.68 --> 00:05:25.790
Mexican have twice as many Spaniards

139
00:05:23.42 --> 00:05:27.860
living in it as it does Guatemala now

140
00:05:25.79 --> 00:05:29.300
this wouldn't exactly be a big surprise

141
00:05:27.86 --> 00:05:32.600
except for the fact that Guatemala

142
00:05:29.3 --> 00:05:37.240
shares a border with Mexico and Spain is

143
00:05:32.6 --> 00:05:37.240
thousands of miles away across an ocean

144
00:05:38.65 --> 00:05:43.850
but this is not all Mexico has an equal

145
00:05:41.81 --> 00:05:46.760
number of German immigrants as it does

146
00:05:43.85 --> 00:05:48.410
Peruvian so if you come from Europe or

147
00:05:46.76 --> 00:05:51.200
the United States you're going to have

148
00:05:48.41 --> 00:05:53.120
no problem getting a visa for Mexico

149
00:05:51.2 --> 00:05:56.000
apparently you're helping to improve

150
00:05:53.12 --> 00:05:57.710
that a demographic balance but if you

151
00:05:56.0 --> 00:05:59.780
happen to be from Peru and want to live

152
00:05:57.71 --> 00:06:02.600
in the country of Robert Rodriguez well

153
00:05:59.78 --> 00:06:04.770
good luck to the Mexican government you

154
00:06:02.6 --> 00:06:07.959
are nothing more than a demographic

155
00:06:04.77 --> 00:06:07.959
[Music]

156
00:06:08.3 --> 00:06:12.450
but hold on for a second because there's

157
00:06:11.13 --> 00:06:14.790
more according to the

158
00:06:12.45 --> 00:06:17.940
previously-mentioned law being an

159
00:06:14.79 --> 00:06:19.950
immigrant in Mexico is a felony this

160
00:06:17.94 --> 00:06:22.290
means that at any moment federal agents

161
00:06:19.95 --> 00:06:23.820
can request your documentation and if

162
00:06:22.29 --> 00:06:25.200
you don't have that documentation you

163
00:06:23.82 --> 00:06:27.930
can be forced to leave the country and

164
00:06:25.2 --> 00:06:30.090
pay a fine of two months average salary

165
00:06:27.93 --> 00:06:31.770
in Mexico okay okay so now you might be

166
00:06:30.09 --> 00:06:33.420
thinking well every country gets to

167
00:06:31.77 --> 00:06:35.580
determine its own immigration policy

168
00:06:33.42 --> 00:06:37.800
right well that's absolutely right and

169
00:06:35.58 --> 00:06:40.440
until 2010 and no other government

170
00:06:37.8 --> 00:06:43.680
complained about Mexico's immigration

171
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:48.660
policy in 2010 something happened that

172
00:06:43.68 --> 00:06:51.420
embarrassed the entire nation Arizona

173
00:06:48.66 --> 00:06:54.090
Governor Jan Brewer on Friday signs of

174
00:06:51.42 --> 00:06:55.920
state immigration bill into law it is

175
00:06:54.09 --> 00:06:58.470
considered to be among the toughest

176
00:06:55.92 --> 00:07:00.720
legislation in the nation as ironic as

177
00:06:58.47 --> 00:07:03.510
it sounds Arizona law which was meant to

178
00:07:00.72 --> 00:07:05.940
stop immigrants from Mexico was a copy

179
00:07:03.51 --> 00:07:07.620
of that same Mexican law but it's

180
00:07:05.94 --> 00:07:08.280
actually in practice it was slightly

181
00:07:07.62 --> 00:07:10.470
less extreme

182
00:07:08.28 --> 00:07:12.810
for example while Arizona's government

183
00:07:10.47 --> 00:07:14.340
considers it to be a felony to be an

184
00:07:12.81 --> 00:07:16.200
illegal immigrant it doesn't really

185
00:07:14.34 --> 00:07:18.030
matter because Arizona's state law

186
00:07:16.2 --> 00:07:19.980
doesn't apply to the federal government

187
00:07:18.03 --> 00:07:22.470
so the reality was the federal police

188
00:07:19.98 --> 00:07:23.850
could do nothing nevertheless this law

189
00:07:22.47 --> 00:07:25.770
caught the attention of the world's

190
00:07:23.85 --> 00:07:28.800
media and the president back then

191
00:07:25.77 --> 00:07:31.020
Felipe Calderon didn't remain silent so

192
00:07:28.8 --> 00:07:33.000
that regulation gets a century in

193
00:07:31.02 --> 00:07:35.520
criminal every regulation that

194
00:07:33.0 --> 00:07:38.460
criminalizes immigration a social

195
00:07:35.52 --> 00:07:41.370
phenomenon and economic phenomena every

196
00:07:38.46 --> 00:07:43.650
law that penalizes it is an opening at

197
00:07:41.37 --> 00:07:45.780
the door for intolerance hate and

198
00:07:43.65 --> 00:07:48.030
discrimination abuse will aplicación de

199
00:07:45.78 --> 00:07:49.980
la ley and well there you have it

200
00:07:48.03 --> 00:07:52.170
since that day dictionaries next the

201
00:07:49.98 --> 00:07:54.750
word hypocrisy has started including a

202
00:07:52.17 --> 00:07:56.640
picture of Felipe Calderon and quickly

203
00:07:54.75 --> 00:07:58.500
following the statement came the world's

204
00:07:56.64 --> 00:08:00.450
reaction the Mexican government's were

205
00:07:58.5 --> 00:08:02.370
forced to change their population law

206
00:08:00.45 --> 00:08:04.560
that we mentioned this meant that

207
00:08:02.37 --> 00:08:06.420
immigration to Mexico was no longer a

208
00:08:04.56 --> 00:08:08.280
felony plus deal with on that for just

209
00:08:06.42 --> 00:08:10.790
one second because that is not the end

210
00:08:08.28 --> 00:08:10.790
of our story

211
00:08:12.3 --> 00:08:16.960
yes it is true that Mexico changed its

212
00:08:15.07 --> 00:08:18.610
immigration law but it didn't do so in

213
00:08:16.96 --> 00:08:20.230
time remember when I said that the

214
00:08:18.61 --> 00:08:22.540
Mexican Federal Police can request

215
00:08:20.23 --> 00:08:25.990
documentation of any person at any time

216
00:08:22.54 --> 00:08:27.850
well that is still happening today today

217
00:08:25.99 --> 00:08:29.350
in the United States the authorities

218
00:08:27.85 --> 00:08:30.850
need to suspect you of committing a

219
00:08:29.35 --> 00:08:32.740
crime if they want to ask you the

220
00:08:30.85 --> 00:08:34.090
documentation this means it's not very

221
00:08:32.74 --> 00:08:35.800
easy for them to stop you on the street

222
00:08:34.09 --> 00:08:38.050
and arrest you for being than being

223
00:08:35.8 --> 00:08:40.719
eliminated meanwhile down in Mexico this

224
00:08:38.05 --> 00:08:42.400
is happening every single day add to

225
00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:44.260
this the limited control of the country

226
00:08:42.4 --> 00:08:50.560
having with our own police force and you

227
00:08:44.26 --> 00:08:52.870
get stories like this one to escape the

228
00:08:50.56 --> 00:08:55.510
potassium migrants often pay bribes

229
00:08:52.87 --> 00:08:58.240
through i'mmm agents of between 30 and

230
00:08:55.51 --> 00:08:59.830
300 dollars and of course the mass

231
00:08:58.24 --> 00:09:01.720
deportations of Central American

232
00:08:59.83 --> 00:09:03.580
immigrants remain exactly the same but

233
00:09:01.72 --> 00:09:04.960
do you really think the Mexico is the

234
00:09:03.58 --> 00:09:08.080
only place where this is happening

235
00:09:04.96 --> 00:09:09.670
because the answer is absolutely not now

236
00:09:08.08 --> 00:09:11.470
normally when we talk about immigration

237
00:09:09.67 --> 00:09:13.390
we're normally talking about people who

238
00:09:11.47 --> 00:09:14.440
are living in a poor country moving to a

239
00:09:13.39 --> 00:09:23.900
rich country

241
00:09:23.9 --> 00:09:30.080
the truth is in 2015 over 18 million

242
00:09:27.71 --> 00:09:31.940
people moved from one poor country to

243
00:09:30.08 --> 00:09:33.620
another poor country they were just

244
00:09:31.94 --> 00:09:35.180
moving to a poor country that is

245
00:09:33.62 --> 00:09:37.160
slightly better off than their original

246
00:09:35.18 --> 00:09:39.320
country as an example every year

247
00:09:37.16 --> 00:09:41.810
thousands of people move from Bangladesh

248
00:09:39.32 --> 00:09:44.390
to India and the authorities don't

249
00:09:41.81 --> 00:09:46.430
exactly welcome them with open arms just

250
00:09:44.39 --> 00:09:48.170
consider what Narendra Modi said the

251
00:09:46.43 --> 00:09:48.660
Indian president when he was running for

252

these Vama Veche is better be prepared

00:09:57.82 --> 00:10:02.170
with their backs back this is really a

257
00:10:00.04 --> 00:10:04.150
big difference when compared to the

258
00:10:02.17 --> 00:10:06.730
immigrant friendly policies of countries

259
00:10:04.15 --> 00:10:08.770
like Canada or New Zealand which by the

260
00:10:06.73 --> 00:10:09.660
way are some of the wealthiest countries

what you think do you think that Europe

example set by countries like Mexico and
