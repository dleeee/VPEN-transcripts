2
00:00:07.37 --> 00:00:12.690
unless you live in a cave and your only

3
00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.580
source of news is visual politic in

4
00:00:12.69 --> 00:00:17.400
which case thank you very much you

5
00:00:14.58 --> 00:00:19.920
probably realize that Fidel Castro died

6
00:00:17.4 --> 00:00:22.500
and with his death a communist icon

7
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:26.130
disappears Fidel Castro ruled over Cuba

8
00:00:22.5 --> 00:00:27.599
with an iron fist for over 50 years now

9
00:00:26.13 --> 00:00:29.400
many people wonder where the Fidel's

10
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
death will be the first step in a

11
00:00:29.4 --> 00:00:34.170
transition for Cuba a transition from a

12
00:00:31.98 --> 00:00:37.770
communist dictatorship to a liberal

13
00:00:34.17 --> 00:00:40.020
democracy so the reality is is that

14
00:00:37.77 --> 00:00:42.329
Fidel Castro retired from politics in

15
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:45.180
2008 handing over power to his little

16
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.160
brother Raul Castro keeping Cuba really

17
00:00:45.18 --> 00:00:48.840
in the family business the truth is that

18
00:00:47.16 --> 00:00:51.899
Raul found himself having to apply

19
00:00:48.84 --> 00:00:53.489
several reforms in Cuba reforms that not

20
00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.289
such a long time ago would have been

21
00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.840
impossible to imagine in a regime that

22
00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.850
touted itself as the perfect communist

23
00:00:57.84 --> 00:01:04.979
system clearly Castro ISM is done at

24
00:01:02.85 --> 00:01:06.810
least the way we know it no one really

25
00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.299
knows what will become of Cuba but one

26
00:01:06.81 --> 00:01:11.490
thing is for a salute certain it's

27
00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.990
changing well you all asked for a video

28
00:01:11.49 --> 00:01:14.790
about Cuba and you know that here a

29
00:01:12.99 --> 00:01:16.799
visual politic we do like to think

30
00:01:14.79 --> 00:01:18.270
outside of the box so in this video

31
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.680
we're answering a very important

32
00:01:18.27 --> 00:01:22.770
question that we believe has been

33
00:01:19.68 --> 00:01:25.770
answered yet is now a good time to

34
00:01:22.77 --> 00:01:27.630
invest in Cuba is it possible to make

35
00:01:25.77 --> 00:01:29.579
money out of these political changes

36
00:01:27.63 --> 00:01:33.110
that are expected on the island today

37
00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.110
we're going to answer that question

38
00:01:33.8 --> 00:01:38.310
history shows us that when an economy

39
00:01:35.97 --> 00:01:41.160
goes from a planned one to a free-market

40
00:01:38.31 --> 00:01:43.860
one there is a window of time where it's

41
00:01:41.16 --> 00:01:45.810
possible to make a fortune a good

42
00:01:43.86 --> 00:01:47.370
example of this is the Czech Republic

43
00:01:45.81 --> 00:01:49.470
particularly in the city of Prague where

44
00:01:47.37 --> 00:01:50.760
I'm making this video I am British but I

45
00:01:49.47 --> 00:01:53.070
live in Prague now at the beginning of

46
00:01:50.76 --> 00:01:54.930
the 1990s the Czech Republic was opening

47
00:01:53.07 --> 00:01:57.510
up its economy for the first time after

48
00:01:54.93 --> 00:01:59.700
decades of communism this means that for

49
00:01:57.51 --> 00:02:02.960
the first time in years you could buy

50
00:01:59.7 --> 00:02:02.960
and sell houses

51
00:02:04.79 --> 00:02:08.780
but not only that since the country was

52
00:02:06.83 --> 00:02:11.450
relatively poor the price of property

53
00:02:08.78 --> 00:02:13.370
was very low this attracted a lot of

54
00:02:11.45 --> 00:02:15.380
foreign investors particularly from the

55
00:02:13.37 --> 00:02:17.990
north of Italy they were buying property

56
00:02:15.38 --> 00:02:20.870
for almost no money at all then years

57
00:02:17.99 --> 00:02:23.120
later the Czech economy started growing

58
00:02:20.87 --> 00:02:26.060
fast foreign company who came and

59
00:02:23.12 --> 00:02:27.920
settled down here tourism grew and local

60
00:02:26.06 --> 00:02:29.750
people started companies in a short time

61
00:02:27.92 --> 00:02:31.430
the price of houses doubled and those

62
00:02:29.75 --> 00:02:37.370
people who invested early became

63
00:02:31.43 --> 00:02:39.470
millionaire a very similar thing might

64
00:02:37.37 --> 00:02:41.180
just happen in Cuba but hold on just a

65
00:02:39.47 --> 00:02:42.800
second because this isn't quite as

66
00:02:41.18 --> 00:02:44.270
simple as it sounds other former

67
00:02:42.8 --> 00:02:46.010
communist countries like the Ukraine

68
00:02:44.27 --> 00:02:48.140
didn't have the same amount of luck and

69
00:02:46.01 --> 00:02:50.420
more than one investor invested in

70
00:02:48.14 --> 00:02:52.790
post-communist Ukraine has gone bankrupt

71
00:02:50.42 --> 00:02:54.260
before considering investing in Cuba

72
00:02:52.79 --> 00:02:55.820
it's important to understand what's

73
00:02:54.26 --> 00:02:57.410
going on in the country what is the

74
00:02:55.82 --> 00:02:59.330
nature of the reforms that are taking

75
00:02:57.41 --> 00:03:03.740
place but before we get into all of that

76
00:02:59.33 --> 00:03:04.760
let's take a look the situation Cuba

77
00:03:03.74 --> 00:03:06.920
today

78
00:03:04.76 --> 00:03:09.380
Cuba is a communist country this means

79
00:03:06.92 --> 00:03:11.810
that their whole economy is directed by

80
00:03:09.38 --> 00:03:13.900
the government for some clarity in the

81
00:03:11.81 --> 00:03:16.550
good times the Cuban government employed

82
00:03:13.9 --> 00:03:18.590
92 percent of the country's people this

83
00:03:16.55 --> 00:03:19.520
means that almost everyone was working

84
00:03:18.59 --> 00:03:22.220
in the public sector

85
00:03:19.52 --> 00:03:24.650
those were the 1980s when Cuba exported

86
00:03:22.22 --> 00:03:27.080
sugar tobacco and all sorts of fruit to

87
00:03:24.65 --> 00:03:29.420
the Soviet Union but in 1989 the Berlin

88
00:03:27.08 --> 00:03:30.420
Wall came down in Fidel Castro lost his

89
00:03:29.42 --> 00:03:32.020
trading partner

90
00:03:30.42 --> 00:03:34.600
[Music]

91
00:03:32.02 --> 00:03:36.310
passivist the US embargo which forbids

92
00:03:34.6 --> 00:03:38.560
American companies from doing any kind

93
00:03:36.31 --> 00:03:40.420
of business with the island and Cuba was

94
00:03:38.56 --> 00:03:42.310
practically isolated from the rest of

95
00:03:40.42 --> 00:03:44.440
the world this resulted in a brutal

96
00:03:42.31 --> 00:03:46.780
economic crisis that lasted until the

97
00:03:44.44 --> 00:03:48.940
year 2000 fist-width when sugar Shaban

98
00:03:46.78 --> 00:03:49.960
came to power in Venezuela as you could

99
00:03:48.94 --> 00:03:52.690
see in another one of our videos

100
00:03:49.96 --> 00:03:54.430
Venezuela used to be a very oily tree

101
00:03:52.69 --> 00:03:56.440
and since Chavez and Castro with such

102
00:03:54.43 --> 00:04:01.210
good buddies Chevelle's gave a lot of

103
00:03:56.44 --> 00:04:02.530
money to cap this was the life raft that

104
00:04:01.21 --> 00:04:05.440
was supporting Castro's revolution

105
00:04:02.53 --> 00:04:07.630
nevertheless in 2013 oil prices

106
00:04:05.44 --> 00:04:09.880
collapsed and so did Venezuela's economy

107
00:04:07.63 --> 00:04:12.040
and of course with all that money drying

108
00:04:09.88 --> 00:04:13.960
up in no longer went to Cuba and Cuba's

109
00:04:12.04 --> 00:04:15.790
economy collapsed as well now at this

110
00:04:13.96 --> 00:04:17.620
time Fidel was already retired and his

111
00:04:15.79 --> 00:04:19.720
brother Raul had taken the reins of the

112
00:04:17.62 --> 00:04:22.120
country Raul Castro realized that Cuba

113
00:04:19.72 --> 00:04:24.280
was once again isolated and he needed to

114
00:04:22.12 --> 00:04:30.610
change a lot of things or his country

115
00:04:24.28 --> 00:04:33.940
was going to get a whole lot worse Raul

116
00:04:30.61 --> 00:04:35.170
Castro Chinese reform by the way just I

117
00:04:33.94 --> 00:04:37.660
should say now if you're enjoying the

118
00:04:35.17 --> 00:04:38.560
music in today's video it's by a singer

119
00:04:37.66 --> 00:04:40.870
and composer called

120
00:04:38.56 --> 00:04:42.580
Rick belt Rik he's from Medellin

121

Colombia if you like it you will find

122
00:04:42.58 --> 00:04:45.810
links to his music in the description

[Music]

124
00:04:49.23 --> 00:04:53.340
beloved of Allah

125
00:04:54.46 --> 00:04:59.740
alright ok back to 2013 and Raul Castro

126
00:04:57.12 --> 00:05:01.689
announcing a series of reforms in Cuba

127
00:04:59.74 --> 00:05:03.909
the first reform was the legalization of

128
00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.159
something called the Quinta protesters

129
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.569
this is what we would call a free market

130
00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.310
and this meant that for the first time

131
00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.349
in Cubans could start small businesses

132
00:05:09.31 --> 00:05:13.360
now there would still be a lot of

133
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.800
restriction for example they still

134
00:05:13.36 --> 00:05:16.419
couldn't hire anybody and they could

135
00:05:14.8 --> 00:05:17.949
only start a business that was one of

136
00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.599
the types allowed by the government

137
00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.460
however in the three years since these

138
00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.069
became legal these freelancers are going

139
00:05:21.46 --> 00:05:27.969
to represent 10% of the Cuban workforce

140
00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.620
see see situation basically four people

141
00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.750
were afraid of doing anything private

142
00:05:29.62 --> 00:05:34.779
because government would take it away

143
00:05:31.75 --> 00:05:37.360
from that but now the government trusts

144
00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.949
the cuentapropistas because they are the

145
00:05:37.36 --> 00:05:41.139
future but still hold on a minute

146
00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.000
because there is more in fact Raul

147
00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.430
Castro seems to be following the Chinese

148
00:05:43.0 --> 00:05:46.810
Communist Party's playbook which by the

149
00:05:45.43 --> 00:05:48.099
way is going to be the topic of another

150
00:05:46.81 --> 00:05:50.050
video which we're going to be launching

151
00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.310
very soon actually in a very dung

152
00:05:50.05 --> 00:05:53.199
shopping style

153
00:05:51.31 --> 00:05:56.080
Ralph Castro has created his very own

154
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.050
special economic zone this is the so

155
00:05:56.08 --> 00:06:00.909
called marielle development zone so well

156
00:05:59.05 --> 00:06:02.919
what does this mean well inside this

157
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.719
zone foreign companies are allowed to

158
00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.789
start businesses they're allowed to hire

159
00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.830
local people and they're able to trade

160
00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.610
with less restrictions that exist in the

161
00:06:08.83 --> 00:06:11.610
rest of Cuba

162
00:06:12.23 --> 00:06:18.060
right foreign companies to Cuban and a

163
00:06:15.72 --> 00:06:20.580
mixed one are the first eight companies

164
00:06:18.06 --> 00:06:23.160
in the Meriel development zone which is

165
00:06:20.58 --> 00:06:23.760
to return the main economical center of

166
00:06:23.16 --> 00:06:25.470
Cuba

167
00:06:23.76 --> 00:06:27.570
now imagine wondering how is it possible

168
00:06:25.47 --> 00:06:30.090
some international companies such as the

169
00:06:27.57 --> 00:06:32.190
Spanish hotel chain barceló are able to

170
00:06:30.09 --> 00:06:34.110
operate in Cuba it's apparently the ban

171
00:06:32.19 --> 00:06:35.010
on foreign companies there well if

172
00:06:34.11 --> 00:06:36.390
you're watching this video from

173
00:06:35.01 --> 00:06:38.070
somewhere outside of the United States

174
00:06:36.39 --> 00:06:39.930
then you might well have traveled to

175
00:06:38.07 --> 00:06:40.950
have varner at some point if that's the

176
00:06:39.93 --> 00:06:42.930
case while you were there you were

177
00:06:40.95 --> 00:06:45.420
probably staying in a bar cellar or

178
00:06:42.93 --> 00:06:46.890
Amelia hotel both foreign companies so

179
00:06:45.42 --> 00:06:48.900
these Spanish companies have been

180
00:06:46.89 --> 00:06:53.430
operating in the country since the year

181
00:06:48.9 --> 00:06:55.230
2000 but the truth is in order to

182
00:06:53.43 --> 00:06:57.210
establish themselves on the island both

183
00:06:55.23 --> 00:06:59.520
of these companies have to partner with

184
00:06:57.21 --> 00:07:01.830
the Cuban government this means that the

185
00:06:59.52 --> 00:07:04.200
hotels are owned by the local government

186
00:07:01.83 --> 00:07:05.910
but the hotel chains have a license to

187
00:07:04.2 --> 00:07:08.250
operate them and they get a share of the

188
00:07:05.91 --> 00:07:10.650
profit so until now it was impossible to

189
00:07:08.25 --> 00:07:12.540
start a company in Cuba unless you were

190
00:07:10.65 --> 00:07:13.950
in partnership with the government so

191
00:07:12.54 --> 00:07:16.140
the creation of this special economic

192
00:07:13.95 --> 00:07:19.140
zone does show a clear trend a trend

193
00:07:16.14 --> 00:07:20.940
that China saw in the 1990s further to

194
00:07:19.14 --> 00:07:22.500
this there is a freeing up going on in

195
00:07:20.94 --> 00:07:25.230
the housing market in just two years

196
00:07:22.5 --> 00:07:27.270
over 40,000 new homes have been sold in

197
00:07:25.23 --> 00:07:28.830
Cuba now this doesn't exactly mean the

198
00:07:27.27 --> 00:07:31.050
Cubans have private property and the

199
00:07:28.83 --> 00:07:33.180
transactions do come with a bowels and

200
00:07:31.05 --> 00:07:37.520
restriction but it does highlight that

201
00:07:33.18 --> 00:07:37.520
there is a trend going on in the country

202
00:07:38.02 --> 00:07:42.430
that is another most important change in

203
00:07:40.9 --> 00:07:44.199
recent times with Obama's announcement

204
00:07:42.43 --> 00:07:46.060
that the trade embargo between the

205
00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:48.069
United States and Cuba was coming to an

206
00:07:46.06 --> 00:07:50.139
end the problem is is that still needs

207
00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:51.759
to be passed by the American Congress

208
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:53.500
and with Donald Trump being the next

209
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:54.970
president it's very difficult to predict

210
00:07:53.5 --> 00:07:57.009
exactly what's going to happen with that

211
00:07:54.97 --> 00:07:58.379
deal when he controlled by Donald Trump

made such undertakings illegal it's

221
00:08:18.15 --> 00:08:22.840
it's from worse keep the embargo with

222
00:08:20.77 --> 00:08:24.669
Cuba that's going to be bad news for

223
00:08:22.84 --> 00:08:26.440
investors who live in the United States

224
00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:27.789
they would lose out to investors who

come from other countries which don't

226
00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:35.140
have such restrictions Britain Australia

227
00:08:29.979 --> 00:08:36.279
Canada for example let a hold on a

228
00:08:35.14 --> 00:08:37.870
second because there's still no

229
00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:39.430
guarantee that Cuba's going to become

230
00:08:37.87 --> 00:08:41.620
some sort of free-market paradise

231

especially not overnight it's not really

232
00:08:41.62 --> 00:08:45.100
clear that even if you were legally

233
00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:46.089
allowed to invest in Cuba whether that's

234
00:08:45.1 --> 00:08:47.980
a good idea or not

in fact there are two potential

236
00:08:47.98 --> 00:08:51.550
scenarios that could play out here one

237
00:08:49.75 --> 00:08:53.020
option is that they follow the model of

238
00:08:51.55 --> 00:08:54.730
Czechoslovakia which is now two

239
00:08:53.02 --> 00:08:56.920
countries the Czech Republic and

240
00:08:54.73 --> 00:08:59.740
Slovakia or it's possible they follow

241
00:08:56.92 --> 00:09:01.270
the example of the Ukraine now let's

242
00:08:59.74 --> 00:09:02.290
have a look at these two very different

243
00:09:01.27 --> 00:09:05.089
examples

abandoned the communist based system but

there is a really big difference here

249
00:09:14.819 --> 00:09:19.079
the Czechs had a revolution called The

Velvet Revolution to overthrow their

meanwhile over in the Ukraine despite

256
00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:31.470
the fact that they've got their

257
00:09:29.31 --> 00:09:35.459
political independence they kept the

president Leonid croucher came from the

old Communist Party but this is not the

261
00:09:39.81 --> 00:09:43.769
end of our story just like Cuba Ukraine

262
00:09:41.79 --> 00:09:45.750
and Czechoslovakia have plans economies

263
00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:47.699
where all of the companies belongs to

up these economies to the wider world

266
00:09:49.44 --> 00:09:52.649
was privatization but and this is really

267
00:09:51.93 --> 00:09:55.259
important

268
00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:59.069
not all privatizations are created

269
00:09:55.259 --> 00:10:00.810
equally the Czechs to call it their

270
00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:03.360
biggest companies and made a calculation

271
00:10:00.81 --> 00:10:05.190
of the economic value then they divided

272
00:10:03.36 --> 00:10:07.860
the economic value of these countries

273
00:10:05.19 --> 00:10:09.779
into pouches if you were a Czech citizen

274
00:10:07.86 --> 00:10:12.029
you could buy one of these vouchers for

275
00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:14.069
a reasonable price something equal to

276
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:16.949
about a week's average salary this is

277
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:19.199
why 80% of the eligible population sport

278
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:21.480
in culture with this paper in your hand

279

00:10:21.48 --> 00:10:24.779
in the company in order to help those

who didn't know how to bid for the

282
00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:29.160
shares the Czech government encouraged

283
00:10:26.73 --> 00:10:31.410
the creation of hedge funds these hedge

284
00:10:29.16 --> 00:10:33.600
funds advise common citizens on how to

285
00:10:31.41 --> 00:10:35.040
invest intelligently a Czech citizen was

286
00:10:33.6 --> 00:10:37.170
able to go to one of these hedge funds

287
00:10:35.04 --> 00:10:40.920
and say I want to get some shares of

288
00:10:37.17 --> 00:10:43.510
this company and that one exception

289
00:10:40.92 --> 00:10:46.480
now as you can probably imagine there

290
00:10:43.51 --> 00:10:48.760
was a lot of corruption here but it also

291
00:10:46.48 --> 00:10:50.980
had a really positive outcome it helps

292
00:10:48.76 --> 00:10:53.140
the majority of Czechs to benefit from

293
00:10:50.98 --> 00:10:55.390
the privatization of these national

294
00:10:53.14 --> 00:10:57.430
company and the proof really is in the

295
00:10:55.39 --> 00:10:59.500
pudding here it's 25 years later and the

296
00:10:57.43 --> 00:11:01.839
Czech Republic is as egalitarian as

300
00:11:09.1 --> 00:11:12.709
but the story in Ukraine that's the

301
00:11:11.99 --> 00:11:14.360
different matter

302
00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:16.430
now the Ukraine did also tell these

303
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:18.410
vouchers to their citizens if you were a

304
00:11:16.43 --> 00:11:20.269
Ukrainian citizen you could bid for a

305
00:11:18.41 --> 00:11:22.519
voucher and eventually you were able to

306
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:23.959
use this voucher to buy some shares but

307
00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:25.730
the reality of the matter is that the

308
00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:27.589
government never got around to arranging

309
00:11:25.73 --> 00:11:29.690
those auction it only really happened

310
00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:31.579
with the smallest and worst of Ukraine's

311
00:11:29.69 --> 00:11:33.680
companies and the Ukrainians were left

312
00:11:31.579 --> 00:11:35.690
waiting for years they have their

313
00:11:33.68 --> 00:11:37.250
vouchers in hand that they weren't able

314
00:11:35.69 --> 00:11:38.779
to do anything useful with them and

315
00:11:37.25 --> 00:11:41.060
unfortunately during this same time

316
00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:42.860
Ukraine was also suffering from record

317
00:11:41.06 --> 00:11:46.040
inflation when purchased these vouchers

318
00:11:42.86 --> 00:11:47.300
would cost 1,500 American dollars but

319
00:11:46.04 --> 00:11:49.100
some years later they were being

320
00:11:47.3 --> 00:11:52.910
exchanged on the black market for as

321
00:11:49.1 --> 00:11:54.829
little as ten US dollars so the average

322
00:11:52.91 --> 00:11:56.930
Ukrainian would be sitting at home and

323
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:59.300
then oligarch would come knocking and

324
00:11:56.93 --> 00:12:00.829
he'd say something like whoa what are

325
00:11:59.3 --> 00:12:02.510
you going to do with that voucher it's

326
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:05.180
never going to be worth anything to you

327
00:12:02.51 --> 00:12:06.529
tell you what you give it to me and I'll

328
00:12:05.18 --> 00:12:09.290
give you some money that you can

329
00:12:06.529 --> 00:12:10.940
actually use and surprise surprise soon

330
00:12:09.29 --> 00:12:13.339
enough all of the vouchers were in the

331
00:12:10.94 --> 00:12:15.680
hands of the oligarch and there's no

332
00:12:13.339 --> 00:12:17.389
prizes for guessing here that yes the

333
00:12:15.68 --> 00:12:19.069
oligarchs did have some pretty close

334
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:20.660
connections to the government who then

335
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:21.290

00:12:20.66 --> 00:12:24.410
companies

sold and that is why Ukraine still has

341
00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:35.580
to go through some privatization but the

342
00:12:34.11 --> 00:12:39.329
most important thing to bear in mind

343
00:12:35.58 --> 00:12:41.399
here is that in present-day Ukraine 85%

344
00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:43.829
of the country's wealth is in the hands

345
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:46.230
of the 50 wealthiest oligarchs the

346
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:48.480
result is no political stability and a

347
00:12:46.23 --> 00:12:50.399
horrific environment for investing oh

348
00:12:48.48 --> 00:12:52.890
and that's not to mention the whole war

349
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:54.660
with Russia thing so if an investor is

350
00:12:52.89 --> 00:12:56.910
bought a property in Kiev ten years ago

351
00:12:54.66 --> 00:13:00.380
they might just be banging their head

352
00:12:56.91 --> 00:13:00.380
against the wall right about now

353
00:13:01.1 --> 00:13:04.180
all right so let's go back to Cuba here

354
00:13:03.02 --> 00:13:06.260
we have some things that resemble

355
00:13:04.18 --> 00:13:08.690
Czechoslovakia and we have some things

356
00:13:06.26 --> 00:13:10.760
that resemble Ukraine for example in the

357
00:13:08.69 --> 00:13:13.820
US you have two million Cubans living

358
00:13:10.76 --> 00:13:16.040
this represents 20% of the entire Cuban

359
00:13:13.82 --> 00:13:18.230
population these Cuban Americans have

360
00:13:16.04 --> 00:13:20.150
been educated in a democratic system and

361
00:13:18.23 --> 00:13:24.260
this could help build good democratic

362
00:13:20.15 --> 00:13:25.820
institutions in Cuba if this does show

363
00:13:24.26 --> 00:13:27.710
itself to be the case saying Kubik has

364
00:13:25.82 --> 00:13:30.140
become a placed with rule of law civil

365
00:13:27.71 --> 00:13:35.000
rights and many opportunities for Cubans

366
00:13:30.14 --> 00:13:36.560
to lift themselves out of poverty so now

367
00:13:35.0 --> 00:13:38.750
that we've given you the rundown on Cuba

368
00:13:36.56 --> 00:13:40.850

369
00:13:38.75 --> 00:13:41.930
know yours what do you think is going to

370
00:13:40.85 --> 00:13:43.730
happen in Cuba do you think they'll

371
00:13:41.93 --> 00:13:45.860
follow the path of the Czech Republic or
