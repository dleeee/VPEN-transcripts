00:00:00.11 --> 00:00:03.320
[Applause]

2
00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.550
the far-right and Germany are two things

3
00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.349
that sound pretty scary when you put

4
00:00:11.55 --> 00:00:15.330
them together this is why even though

5
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.400
Angela Merkel has won the elections with

6
00:00:15.33 --> 00:00:19.529
a high margin it has been a bittersweet

7
00:00:17.4 --> 00:00:21.330
victory the fact that alternative for

8
00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.800
Germany a xenophobic ultra conservative

9
00:00:21.33 --> 00:00:24.930
party has become the third largest

10
00:00:22.8 --> 00:00:28.410
political force is bad enough to make

11
00:00:24.93 --> 00:00:29.310
Merkel rather uneasy we don't need to

12
00:00:28.41 --> 00:00:31.260
beat around the bush

13
00:00:29.31 --> 00:00:33.630
we wanted a better result that is clear

14
00:00:31.26 --> 00:00:35.550
Angela Merkel era visual politic we plan

15
00:00:33.63 --> 00:00:37.530
to do a video this week about Germany

16
00:00:35.55 --> 00:00:39.270
but the current news Forrester snoopers

17
00:00:37.53 --> 00:00:41.309
phone that video so we could have time

18
00:00:39.27 --> 00:00:43.620
to prepare this one explaining what

19
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
alternative for journey or AFD as it's

20
00:00:43.62 --> 00:00:47.640
known in Germany is all about and yes I

21
00:00:46.2 --> 00:00:48.989
probably know what you're thinking right

22
00:00:47.64 --> 00:00:51.329
now you're probably thinking come on

23
00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.640
Simon how could you not predict that the

24
00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.750
far-right would be a big hit in Germany

25
00:00:53.64 --> 00:00:56.190
because well at the end of the day

26
00:00:54.75 --> 00:00:58.980
xenophobic parties they're pretty much

27
00:00:56.19 --> 00:01:00.629
in fashion all across Europe plus aft

28
00:00:58.98 --> 00:01:02.990
you did great in previous local

29
00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.460
elections

30
00:01:02.99 --> 00:01:09.410
[Music]

31
00:01:06.46 --> 00:01:11.479
nevertheless most of the polls said that

32
00:01:09.41 --> 00:01:13.580
Germans love moderation above all else

33
00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.710
and that's not just the electoral polls

34
00:01:13.58 --> 00:01:18.080
talking but also sociological studies

35
00:01:15.71 --> 00:01:19.910
for instance while in France only 50% of

36
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:21.560
the population places themselves on the

37
00:01:19.91 --> 00:01:24.410
center of the spectrum this number in

38
00:01:21.56 --> 00:01:26.540
Germany is as high as 76% further

39
00:01:24.41 --> 00:01:28.820
Germans have many reasons to be happy

40
00:01:26.54 --> 00:01:30.800
they almost didn't suffer at all during

41
00:01:28.82 --> 00:01:32.510
the economic crisis and now that our

42
00:01:30.8 --> 00:01:34.100
economy is doing better than ever

43
00:01:32.51 --> 00:01:36.080
salaries are rising there's almost full

44
00:01:34.1 --> 00:01:38.180
employment and companies export abroad

45
00:01:36.08 --> 00:01:40.430
as if there was no tomorrow

46
00:01:38.18 --> 00:01:42.590
so the big question here becomes who

47
00:01:40.43 --> 00:01:44.630
votes for the far right wing in Germany

48
00:01:42.59 --> 00:01:46.729
and most important of all what does

49
00:01:44.63 --> 00:01:48.979
alternative for Germany what are they

50
00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.899
really a radical party or is the media

51
00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.060
exaggerating well today we're going to

52
00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.950
answer all of those questions but as

53
00:01:53.06 --> 00:01:59.180
usual before we get started let's have a

54
00:01:54.95 --> 00:02:01.700
look at the history a party on the

55
00:01:59.18 --> 00:02:03.350
divide yes it is true today alternative

56
00:02:01.7 --> 00:02:05.539
for Germany they are a populist

57
00:02:03.35 --> 00:02:07.209
political party with a big focus on

58
00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.290
rejecting immigrants and refugees

59
00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.510
specifically they want to reject those

60
00:02:09.29 --> 00:02:14.000
who come from Islamic countries but

61
00:02:11.51 --> 00:02:15.650
despite all of this its origins couldn't

62
00:02:14.0 --> 00:02:18.260
be more different than what it is today

63
00:02:15.65 --> 00:02:20.269
let's go back to the year 2013

64
00:02:18.26 --> 00:02:22.160
now back then all the European media

65
00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.630
talked about was the debt crisis that

66
00:02:22.16 --> 00:02:26.750
was happening in countries like Spain

67
00:02:23.63 --> 00:02:28.580
Italy and especially Greece now in case

68
00:02:26.75 --> 00:02:33.920
you don't know the history here let's a

69
00:02:28.58 --> 00:02:36.290
quick summary before 2008 German banks

70
00:02:33.92 --> 00:02:37.700
invested a lot of money in lending to

71
00:02:36.29 --> 00:02:39.739
companies and governments in the south

72
00:02:37.7 --> 00:02:42.140
of Europe and after the financial crisis

73
00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.769
of 2008 these countries couldn't give

74
00:02:42.14 --> 00:02:44.780
the money back

75
00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.100
in fact they needed even more cash so

76
00:02:44.78 --> 00:02:48.230
that they could afford their current

77
00:02:46.1 --> 00:02:50.630
spending this included things like the

78
00:02:48.23 --> 00:02:52.970
salaries of civil servants highways and

79
00:02:50.63 --> 00:02:55.310
hospitals and as you can imagine paying

80
00:02:52.97 --> 00:02:56.970
day-to-day spending with debt it's a far

81
00:02:55.31 --> 00:02:58.970
from ideal situation

82
00:02:56.97 --> 00:03:01.410
[Applause]

83
00:02:58.97 --> 00:03:02.940
so this is where Angela Merkel comes

84
00:03:01.41 --> 00:03:04.650
along and says all right guys

85
00:03:02.94 --> 00:03:06.390
I'm going to lend you the money I will

86
00:03:04.65 --> 00:03:08.670
even let you give it back whenever you

87
00:03:06.39 --> 00:03:12.030
want but you've got to make some reforms

88
00:03:08.67 --> 00:03:14.220
your economic systems these reforms they

89
00:03:12.03 --> 00:03:15.780
were known as austerity Germany along

90
00:03:14.22 --> 00:03:17.760
side with other northern European

91
00:03:15.78 --> 00:03:19.740
countries wanted to lend money to Italy

92
00:03:17.76 --> 00:03:22.110
Spain and Greece while at the same time

93
00:03:19.74 --> 00:03:24.270
demanding some budget cuts so that these

94
00:03:22.11 --> 00:03:26.610
countries would no longer need to borrow

95
00:03:24.27 --> 00:03:28.200
as much money in the future and so that

96
00:03:26.61 --> 00:03:29.520
they could pay back their debts those

97
00:03:28.2 --> 00:03:31.500
conditions they were seen as pretty

98
00:03:29.52 --> 00:03:33.330
draconian by most of those southern

99
00:03:31.5 --> 00:03:35.220
European countries they were asking the

100
00:03:33.33 --> 00:03:37.020
question what who's Germany to tell us

101
00:03:35.22 --> 00:03:38.670
how we should spend our money meanwhile

102
00:03:37.02 --> 00:03:40.050
some Germans they were also pretty mad

103
00:03:38.67 --> 00:03:41.820
at their governments I mean they were

104
00:03:40.05 --> 00:03:43.380
thinking who are you Merkel to go around

105
00:03:41.82 --> 00:03:48.480
giving money to everyone this is the

106
00:03:43.38 --> 00:03:50.070
European Union not an NGO now among

107
00:03:48.48 --> 00:03:53.310
those angry Germans there were three

108
00:03:50.07 --> 00:03:55.740
famous economists Alexander Gowland Bern

109
00:03:53.31 --> 00:03:57.270
luck and Conrad Adam these were the

110
00:03:55.74 --> 00:03:59.910
founders of the party electoral

111
00:03:57.27 --> 00:04:02.040
alternative 2013 which would later

112
00:03:59.91 --> 00:04:04.020
become alternative for Germany many of

113
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:06.180
these first supporters were bankers and

114
00:04:04.02 --> 00:04:08.130
university professors from the western

115
00:04:06.18 --> 00:04:10.110
part of Germany cities like Frankfurt

116
00:04:08.13 --> 00:04:11.640
Cologne and Bonn and do you remember

117
00:04:10.11 --> 00:04:14.630
this because it's going to become really

118
00:04:11.64 --> 00:04:14.630
important later on

119
00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.959
now in their electoral manifesto they

120
00:04:19.13 --> 00:04:23.480
suggested that Germany should leave the

121
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.190
euro and go back to the German mark and

122
00:04:23.48 --> 00:04:26.389
swell why was that well this is because

123
00:04:25.19 --> 00:04:28.639
they believed that they could avoid

124
00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.830
bailouts to poorer economies by doing so

125
00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.780
and even more importantly they could

126
00:04:30.83 --> 00:04:35.090
protect their economy from a likely

127
00:04:32.78 --> 00:04:36.889
devaluation of the euro as we've said in

128
00:04:35.09 --> 00:04:40.570
previous videos Germany's success was

129
00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.570
partly due to their strong currency

130
00:04:42.6 --> 00:04:47.080
but Spain and Greece they were pushing

131
00:04:45.34 --> 00:04:49.120
the European Central Bank to print more

132
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:51.340
money so that they could pay their debts

133
00:04:49.12 --> 00:04:53.680
back and as you probably know economists

134
00:04:51.34 --> 00:04:55.810
they thought that was a pretty bad idea

135
00:04:53.68 --> 00:04:57.700
the first stereotypical AFD voters

136
00:04:55.81 --> 00:04:59.530
weren't like the stereotype of an

137
00:04:57.7 --> 00:05:01.690
extreme right-wing hooligan they were

138
00:04:59.53 --> 00:05:03.850
considered to be businessmen economists

139
00:05:01.69 --> 00:05:05.560
and university teachers this is why the

140
00:05:03.85 --> 00:05:07.090
media started calling this party that

141
00:05:05.56 --> 00:05:09.370
quote teachers party and why they

142
00:05:07.09 --> 00:05:12.070
couldn't win a single MP during the

143
00:05:09.37 --> 00:05:14.230
federal elections of 2013 I mean think

144
00:05:12.07 --> 00:05:16.720
about it monetary policy is not exactly

145
00:05:14.23 --> 00:05:18.700
a sexy topic for an electoral campaign I

146
00:05:16.72 --> 00:05:20.320
mean pretty much only you guys who are

147
00:05:18.7 --> 00:05:22.800
watching this video care about that kind

148
00:05:20.32 --> 00:05:22.800
of topic

149
00:05:25.38 --> 00:05:30.660
nonetheless the fate of alternative for

150
00:05:27.51 --> 00:05:32.970
Germany was to change in July of 2015 at

151
00:05:30.66 --> 00:05:34.650
that moment the Economist Bern La Crosse

152
00:05:32.97 --> 00:05:37.320
the Chairman bar to the brand new leader

153
00:05:34.65 --> 00:05:39.120
Frau Petri she had other plans unlike

154
00:05:37.32 --> 00:05:41.280
the previous leaders Petri came from the

155
00:05:39.12 --> 00:05:43.650
eastern part of the country and this

156
00:05:41.28 --> 00:05:45.570
means she brought a totally different

157
00:05:43.65 --> 00:05:47.750
political culture for her monetary

158
00:05:45.57 --> 00:05:50.910
policy deficit and fiscal responsibility

159
00:05:47.75 --> 00:05:52.770
wasn't really that important instead she

160
00:05:50.91 --> 00:05:54.900
knew there was the big nish of voters

161
00:05:52.77 --> 00:05:57.330
who wanted an iron fist on things like

162
00:05:54.9 --> 00:05:59.190
immigration and national identity

163
00:05:57.33 --> 00:06:00.570
besides these kind of suggestions would

164
00:05:59.19 --> 00:06:02.400
give her the support of other leaders

165
00:06:00.57 --> 00:06:04.230
like Nigel Faraj from Britain see you

166
00:06:02.4 --> 00:06:06.180
Kipp party marine lepen from the

167
00:06:04.23 --> 00:06:07.830
National Front in France and of course

168
00:06:06.18 --> 00:06:10.290
our favourite politician than the visual

169
00:06:07.83 --> 00:06:12.450
politic mascot yes might have you of

170
00:06:10.29 --> 00:06:17.220
course we are talking about the one and

171
00:06:12.45 --> 00:06:21.680
only leader of Germany's far right-wing

party meets Putin allies in Moscow

173
00:06:23.27 --> 00:06:27.980
I know I know dad Amir footin is an ever

174
00:06:26.03 --> 00:06:30.200
popular topic here at visual politic but

175
00:06:27.98 --> 00:06:32.300
I mean how could we resist talking about

176
00:06:30.2 --> 00:06:34.460
him now during this time thousands of

177
00:06:32.3 --> 00:06:36.740
refugees from Syria Iraq and Libya they

178
00:06:34.46 --> 00:06:39.500
came to Germany and Angela Merkel she

179
00:06:36.74 --> 00:06:41.720
welcomes them with arms wide open and

180
00:06:39.5 --> 00:06:43.940
well some Germans they didn't really

181
00:06:41.72 --> 00:06:46.760
like this so in the regional elections

182
00:06:43.94 --> 00:06:49.130
of 2016 alternative for Germany launched

183
00:06:46.76 --> 00:06:50.870
an electoral platform which had nothing

184
00:06:49.13 --> 00:06:52.850
to do with what the founders had in mind

185
00:06:50.87 --> 00:06:55.190
at the beginning this is why many of

186
00:06:52.85 --> 00:06:56.780
those economists they jumped ship among

187
00:06:55.19 --> 00:06:57.970
them burn luck who was the first

191
00:07:01.11 --> 00:07:05.100
this party has fallen irretrievably into

192
00:07:04.2 --> 00:07:07.140
the wrong hands

193
00:07:05.1 --> 00:07:09.000
ban Luka since then alternative for

194
00:07:07.14 --> 00:07:10.950
Germany has had two factions fighting

195
00:07:09.0 --> 00:07:12.570
each other on the one hand we have the

196
00:07:10.95 --> 00:07:14.340
people left over from the first group

197
00:07:12.57 --> 00:07:15.930
but they are less and less important

198
00:07:14.34 --> 00:07:17.700
everyday and on the other hand we have

199
00:07:15.93 --> 00:07:20.310
those who came under the leadership of

200
00:07:17.7 --> 00:07:21.840
Frau Petri this new political structure

201
00:07:20.31 --> 00:07:25.250
it does mean more voters but it also

202
00:07:21.84 --> 00:07:25.250
means more problems

203
00:07:25.53 --> 00:07:30.000
the f t's current crisis was triggered

204
00:07:28.11 --> 00:07:32.220
in mid-january through a taboo breaking

205
00:07:30.0 --> 00:07:33.930
speech by right-winger bjorn hookah who

206
00:07:32.22 --> 00:07:35.970
in a beer hall in dresden called for a

207
00:07:33.93 --> 00:07:37.740
hundred eighty degree turn in germany's

208
00:07:35.97 --> 00:07:39.900
culture of remembering and atoning for

209
00:07:37.74 --> 00:07:41.340
the nazi era regardless of how far

210
00:07:39.9 --> 00:07:42.750
right-wing you want to be these kind of

211
00:07:41.34 --> 00:07:45.240
things they're not really cool in

212
00:07:42.75 --> 00:07:46.710
Germany and this created many problems

213
00:07:45.24 --> 00:07:48.720
for mrs. Petri there are some

214
00:07:46.71 --> 00:07:50.940
investigations open because apparently

215
00:07:48.72 --> 00:07:53.400
some of the proposals on her program

216
00:07:50.94 --> 00:07:56.610
might be illegal remember that German

217
00:07:53.4 --> 00:07:58.770
law is made to avoid any resurgence of

218
00:07:56.61 --> 00:08:01.200
Nazism the issues in this party are big

219
00:07:58.77 --> 00:08:03.690
enough that even Frau Pech RIA herself

220
00:08:01.2 --> 00:08:06.330
had to resign one day after this last

221
00:08:03.69 --> 00:08:09.729
election due to infighting with some of

222
00:08:06.33 --> 00:08:11.949
the more extreme factions of the party

223
00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:13.779
nevertheless with or without the

224
00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.639
unfortunate weights and the internal

225
00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:17.139
division alternative for Germany has

226
00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:20.229
become the big surprise from this

227
00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:22.360
election so the question now becomes who

228
00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:24.500
voted for them well let's take a look at

229
00:08:22.36 --> 00:08:26.699
this

230
00:08:24.5 --> 00:08:29.590

history of two Germany's for the past

232
00:08:29.59 --> 00:08:34.329
few years the German economy has been on

233
00:08:31.93 --> 00:08:36.459
fire salaries are growing companies are

234
00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:37.630
exporting and inequality is almost

235
00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:39.940
non-existent

236
00:08:37.63 --> 00:08:42.070
well actually just hold on familiar

237
00:08:39.94 --> 00:08:44.649
because that last that it's not exactly

238
00:08:42.07 --> 00:08:46.000
sure now of course there is almost no

239
00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.890
poverty on the streets and there are

240
00:08:46.0 --> 00:08:49.779
factories all over the country but when

241
00:08:47.89 --> 00:08:52.779
we look at the income distribution by

242
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:54.519
regions do you see a clear division if

243
00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:57.770
you pay attention to this map you'll see

244
00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:03.610
a blue part and a red part

[Music]

246
00:09:03.71 --> 00:09:08.330
the blue part is the wealthiest the red

247
00:09:06.11 --> 00:09:10.850
part is the poorest the blue part is

248
00:09:08.33 --> 00:09:12.770
what used to be Western Germany and the

249
00:09:10.85 --> 00:09:14.960
red part is what used to be eastern

250
00:09:12.77 --> 00:09:16.250
Germany communist Germany that eastern

251
00:09:14.96 --> 00:09:18.649
part of the country is the Germany that

252
00:09:16.25 --> 00:09:20.330
went capitalist in 1989 but still

253
00:09:18.649 --> 00:09:22.370
doesn't have the same standard of living

254
00:09:20.33 --> 00:09:24.260
as the West if you visit a city like

255
00:09:22.37 --> 00:09:26.540
Dresden in eastern Germany you will see

256
00:09:24.26 --> 00:09:28.040
lots of construction going on most of

257
00:09:26.54 --> 00:09:29.540
the buildings they were completed just a

258
00:09:28.04 --> 00:09:31.580
couple of years ago this is indicative

259
00:09:29.54 --> 00:09:34.010
that the reunification of Germany is

260
00:09:31.58 --> 00:09:35.720
still very much an ongoing process now

261
00:09:34.01 --> 00:09:37.490
of course if we compare the standard of

262
00:09:35.72 --> 00:09:39.860
living of an Eastern German with a creek

263
00:09:37.49 --> 00:09:41.839
or a Spaniard it doesn't look that bad

264
00:09:39.86 --> 00:09:44.810
but Germans they like to be compared

265
00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:47.270
with other Germans and when you do that

266
00:09:44.81 --> 00:09:49.339
things look way worse Schmidt doesn't

267
00:09:47.27 --> 00:09:51.950
have enough industrial opportunity and

268
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:54.410
it lacks proper educational facilities a

269
00:09:51.95 --> 00:09:56.000
large sport and cultural center aren't

270
00:09:54.41 --> 00:09:58.700
enough to keep people from leaving the

271
00:09:56.0 --> 00:10:00.920
city it's dead quiet in the town centre

272
00:09:58.7 --> 00:10:04.580
young people have left in droves for

273
00:10:00.92 --> 00:10:05.990
bigger cities in the West a sculpture on

274
00:10:04.58 --> 00:10:08.029
the riverbank mirrors the city's

275
00:10:05.99 --> 00:10:10.100
troubled hopes for the future in this

276
00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:12.440
city the city of chouette alternative

277
00:10:10.1 --> 00:10:14.240
for Germany got over 20% of the votes

278
00:10:12.44 --> 00:10:16.790
and a little further south in the state

279
00:10:14.24 --> 00:10:18.529
of Saxony most people are voting for the

280
00:10:16.79 --> 00:10:19.850
far-right but hold on a minute because

281
00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:21.740
we're not just talking about the economy

282
00:10:19.85 --> 00:10:23.660
here we're talking about the totally

283
00:10:21.74 --> 00:10:25.610
different culture think about it

284
00:10:23.66 --> 00:10:28.100
East Germans lived for entire

285
00:10:25.61 --> 00:10:30.110
generations under a totally different

286
00:10:28.1 --> 00:10:31.940
political system this means a different

287
00:10:30.11 --> 00:10:35.060
education a different lifestyle and

288
00:10:31.94 --> 00:10:36.110
different values here moderation it's

289
00:10:35.06 --> 00:10:38.209
not really a good thing

290
00:10:36.11 --> 00:10:42.700
in fact the left-wing party Die Linke er

291
00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:42.700
gets most of its votes in eastern Berlin

292
00:10:43.21 --> 00:10:47.300
but there's more than that well Western

293
00:10:45.5 --> 00:10:48.950
Germans spent decades remembering their

294
00:10:47.3 --> 00:10:50.930
Nazi past the government of the

295
00:10:48.95 --> 00:10:53.690
Democratic Republic of Germany tried to

296
00:10:50.93 --> 00:10:55.370
create a new sense of national pride so

297
00:10:53.69 --> 00:10:56.810
when an aft candidate says that we must

298
00:10:55.37 --> 00:10:58.700
appreciate the courage of the German

299
00:10:56.81 --> 00:11:01.010
soldiers during World War two Germans

300
00:10:58.7 --> 00:11:03.530
from Cologne are frightened but Germans

301
00:11:01.01 --> 00:11:05.000
from Leipzig say well okay whatever all

302
00:11:03.53 --> 00:11:07.070
right but now there is a really

303
00:11:05.0 --> 00:11:09.320
important question why is eastern

304
00:11:07.07 --> 00:11:11.540
Germany is so much against refugees and

305
00:11:09.32 --> 00:11:12.770
immigrants well many of you might think

306
00:11:11.54 --> 00:11:14.420
this is because they are tired of

307
00:11:12.77 --> 00:11:16.760
Muslims who don't want to integrate into

308
00:11:14.42 --> 00:11:18.590
their culture right well here comes a

309
00:11:16.76 --> 00:11:19.520
number that is going to absolutely blow

310
00:11:18.59 --> 00:11:21.320
your mind

311
00:11:19.52 --> 00:11:24.710
there aren't 9 million immigrants living

312
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:26.310
in Germany at less than 500,000 live in

313
00:11:24.71 --> 00:11:29.480
East Germany

314
00:11:26.31 --> 00:11:31.130
[Music]

315
00:11:29.48 --> 00:11:32.900
and when you really think about it this

316
00:11:31.13 --> 00:11:34.280
makes total sense I mean those who moved

317
00:11:32.9 --> 00:11:36.440
to Germany they want to be in the

318
00:11:34.28 --> 00:11:37.760
wealthiest regions so if you walk down

319
00:11:36.44 --> 00:11:39.290
the streets of Dresden you're hardly

320
00:11:37.76 --> 00:11:41.330
ever going to see a woman covering her

321
00:11:39.29 --> 00:11:42.800
head with a hijab and then guess who is

322
00:11:41.33 --> 00:11:44.540
the biggest immigrant community in

323
00:11:42.8 --> 00:11:46.460
eastern Germany while surprise surprise

324
00:11:44.54 --> 00:11:47.810
that would be the Russians more than

325
00:11:46.46 --> 00:11:49.700
half of the immigrants living on this

326
00:11:47.81 --> 00:11:51.440
side of the country come from the lands

327
00:11:49.7 --> 00:11:53.210
of Putin and of course they are the

328
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:57.760
biggest audience for German Russia today

329
00:11:53.21 --> 00:12:00.860
and well this explains things like this

330
00:11:57.76 --> 00:12:02.900
AFD deploys double-headed eagle to snare

331
00:12:00.86 --> 00:12:04.160
russian german voters so now the

332
00:12:02.9 --> 00:12:06.050
question becomes do you think

333
00:12:04.16 --> 00:12:07.670
alternative for Germany can keep growing

334
00:12:06.05 --> 00:12:09.590
in the next election or will its

335
00:12:07.67 --> 00:12:11.150
internal divisions end up destroying the

336
00:12:09.59 --> 00:12:12.380
party and what do you think this party

337
00:12:11.15 --> 00:12:14.630
can achieve over the next four years

338
00:12:12.38 --> 00:12:15.470
