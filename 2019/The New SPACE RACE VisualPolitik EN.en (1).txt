3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,750
human beings have been wanting to know

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,340
where they came from for centuries how

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,140
everything around them was created and

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,029
how to expand their borders into the

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,770
unknown

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,330
despite this space continues to be a

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,790
hostile and unknown environments it's

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,710
perhaps the last on conquered territory

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,960
we need to delve into but dear viewer in

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,239
the last century or more specifically in

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,430
the last five or six decades spaces

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,809
gradually become an increasingly

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,030
familiar and it has to be said a more

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,059
accessible place and the fundamental

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,780
question is well why human beings took

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,310
the great leap into space in the late

19
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,350
1950s when the United States and the

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,210
Soviet Union began a long and pretty

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,730
rough space race in a bid to get one up

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,829
on their adversary this is a story we

23
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:02,730
all know quite well

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,260
[Music]

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,480
what we probably don't know so well is

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,370
the extent to which this competition

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,480
between the two great superpowers

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,340
contributed to scientific and

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,140
technological development in general

30
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,940
basically these two great powers have to

31
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,950
invest so much money and so many

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,900
resources in the space race that's in

33
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,550
addition to the that same moral

34
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,260
superiority of being the first to

35
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,580
conquer space it's brought great

36
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,380
scientific technological and military

37
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,520
advances yes military don't think for a

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,560
second that the space race was merely an

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,080
exercise in scientific enlightenment not

40
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,480
at all

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,490
[Music]

42
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,450
the fact is that with the end of the

43
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,920
Cold War and the fall of the communist

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,930
bloc things began to change former

45
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,970
Soviet countries ran out of money and

46
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,920
the United States gradually began to

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,500
devote less and less of their budget to

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,300
space in fact the percentage of federal

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,430
spending dedicated to the space race has

50
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,500
dropped by more than 50 percent since

51
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,660
1991

52
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,689
[Music]

53
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,310
so there was no real competition

54
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,619
governments especially the US as we've

55
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,930
just seen began to lose interest in

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,790
space the race for dominance when it

57
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,090
came crashing back to earth and that

58
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,799
paved the way for private companies to

59
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,780
become more and more involved

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,800
[Music]

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,960
right now more than a dozen private

62
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,400
companies are developing rockets to

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,380
launch objects into space satellites

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,880
supplies for the international space

you've probably heard of SpaceX Virgin

Galactic Blue Origin and others and this

69
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,780
brings up some questions is a huge new

70
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,670
market in space exploration in the

71
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,680
process of being created could the

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,989
future of humans in space really develop

73
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:56,670
through the private sector if so what

74
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,870
will happen to the government's agencies

75
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,090
all they'd be able to coexist with

76
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,070
private companies

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,510
[Music]

78
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,150
change of players as you will know

79
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,430
during the 20th century space conquests

80
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,620
basically involved two main players the

81
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,940
United States and the Soviet Union

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,310
tackled the challenge by investing vast

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,530
amounts of money

84
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,600
to give you an idea on just the Apollo

85
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,460
program alone in the United States been

86
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,710
more than 110 billion dollars in today's

87
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,510
money that's a hundred and ten billion

88
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,130
dollars on a program that employed more

89
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:40,220
than 400,000 people

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,470
at that time the aerospace sector was so

91
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,030
important that the US government soon

92
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,250
took over almost absolute control of all

93
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,940
space projects

94
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,760
in 1967 the United States the Soviet

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,650
Union and the United Kingdom agreed on

96
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,330
the Outer Space Treaty a treaty that

97
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,950
among other things established the

98
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,900
responsibility of governments over every

99
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,240
activity undertaken by non-governmental

100
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,700
aerospace entities that is that every

101
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,380
company or any other private aerospace

102
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,420
entity was subordinate to their

103
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,730
country's government

104
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,610
in practice this meant that any private

105
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,739
business project had to be explicitly

106
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,750
approved by the company's nation of

107
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,730
origin and not only that as the state

108
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,139
was ultimately responsible for the

109
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,940
company's actions in the end the

110
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,070
direction of every project was in the

111
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,690
hands of politicians and officials

112
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,639
ultimately it was the government who

113
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,950
approved the day-to-day operations at

114
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,979
the aerospace companies

115
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,449
what's more this treaty is still

116
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,280
enforced today however due to the fact

117
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,199
that the space race has lost steam in

118
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,150
international affairs the application of

119
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,759
the treaty is just less strict thanks to

120
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,650
this the private aerospace sector has

121
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,770
gained more and more freedom

122
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,950
[Music]

123
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,740
and this is hugely significant you see

124
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,360
for some years the space race has been

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,370
warming up again and is enjoying a bit

126
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,020
of a golden era and this is happening

127
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,790
due to one fundamental reason the

128
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:11,270
reduction of entry barriers this is

129
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,980
something we've all experienced on a

130
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,390
smaller scale in recent decades

131
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,430
technology has become cheaper and the

132
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,320
capabilities of our devices have taken

133
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,570
an exponential leap all this has led us

134
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,760
to think about the aerospace area as

135
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:30,080
much more accessible think about it for

136
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
a moment a supercomputer from the 90s

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,590
which could only be accessed by

138
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,450
governments and huge multinationals

139
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,920
after paying millions for the privilege

140
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,870
we have the computing power of an iPhone

141
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,060
6 and this explains why more and more

142
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,680
countries now have their own space

143
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,050
programs and space agencies and we're

144
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,970
not just talking about super powers like

145
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,950
China who are joining the new space race

146
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,600
by storming through the front door but

147
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,580
also much less powerful countries like

148
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,070
Ghana yep that's right even Ghana has a

149
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,380
space agency

150
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,060
[Music]

151
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,160
but the real shake-up in this new race

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,930
is that it's not government's pulling

153
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,280
the strings anymore but rather private

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,320
companies and this is a paradigm shift

155
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,180
now that we have more governments and

156
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,730
more especially new companies involved a

157
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,280
question is we on the verge of seeing an

158
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,190
even more exciting space race his

159
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,840
rayleigh company sends world's first

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,230
privately funded mission to moon

success in india's second attempt at

launching moon mission to give you an

164
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,780
idea new aerospace companies such as

165
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,730
spacex can offer launches to earth's

166
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,250
orbit around sixty million dollars and

167
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,230
that may sound like a lot but if you

168
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,970
compare it with the almost 500 million

169
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,320
that it costs to launch the space

170
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,880
shuttle it sounds like a bit of a

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,820
bargain and it's precisely this

172
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,550
efficiency in the costs and resources of

173
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,260
the private aerospace industry which has

174
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,910
led governments to give up on doing the

175
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,680
work themselves and become customers

176
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,540
instead governments and our customers of

177
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,190
private aerospace companies that work

178
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,180
autonomously

[Music]

180
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,150
obviously private agencies such as NASA

181
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,550
have had private suppliers since day one

182
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,470
just as the army or the Air Force do

183
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,420
that's pretty clear but let's not skip

184
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,250
over this detail it's one thing to

185
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,570
manufacture something under a government

186
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,580
space agency's Commission and it's a

187
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,410
completely different thing to develop an

188
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,030
entire independent launch program

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,300
difference between a company that builds

192
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,490
a road or a hospital for a government

193
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,140
and another company that builds its own

194
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,090
road or its own private hospital in the

195
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,470
first case the government makes all the

196
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,120
decisions while in the second it's the

197
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,070
company itself that takes the initiative

198
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,080
makes the decisions and decides what to

199
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
spend on how the budget will be

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,710
allocated how much and when to spend it

201
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,000
well that's exactly what's happening

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,920
with the space race so are we moving

203
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,420
towards a kind of space privatization

204

[Music]

205
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,930
a well divided pie

206
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,300
for the US it's no longer useful to

207
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,070
monopolize each and every one of the

208
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,290
fields of the aerospace sector not only

209
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,880
does it not make sense it's also

210
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,310
counterproductive

[Music]

212
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,500
under the new paradigm government

213
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,570
agencies will focus their resources on

214
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,940
basic scientific research such as the

215
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,500
investigation of the lunar surface

216
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,750

00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:29,419
with Applied Research or in other words

220
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,189

00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:33,349
launching services with reusable rockets

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:35,300

between public agencies and companies

228
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,399
could bring us the best years of space

229
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,589
exploration yet for now a key question

230
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:54,120
why have private companies managed to

231
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,980
perform so much better than typical

232
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,079
government space agencies in terms of

233
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,760
cost efficiency and innovation

234
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,889
well surely many of you already know the

235
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,389
answer to this and that's market

236
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,519
incentives in other words making things

237
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,010
work at a reasonable price to make money

238
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,899
money that by the way it usually comes

239
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,269
surprised Breyers from the government

240
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:19,380

241
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,930
2018 various public agencies in the

242
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,639
United States such as NASA and the Air

243
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,130
Force have invested 7.2 billion dollars

244
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,769
in 67 aerospace companies of all this

245
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,709
money 93% went to companies dedicated to

246
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,750
rocket launches companies like SpaceX

247
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,130
therefore every dollar invested by

248
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,800
public agencies achieves greater results

249
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,540
so even though the NASA budget for

250
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,639
example has decreased their spending

251
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,060
efficiency has increased significantly

252
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,829
your musk says the new SpaceX Falcon

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,320
Heavy Rock it crushes its competition on

254
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,390

255
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,940
money in companies like SpaceX

256
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,959
practically since they were founded

257
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,000
during the first decade of operations

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,860
SpaceX spent 1 billion dollars

259
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,510
approximately half of that money came

260
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,730
from government contracts with NASA in

261
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,740
other words NASA financed a large part

262
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,110
of SpaceX's growth

263
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,210
the truth is that this strategy has

264
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,950
worked for both sides development of

265
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,140
SpaceX has led to unprecedented and

266
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,270
substantial cost savings for NASA just

267
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,550
since 1981 the cost per kilo sent into

268
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,990
Earth's lower orbit has plummeted from

269
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,300
more than $85,000 with the Space Shuttle

270
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,150
to less than $2,000 with SpaceX's Falcon

271
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:34,770

[Music]

273
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,750
and that's just the beginning because

274
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,640
soon other rockets such as the Falcon

275
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,350
Heavy promised to plunge the cost per

276
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,540
kilogram launched into space who figures

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,320
wondering now well hang on Simon what

281
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,670
about Europe you're only talking about

282
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,710
the United States sir what's Europe

283
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,930
doing well Europe has Arian space the

284
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,030
European aerospace company that handles

285
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,520
most of ESA S launches the European

286
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,410

287
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,070

and Europe from Pioneer to lost in space

291
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,190
if I told you that not too long ago

292
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,140
Arian space Europe was the world leader

293
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,940
in commercial rocket launchers

294
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,610
what would he say and I use the past

295
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,080
tense here because as you can see from

296
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,780
this graph as of 2013 and because of the

297
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,940
success of SpaceX Europe has lost its

298
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,650
dominant position but the number of

299
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,420
commercial space launchers in favour of

300
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,930
the United States

[Music]

302
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,220
now what makes a company like ariane

303
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,800
space which takes almost 20% of ESA is

304
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
more than six billion dollar and your

305
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,340
budget unable to compete against newly

306
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,680
created companies such as SpaceX and why

307
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,270
did the United States leave Europe

308
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,100
behind in this industry

309
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,260
[Music]

310
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,600
as you can see RM space was created in

311
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,850
1980 to compete with the US is outdated

312
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,340
and expensive space shuttle in the 1990s

313
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,960
it's Aryan v rocket managed to reduce

314
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,690
launch costs 275 million dollars in

315
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,670
comparison with the more than 450

316
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,870
million dollars that these space

317
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,550
shuttles launch costs

318
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,440
but in addition to its impressive cost

319
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
at the time the Ariane 5 also became the

320
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,730
world's most reliable rocket it only had

321
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,040
two absolute failures in more than 100

322
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,330
launchers so everything seemed to

323
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,310
indicate that Europe was set to be in a

324
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,290
leading position but following decades

325
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,600
and in fact it was for several years

326
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,620
until 2013

327
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,950
[Music]

328
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,110
but I'd quickly turned when suddenly

329
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,690
that 175 million dollar price tag which

330
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,250
was the cost of launching the Ariane 5

331
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,649
became way too much in comparison with

332
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,230
the scant 60 million dollars of SpaceX's

333
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,389
Falcon 9 and that's precisely where the

334
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,579
European aerospace industry's problem

335
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,320

million dollars and which could be

351
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,070
purchased into operation as early as
