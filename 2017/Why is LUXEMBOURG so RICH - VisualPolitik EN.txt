1
00:00:06.95 --> 00:00:11.519
Luxembourg is the only country in the

2
00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.200
world whose Prime Minister is openly gay

3
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.750
we are talking about one of the most

4
00:00:13.2 --> 00:00:17.520
tolerant open-minded societies on the

5
00:00:15.75 --> 00:00:20.070
planet in fact they have a population of

6
00:00:17.52 --> 00:00:21.330
around 500,000 inhabitants and 40% of

7
00:00:20.07 --> 00:00:23.609
them are immigrants in other words

8
00:00:21.33 --> 00:00:25.859
Luxembourg is the smallest country in

9
00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.269
the European Union Marta the one with

10
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.269
the biggest share of immigrants

11
00:00:30.74 --> 00:00:36.510
nonetheless what made Luxembourg famous

12
00:00:33.63 --> 00:00:39.329
can be summarized in just one word and

13
00:00:36.51 --> 00:00:41.309
that word is money yes dear viewer the

14
00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.920
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is one of the

15
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.559
three wealthiest countries on earth here

16
00:00:43.92 --> 00:00:48.360
the minimum wage is around 2,000 euros a

17
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
month no that's not average wage that's

18
00:00:48.36 --> 00:00:54.000
the minimum wage the normal wage in

19
00:00:50.76 --> 00:00:56.010
Luxembourg five thousand euros a month

20
00:00:54.0 --> 00:00:59.039
for comparison Luxembourgish people have

21
00:00:56.01 --> 00:01:02.690
a GDP per capita twice as big as that of

22
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.690
Australians or the Danes

23
00:01:05.38 --> 00:01:10.580
alright alright but just hold on for a

24
00:01:08.45 --> 00:01:12.680
second because there is a little trick

25
00:01:10.58 --> 00:01:14.540
in this figure you see almost half of

26
00:01:12.68 --> 00:01:17.410
the workers in this country actually

27
00:01:14.54 --> 00:01:19.610
live outside of it every day around

28
00:01:17.41 --> 00:01:21.440
160,000 people commute to this country

29
00:01:19.61 --> 00:01:23.510
and then go back to their homes in

30
00:01:21.44 --> 00:01:25.430
Germany France or Belgium in other words

31
00:01:23.51 --> 00:01:27.560
they create wealth in the country but

32
00:01:25.43 --> 00:01:29.690
they don't live there this is why when

33
00:01:27.56 --> 00:01:31.730
we divide Luxembourg's GDP among their

34
00:01:29.69 --> 00:01:34.330
population we get such an enormous

35
00:01:31.73 --> 00:01:34.330
number

36
00:01:37.89 --> 00:01:42.560
but even with these statistical

37
00:01:40.65 --> 00:01:45.180
deviations no one can deny that

38
00:01:42.56 --> 00:01:47.430
Luxembourg is kind of a country for

39
00:01:45.18 --> 00:01:49.890
millionaires and this explains why its

40
00:01:47.43 --> 00:01:51.720
capital Luxembourg City is among the

41
00:01:49.89 --> 00:01:53.729
cities in the world with the highest

42
00:01:51.72 --> 00:01:55.470
quality of life many of you might think

43
00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.810
that this can all be explained because

44
00:01:55.47 --> 00:01:59.759
Luxembourg is a fiscal Haven but the

45
00:01:57.81 --> 00:02:02.190
truth is that other countries like Malta

46
00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.470
and Cyprus also have low taxes but they

47
00:02:02.19 --> 00:02:07.050
are not even half as rich as Luxembourg

48
00:02:04.47 --> 00:02:09.179
so the big question here is what does

49
00:02:07.05 --> 00:02:11.910
Luxembourg have that makes them so

50
00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.760
incredibly wealthy what did they do in

51
00:02:11.91 --> 00:02:17.570
this country to enjoy such a fantastic

52
00:02:14.76 --> 00:02:17.570
quality of life

53
00:02:20.47 --> 00:02:25.250
today well we are going to answer that

54
00:02:23.15 --> 00:02:31.790
very question but before we do let's

55
00:02:25.25 --> 00:02:35.180
take a look back at the history the keys

56
00:02:31.79 --> 00:02:36.830
of Steel by the year 1815 the Grand

57
00:02:35.18 --> 00:02:39.130
Duchy of Luxembourg became an

58
00:02:36.83 --> 00:02:40.940
independent country and I say

59
00:02:39.13 --> 00:02:42.590
independence because none of its

60
00:02:40.94 --> 00:02:44.600
neighbors really recognized its

61
00:02:42.59 --> 00:02:46.519
independence France and Prussia what

62
00:02:44.6 --> 00:02:48.290
Germany used to be back then fought for

63
00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.800
control of the Duchy on several

64
00:02:48.29 --> 00:02:50.800
occasions

65
00:02:54.26 --> 00:02:58.010
in fact despite their government's

66
00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.019
desire for independence the territory of

67
00:02:58.01 --> 00:03:01.909
Luxembourg was owned by King William the

68
00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.980
third of the Netherlands during these

69
00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.690
years Luxembourg was far from being a

70
00:03:03.98 --> 00:03:07.790
wealthy country most of its citizens

71
00:03:05.69 --> 00:03:09.560
survived thanks to agriculture and iron

72
00:03:07.79 --> 00:03:11.510
mining back then one in every five

73
00:03:09.56 --> 00:03:13.370
people from Luxembourg was emigrating to

74
00:03:11.51 --> 00:03:15.140
America nonetheless living between two

75
00:03:13.37 --> 00:03:17.720
rival countries like France and Prussia

76
00:03:15.14 --> 00:03:19.580
had its advantages too you see during

77
00:03:17.72 --> 00:03:21.319
this time Germany didn't exist as a

78
00:03:19.58 --> 00:03:24.019
country instead there were a lot of

79
00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.250
Republic's kingdoms and duchies united

80
00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.250
under a Confederation

81
00:03:29.7 --> 00:03:33.840
if you want to know what a confederation

82
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.670
is well click on this video the truth is

83
00:03:33.84 --> 00:03:37.770
all the German states traded among

84
00:03:35.67 --> 00:03:39.720
themselves that basically created a

85
00:03:37.77 --> 00:03:40.680
special free trade zone which they

86
00:03:39.72 --> 00:03:43.530
called the sovereign

87
00:03:40.68 --> 00:03:46.020
alright so in 1942 Luxembourg became a

88
00:03:43.53 --> 00:03:47.819
member of this sovereign and since that

89
00:03:46.02 --> 00:03:49.680
point history well it would never be the

90
00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.330
same again as I said before poor

91
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:53.880
Luxembourg was based on two main

92
00:03:51.33 --> 00:03:55.410
industries agriculture and iron mining

93
00:03:53.88 --> 00:03:57.600
and remember here these are the times of

94
00:03:55.41 --> 00:04:00.300
the Industrial Revolution steel was

95
00:03:57.6 --> 00:04:02.610
needed for well basically everything it

96
00:04:00.3 --> 00:04:04.769
was used in everything from machines to

97
00:04:02.61 --> 00:04:06.750
buildings and Luxembourgish citizens

98
00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.140
well they were sitting on top of a pile

99
00:04:06.75 --> 00:04:15.060
of iron but not only that we're talking

100
00:04:13.14 --> 00:04:17.340
about a tiny country placed in the

101
00:04:15.06 --> 00:04:19.229
intersection between France Germany and

102
00:04:17.34 --> 00:04:21.389
Belgium in other words it was the

103
00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.280
perfect points have a railroad so they

104
00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.800
could send the iron to all three

105
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:27.900
countries all the sudden Luxembourg

106
00:04:25.8 --> 00:04:30.000
became ground zero for all of these

107
00:04:27.9 --> 00:04:32.340
trade routes as well as one of the

108
00:04:30.0 --> 00:04:35.370
biggest steel providers on the planet in

109
00:04:32.34 --> 00:04:37.590
fact many of those New York skyscrapers

110
00:04:35.37 --> 00:04:39.860
were built with beams made in this

111
00:04:37.59 --> 00:04:39.860
country

112
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:46.850
this is why the biggest steel companies

113
00:04:44.84 --> 00:04:47.300
are Luxembourgish the biggest of them

114
00:04:46.85 --> 00:04:49.670
all

115
00:04:47.3 --> 00:04:51.800
ArcelorMittal is one that you might have

116
00:04:49.67 --> 00:04:53.780
even heard about in financial newspapers

117
00:04:51.8 --> 00:04:56.360
in other words in just a few decades

118
00:04:53.78 --> 00:04:58.550
luxembourg got to the same level as its

119
00:04:56.36 --> 00:05:00.980
neighbors but still it was not the

120
00:04:58.55 --> 00:05:03.380
economic BM off that it is today they

121
00:05:00.98 --> 00:05:09.890
still needed a special sauce and while

122
00:05:03.38 --> 00:05:11.990
that special sauce was this 1929 this is

123
00:05:09.89 --> 00:05:14.480
the year when luxembourg passed the

124
00:05:11.99 --> 00:05:16.580
holding law passed wait just a minute

125
00:05:14.48 --> 00:05:18.590
here because you might now be wondering

126
00:05:16.58 --> 00:05:20.960
well what's corporate holding all about

127
00:05:18.59 --> 00:05:22.700
well let's take coca-cola as an example

128
00:05:20.96 --> 00:05:24.440
on the one hand coca-cola is a beverage

129
00:05:22.7 --> 00:05:26.090
brand but on the other hand there is the

130
00:05:24.44 --> 00:05:27.320
coca-cola company this is a big

131
00:05:26.09 --> 00:05:29.480
conglomerate that contains other

132
00:05:27.32 --> 00:05:32.920
companies like Fanta Schweppes or Coca

133
00:05:29.48 --> 00:05:32.920
Cola the beverage brand itself

134
00:05:34.73 --> 00:05:39.480
okay so this big conglomerate is called

135
00:05:37.62 --> 00:05:41.190
a Holding Corporation and the companies

136
00:05:39.48 --> 00:05:43.500
inside it are called subsidiary

137
00:05:41.19 --> 00:05:45.180
companies these subsidiaries can be in

138
00:05:43.5 --> 00:05:46.740
different countries and other guys who

139
00:05:45.18 --> 00:05:48.450
produce and distribute the drinks

140
00:05:46.74 --> 00:05:50.640
however the role of the holding company

141
00:05:48.45 --> 00:05:52.560
is mainly to manage the property of

142
00:05:50.64 --> 00:05:55.050
these other subsidiary companies all

143
00:05:52.56 --> 00:05:57.480
right so this 1929 law it offered

144
00:05:55.05 --> 00:05:59.760
amazingly good tax conditions to those

145
00:05:57.48 --> 00:06:03.380
holding companies basically they paid

146
00:05:59.76 --> 00:06:03.380
around 1% tax

147
00:06:05.61 --> 00:06:09.659
take these were the 1930s and back then

148
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.849
there weren't as many holding companies

149
00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.949
as there are today just remember that

150
00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.409
those were the years when coca-cola was

151
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.330
starting to expand to other markets so

152
00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.620
Luxembourg was doing great but they

153
00:06:18.33 --> 00:06:21.419
still weren't the giant that they are

154
00:06:19.62 --> 00:06:24.000
today in other words Luxembourg was

155
00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.330
growing but not that much more than

156
00:06:24.0 --> 00:06:26.330
other countries

157
00:06:32.11 --> 00:06:35.680
nonetheless these 70s were the times

158
00:06:34.06 --> 00:06:37.720
when American companies conquered the

159
00:06:35.68 --> 00:06:39.340
European and Asian markets that finally

160
00:06:37.72 --> 00:06:42.009
had some money to spend on consumer

161
00:06:39.34 --> 00:06:43.990
goods during these years many of the big

162
00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.939
corporations we know today were born in

163
00:06:43.99 --> 00:06:47.710
other words a lot of holding sprang up

164
00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:49.419
and their profits came from all around

165
00:06:47.71 --> 00:06:51.430
the planet so where did they decide to

166
00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:52.689
set up their headquarters well since

167
00:06:51.43 --> 00:06:54.639
they could choose anywhere they wanted

168
00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.099
to they went to the places with the best

169
00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.659
fiscal conditions and Luxembourg had

170
00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.449
everything they wanted and a whole lot

171
00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:03.580
more you see by the 1960s in the 1970s

172
00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.349
the country already had a big banking

173
00:07:03.58 --> 00:07:07.060
industry the best lawyers accountants

174
00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:09.129
and economists were living there ready

175
00:07:07.06 --> 00:07:10.930
to help those big companies in order to

176
00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.030
take advantage of those business

177
00:07:10.93 --> 00:07:15.190
friendly laws and this is how this

178
00:07:13.03 --> 00:07:17.610
little country got into their silver

179
00:07:15.19 --> 00:07:17.610
decades

180
00:07:22.1 --> 00:07:26.090
yes do you believe what you see the

181
00:07:24.14 --> 00:07:29.240
economy of Luxembourg became 2 times

182
00:07:26.09 --> 00:07:31.340
bigger in less than 6 years compared to

183
00:07:29.24 --> 00:07:32.300
this China or Singapore's growth rate

184
00:07:31.34 --> 00:07:33.590
it's kind of a joke

185
00:07:32.3 --> 00:07:36.020
and yes you had that right I did say

186
00:07:33.59 --> 00:07:38.300
before silver decade because all of this

187
00:07:36.02 --> 00:07:39.020
growth was nothing compared to what was

188
00:07:38.3 --> 00:07:41.090
to come

189
00:07:39.02 --> 00:07:43.910
think about it we are already talking

190
00:07:41.09 --> 00:07:46.520
about the 2000s the age of the online

191
00:07:43.91 --> 00:07:48.950
business boom these brand new corporate

192
00:07:46.52 --> 00:07:51.800
juggernauts operated all over the world

193
00:07:48.95 --> 00:07:53.870
had dozens of subsidiary companies in

194
00:07:51.8 --> 00:07:56.090
every country and not concentrated in

195
00:07:53.87 --> 00:07:58.960
any specific location because they sold

196
00:07:56.09 --> 00:07:58.960
everywhere

197
00:08:00.83 --> 00:08:05.449
in other words these tech companies were

198
00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.440
made to love Luxembourg so if you

199
00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:08.120
thought this country was already

200
00:08:06.44 --> 00:08:12.340
astoundingly rich and could have grown

201
00:08:08.12 --> 00:08:12.340
more well do think twice

202
00:08:20.31 --> 00:08:23.580
it's amazing isn't it I don't know if

203
00:08:22.32 --> 00:08:26.040
you noticed this but in just five years

204
00:08:23.58 --> 00:08:27.780
Luxembourg's GDP per capita went from

205
00:08:26.04 --> 00:08:31.169
fifty thousand US dollars which is

206
00:08:27.78 --> 00:08:32.940
already a lot to over 100 thousand

207
00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:34.590
dollars when you live in the country

208
00:08:32.94 --> 00:08:36.930
with a GDP per capita of over a hundred

209
00:08:34.59 --> 00:08:38.820
thousand dollars well you can fill your

210
00:08:36.93 --> 00:08:41.130
swimming pool with champagne

211
00:08:38.82 --> 00:08:44.810
in fact the Audi a3 is the third

212
00:08:41.13 --> 00:08:44.810
best-selling car in Luxembourg

213
00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.189
and yes well I probably do know what

214
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:54.959
you're thinking right now you think that

215
00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:56.850
this country has made its fortune by

216
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:59.550
helping companies avoid paying their

217
00:08:56.85 --> 00:09:00.870
taxes right well the answer it's a

218
00:08:59.55 --> 00:09:02.279
little bit more complicated than that

219
00:09:00.87 --> 00:09:04.170
you see the fact that a holding

220
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.759
Corporation is located in Luxembourg

221
00:09:04.17 --> 00:09:08.009
does not mean that its subsidiary

222
00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:09.779
companies don't pay taxes elsewhere for

223
00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:11.399
instance Amazon has its headquarters in

224
00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:12.990
Luxembourg nonetheless it's British

225
00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:14.939
subsidiary that is the company that

226
00:09:12.99 --> 00:09:17.189
sells products and managers logistics in

227
00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:20.370
this country still has to pay taxes in

228
00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:25.350
the UK or at least that is the theory in

229
00:09:20.37 --> 00:09:27.870
fact the reality is way different luxe

230
00:09:25.35 --> 00:09:29.399
leaks so let's get back to our Amazon

231
00:09:27.87 --> 00:09:31.379
example as we said the profits of his

232
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:32.100
British subsidiary are taxed in the UK

233
00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:33.839
right

234
00:09:32.1 --> 00:09:35.670
well the question that then comes up is

235
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.829
what if they don't have any profits

236
00:09:35.67 --> 00:09:40.139
whatsoever imagine that right after they

237
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:42.120
pay taxes Amazon UK gets a big loan a

238
00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:44.100
big loan with a really high interest

239
00:09:42.12 --> 00:09:46.290
rate so high in fact that the company it

240
00:09:44.1 --> 00:09:48.180
takes losses and who lends them that

241
00:09:46.29 --> 00:09:50.100
money exactly well of course that would

242
00:09:48.18 --> 00:09:51.689
be Amazon holdings in Luxembourg this

243
00:09:50.1 --> 00:09:54.089
weight these subsidiary companies have

244
00:09:51.689 --> 00:09:55.980
almost no profits one way or another

245
00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:58.170
they manage to send their money to the

246
00:09:55.98 --> 00:10:00.899
Luxembourg branch and as we said before

247
00:09:58.17 --> 00:10:06.629
in Luxembourg taxes are really low for

248
00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:09.269
companies of course all of this is

249
00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:11.009
perfectly legal but in 2009 during the

250
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.689
financial crisis the American government

251
00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:14.009
realized the huge amount of money they

252
00:10:12.689 --> 00:10:15.959
were losing with all of these big

253
00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:17.879
companies moving overseas that's why

254
00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:20.670
today I'm announcing a set of proposals

255
00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:23.790
to crackdown on illegal overseas tax

256
00:10:20.67 --> 00:10:25.529
evasion closed loopholes and make it

257
00:10:23.79 --> 00:10:28.079
more profitable for companies to create

258
00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:29.610
jobs here in the United States since

259
00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:31.410
then other governments have also

260
00:10:29.61 --> 00:10:33.180
followed in obamas steps

261
00:10:31.41 --> 00:10:34.860
now don't forget Luxembourg is one of

262
00:10:33.18 --> 00:10:36.360
the European Union's founding members

263
00:10:34.86 --> 00:10:38.670
this means the other club members were

264
00:10:36.36 --> 00:10:40.019
angry and willing to lay on a lot of

265
00:10:38.67 --> 00:10:41.990
political pressure but the biggest

266
00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:45.509
crisis for this country came in the year

267
00:10:41.99 --> 00:10:47.670
2014 this was the time when a group of

268
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:51.139
accountants released a ton of private

269
00:10:47.67 --> 00:10:51.139
data from these big corporations

270
00:10:54.46 --> 00:10:59.980
thanks to the so called Lux leaks we

271
00:10:57.7 --> 00:11:01.990
could all see the tax evasion strategies

272
00:10:59.98 --> 00:11:03.700
employed by thousands of different

273
00:11:01.99 --> 00:11:05.110
companies now do you know what I told

274
00:11:03.7 --> 00:11:07.060
you about loans between different

275
00:11:05.11 --> 00:11:09.070
subsidiary companies within a holding

276
00:11:07.06 --> 00:11:10.930
well here is another way of improving

277
00:11:09.07 --> 00:11:13.480
the deal you see all these big companies

278
00:11:10.93 --> 00:11:14.740
have big consulting firms so they can

279
00:11:13.48 --> 00:11:16.080
help them with their accounting

280
00:11:14.74 --> 00:11:18.040
consulting firms like

281
00:11:16.08 --> 00:11:20.470
PricewaterhouseCoopers with a big

282
00:11:18.04 --> 00:11:22.270
customer portfolio in Luxembourg there

283
00:11:20.47 --> 00:11:24.070
enough power to sit down with the Prime

284
00:11:22.27 --> 00:11:28.540
Minister back then jean-claude Juncker

285
00:11:24.07 --> 00:11:30.910
and arrange a special tax deal on

286
00:11:28.54 --> 00:11:32.910
current spotlight after Luxembourg Tax

287
00:11:30.91 --> 00:11:36.010
revelations the leaked documents

288
00:11:32.91 --> 00:11:38.500
demonstrate tax arrangements negotiated

289
00:11:36.01 --> 00:11:40.150
by PricewaterhouseCoopers as you can

290
00:11:38.5 --> 00:11:41.320
imagine the release of the lux leaks was

291
00:11:40.15 --> 00:11:44.380
a total GameChanger

292
00:11:41.32 --> 00:11:47.260
in fact this year 2017 Luxembourg passed

293
00:11:44.38 --> 00:11:49.240
a brand-new fiscal reform and probably

294
00:11:47.26 --> 00:11:51.370
many of these arrangements aren't going

295
00:11:49.24 --> 00:11:52.600
to have to change but hold on just a

296
00:11:51.37 --> 00:11:54.460
minute here because this doesn't mean

297
00:11:52.6 --> 00:11:56.320
that Luxembourg is going to stop being a

298
00:11:54.46 --> 00:11:58.890
rich place in fact the opposite is

299
00:11:56.32 --> 00:11:58.890
probably true

300
00:12:00.48 --> 00:12:05.100
despite this political turbulence the

301
00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:07.410
country grew at a rate of 4.2% last year

302
00:12:05.1 --> 00:12:09.600
this is way faster than almost any other

303
00:12:07.41 --> 00:12:11.639
country in Europe having so many savings

304
00:12:09.6 --> 00:12:14.040
Luxembourg has invested in many other

305
00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:15.990
industries now of course they have steel

306
00:12:14.04 --> 00:12:23.820
they have their banks and they also have

307
00:12:15.99 --> 00:12:26.760
space Luxembourg's bet on space industry

308
00:12:23.82 --> 00:12:28.350
shows early signs of success yep you

309
00:12:26.76 --> 00:12:29.430
heard that right in fact Luxembourg in

310
00:12:28.35 --> 00:12:31.709
the United States are the first

311
00:12:29.43 --> 00:12:33.720
countries to pass laws regulating space

312
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:35.339
mining and this tiny country is expected

313
00:12:33.72 --> 00:12:37.740
to become the Silicon Valley of the

314
00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:40.230
aerospace industry this explains partly

315
00:12:37.74 --> 00:12:41.760
some of the details of the 2017 fiscal

316
00:12:40.23 --> 00:12:43.050
reform of course the governments of

317
00:12:41.76 --> 00:12:45.329
Luxembourg doesn't want to help big

318
00:12:43.05 --> 00:12:47.100
corporations avoid taxes at least this

319
00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:48.930
is what they say officially instead they

320
00:12:47.1 --> 00:12:50.639
have reduced taxes for smaller companies

321
00:12:48.93 --> 00:12:52.680
and are actively trying to improve

322
00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:55.380
conditions in order to encourage more

323
00:12:52.68 --> 00:12:57.949
tech startups but this is a subject for

324
00:12:55.38 --> 00:12:57.949
another video

325
00:13:00.48 --> 00:13:03.939
now the question for you is do you think

326
00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:05.949
we're gonna see another moment of

327
00:13:03.939 --> 00:13:06.490
skyrocketing growth in Luxembourg's

328
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:08.619
economy

329
00:13:06.49 --> 00:13:10.569
well this country truly become a world

330
00:13:08.619 --> 00:13:12.220
leader in the aerospace industry well
