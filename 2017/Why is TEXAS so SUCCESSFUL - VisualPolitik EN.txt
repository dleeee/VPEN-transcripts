00:00:01.53 --> 00:00:06.720
think of country music Western George

with over 270,000 square miles

13
00:00:36.86 --> 00:00:42.290
Texas is three times the size of the

that Texas is one of the largest states

strike son as a hostile wasteland but

25
00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.080
there is far more to it than that there

employment in Texas has tripled the

national average in the same period

Texas has created a million more jobs in

California a state which has 12 million

69

financial crisis in December 2007 Texas

which represents about 8 percent of the

72
00:03:12.63 --> 00:03:18.360
US population has been responsible for

73
00:03:15.3 --> 00:03:20.820
one out of every four jobs created in

74
00:03:18.36 --> 00:03:22.800
the country so it's no surprise here

75
00:03:20.82 --> 00:03:24.630
that unemployment is lower than the US

76
00:03:22.8 --> 00:03:26.970

at the settle for 35 percent also as I

81
00:03:33.84 --> 00:03:38.520
was saying earlier it is the stage that

82
00:03:35.4 --> 00:03:42.210

85
00:03:45.77 --> 00:03:49.800
having said all of this is no surprise

86
00:03:47.88 --> 00:03:56.210
that people consider Texas to be the

87
00:03:49.8 --> 00:03:58.830
true economic driver of the u.s. Haiti

88
00:03:56.21 --> 00:04:00.750
now it is true that taxes have suffered

89
00:03:58.83 --> 00:04:02.460
because of the fall in oil prices but

90
00:04:00.75 --> 00:04:04.980
many people believe that due to its

91
00:04:02.46 --> 00:04:07.440
increasingly diversified economy it will

92
00:04:04.98 --> 00:04:09.900
still lead the way in the United States

93
00:04:07.44 --> 00:04:15.780
so you might be asking now what exactly

94
00:04:09.9 --> 00:04:19.620
is so special about Texas town planning

95
00:04:15.78 --> 00:04:21.870
regulations for middle and low income

access to big and affordable home

99
00:04:26.67 --> 00:04:30.570
this happens because regulation in the

100
00:04:28.92 --> 00:04:32.520
state is very flexible and it means that

101
00:04:30.57 --> 00:04:34.230
homes can be built for not much more

102
00:04:32.52 --> 00:04:37.500
than the cost of the labor and their

authorized the building of 200,000 homes

106
00:04:42.93 --> 00:04:48.000
this is compared to just 16,000 in Santa

108

in Texas this is compared to one being

112

built every 50 in California this means

113
00:05:04.32 --> 00:05:08.010
that even if you make less money in

00:05:06.09 --> 00:05:10.620

00:07:18.83 --> 00:07:23.509
Texas's economic boom has attracted a

172
00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.520
great deal of cultural and ethnic

173
00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.139
diversity contributing to cities like

174
00:07:25.52 --> 00:07:29.060
Austin becoming a great place for

175
00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.860
musicians and other types of artists

176
00:07:29.06 --> 00:07:32.900
Texas can teach us that it is possible

177
00:07:30.86 --> 00:07:35.090
to fight the negative effects of

178
00:07:32.9 --> 00:07:37.430
globalization as well as the automation

179
00:07:35.09 --> 00:07:39.169
of jobs by machines and they haven't

180
00:07:37.43 --> 00:07:41.210
done this by protecting their companies

181
00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.699
from foreign competition they've done it

182
00:07:41.21 --> 00:07:46.759
by reducing the obstacles that companies

183
00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:49.460
and individuals face in the state every

184
00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:51.440
week businesses leave California to

185
00:07:49.46 --> 00:07:54.800
escape high tax and strangling

186
00:07:51.44 --> 00:07:57.500
regulations they come to Texas because

187
00:07:54.8 --> 00:07:59.509
we keep taxes low and so this is just

188
00:07:57.5 --> 00:08:00.830
our opinion of taxes here at visual

189
00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:03.409
politic and we would love to know what

190
00:08:00.83 --> 00:08:05.150
you think do use the comments below to

191
00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:06.680
let us know your opinion do you think

192
00:08:05.15 --> 00:08:08.990
that more states will start following

193
00:08:06.68 --> 00:08:10.009
the example of Texas and what do you

194
00:08:08.99 --> 00:08:12.320
think do you think the Trump presidency

195
00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:14.780
could turn this historically Republican

196
00:08:12.32 --> 00:08:16.520
state into a democratic one by 2020 and

197
00:08:14.78 --> 00:08:19.070
do you think Texas is ever a place you

198
00:08:16.52 --> 00:08:20.330
could see yourself living as I say let

199
00:08:19.07 --> 00:08:21.979
