8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
is not the only matter we should be

9
00:00:34.41 --> 00:00:37.950
congratulating Canada on the country

10
00:00:36.42 --> 00:00:40.620
reached its one hundred and fiftieth

11
00:00:37.95 --> 00:00:42.360
anniversary in great shape because well

12
00:00:40.62 --> 00:00:44.460
if there's something we can say about

13
00:00:42.36 --> 00:00:51.449
Canada right now it's that the country

14
00:00:44.46 --> 00:00:53.039
is certainly in vogue and he has Canada

15
00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.920
is also the homeland of many celebrities

16
00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.520
that we all know well

17
00:00:54.92 --> 00:01:04.379
[Music]

18
00:01:02.52 --> 00:01:06.030
laughter there has been one celebrity

19
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.680
who has been put in the international

20
00:01:06.03 --> 00:01:14.640
political spotlight we are of course

21
00:01:07.68 --> 00:01:16.470
talking about Justin no no no no no not

22
00:01:14.64 --> 00:01:22.440
that Justin we meant this one of course

23
00:01:16.47 --> 00:01:24.780
Justin Trudeau Canada has reached its

24
00:01:22.44 --> 00:01:26.340
150th birthday as one of the richest

25
00:01:24.78 --> 00:01:28.050
countries in the world with a top-notch

26
00:01:26.34 --> 00:01:30.300
quality of life as well as being one of

27
00:01:28.05 --> 00:01:33.030
the most admired countries on earth

28
00:01:30.3 --> 00:01:35.310
certainly not bad right so now you might

29
00:01:33.03 --> 00:01:36.720
be wondering what is the cause of all of

30
00:01:35.31 --> 00:01:39.030
this what are the main achievements that

31
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:41.729
Canada is celebrating after 150 years

32
00:01:39.03 --> 00:01:43.890
and importantly well is there a dark

33
00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.600
side to Canada we're going to answer all

34
00:01:43.89 --> 00:01:50.910
of those questions in this video but

35
00:01:45.6 --> 00:01:54.030
first let us get some perspective the

36
00:01:50.91 --> 00:01:55.800
great transformation you might not have

37
00:01:54.03 --> 00:01:57.869
heard much about Canada recently but we

38
00:01:55.8 --> 00:02:00.300
can certainly say that they are no

39
00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.369
ordinary country in fact Canada is the

40
00:02:00.3 --> 00:02:04.229
second biggest country in the world with

41
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.119
its territory covering six different

42
00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.649
time zones and guess which country has

43
00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.590
the most coastline in the world

44
00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.360
well no prizes if you guessed Canada of

45
00:02:10.59 --> 00:02:14.340
course there's all regular visual polity

46
00:02:12.36 --> 00:02:16.140
viewers already know neither the size of

47
00:02:14.34 --> 00:02:18.209
a country surface nor its coastline

48
00:02:16.14 --> 00:02:23.220
determines its wealth or how many

49
00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:26.130
opportunities its citizens have so then

50
00:02:23.22 --> 00:02:27.900
what's really behind these success on

51
00:02:26.13 --> 00:02:30.000
Canada well one key factor here is the

52
00:02:27.9 --> 00:02:34.290
disastrous years the Canada had in the

53
00:02:30.0 --> 00:02:36.870
late 80s and early 90s during this time

54
00:02:34.29 --> 00:02:39.150
Canada suffered economic stagnation and

55
00:02:36.87 --> 00:02:42.120
several crises these were bad enough

56
00:02:39.15 --> 00:02:44.970
that in 1995 The Wall Street Journal

57
00:02:42.12 --> 00:02:47.490
called Canada an honorary member of the

58
00:02:44.97 --> 00:02:50.550
third world due to its inability to

59
00:02:47.49 --> 00:02:52.860
control government accounts through them

60
00:02:50.55 --> 00:02:55.349
as you can see things have changed

61
00:02:52.86 --> 00:02:57.209
enormously Canada really knew how to

62
00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.190
play to their strengths and get rid of

63
00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.450
their weaknesses and especially and

64
00:02:59.19 --> 00:03:02.580
above all Canadians have really

65
00:03:00.45 --> 00:03:05.599
understood the importance and meaning of

66
00:03:02.58 --> 00:03:07.550
these two words competitiveness and

67
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.560
integration

68
00:03:07.55 --> 00:03:12.660
after those disastrous years of the 80s

69
00:03:10.56 --> 00:03:15.240
and 90s Canadians realized that before

70
00:03:12.66 --> 00:03:17.970
thinking about spending it is absolutely

71
00:03:15.24 --> 00:03:19.620
essential to think about creating and

72
00:03:17.97 --> 00:03:22.230
they realized that in order to do that

73
00:03:19.62 --> 00:03:24.980
they needed investment businesses and

74
00:03:22.23 --> 00:03:28.870
trade a great deal of trade

75
00:03:24.98 --> 00:03:31.349
[Music]

76
00:03:28.87 --> 00:03:34.109
[Applause]

77
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.359
well so as it was said so it was done

78
00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.310
Canada is today the seventh freest

79
00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.439
economy in the world but if we're

80
00:03:38.31 --> 00:03:42.450
talking about freedom then we can't just

81
00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.730
talk about the economic side of things

82
00:03:42.45 --> 00:03:46.859
the Fraser Institute publishes every

83
00:03:44.73 --> 00:03:48.930
year something called the human freedom

84
00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.510
Index this measures both the economic

85
00:03:48.93 --> 00:03:53.400
and the civil freedoms that people enjoy

86
00:03:51.51 --> 00:03:55.650
quite simply it measures what we can't

87
00:03:53.4 --> 00:03:57.659
do and what we can't though well

88
00:03:55.65 --> 00:04:00.120
according to their research Canada is

89
00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.709
the sixth freest country on earth give

90
00:04:00.12 --> 00:04:03.389
you a better idea of how this compares

91
00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.060
to some other countries well the USA

92
00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:10.919
they ranked 23rd Italy is in at 28 and

93
00:04:06.06 --> 00:04:12.590
Japan is flagging in position 32 maybe

94
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.430
the reason for this is the strong

95
00:04:12.59 --> 00:04:16.620
decentralization that the country has

96
00:04:14.43 --> 00:04:19.019
Canada it's divided into ten provinces

97
00:04:16.62 --> 00:04:21.630
and 3 territories that have so many

98
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.919
unique regulations that in 2017 they

99
00:04:21.63 --> 00:04:26.250
actually had to sign a free trade

100
00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.669
agreement among them new interprovincial

101
00:04:26.25 --> 00:04:31.889
trade deal expected to add billions to

102
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.840
the economy the decentralization is

103
00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.729
absolutely enormous and it is

104
00:04:33.84 --> 00:04:37.740
traditionally resulted in higher costs

105
00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.780
for those companies that don't operate

106
00:04:37.74 --> 00:04:42.060
in a single region but in several

107
00:04:39.78 --> 00:04:45.389
different regions with each region

108
00:04:42.06 --> 00:04:48.199
having different regulations in Ontario

109
00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.470
petrol must be at least 5% ethanol

110
00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.419
Manitoba insists on an 8.5% blend the

111
00:04:52.47 --> 00:04:56.220
positive side of this is that this has

112
00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.960
worked as a counterweight to the federal

113
00:04:56.22 --> 00:05:00.090
governments and it's encouraged them to

114
00:04:57.96 --> 00:05:02.009
make pro citizen policies and that's

115
00:05:00.09 --> 00:05:03.780
something that has driven good public

116
00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.849
policies anyway this new agreement has

117
00:05:03.78 --> 00:05:08.130
been created in order to beat all these

118
00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.780
surprising obstacles further as we

119
00:05:08.13 --> 00:05:11.509
talked about in a previous video there's

120
00:05:09.78 --> 00:05:13.770
also the Canadian bet on

121
00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.780
multiculturalism and well let us be

122
00:05:13.77 --> 00:05:17.430
rather Frankie nowadays this country is

123
00:05:15.78 --> 00:05:22.490
one of the best examples of integration

124
00:05:17.43 --> 00:05:22.490
in the entire world by huge eeka

125
00:05:24.5 --> 00:05:31.710
the Canadian mosaic fossil this Canadian

126
00:05:29.54 --> 00:05:33.479
multiculturalism what's it all really

127
00:05:31.71 --> 00:05:35.910
about well basically it consists of

128
00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.340
accepting that cultural diversity is not

129
00:05:35.91 --> 00:05:40.110
a threat but it's an asset and a source

130
00:05:38.34 --> 00:05:42.090
of opportunities for a country now of

131
00:05:40.11 --> 00:05:44.220
course this multiculturalism is always

132
00:05:42.09 --> 00:05:46.320
subordinate to a core set of values such

133
00:05:44.22 --> 00:05:50.310
as democracy such as the rule of law and

134
00:05:46.32 --> 00:05:52.290
equality for all people now this needs

135
00:05:50.31 --> 00:05:54.120
that in order to be Canadian and be

136
00:05:52.29 --> 00:05:56.280
welcomed into their country you don't

137
00:05:54.12 --> 00:05:58.289
have to replace your culture with any

138
00:05:56.28 --> 00:06:01.080
other like the Canadian culture you just

139
00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:03.120
have to accept and commit to those core

140
00:06:01.08 --> 00:06:04.470
Canadian values and I mean look

141
00:06:03.12 --> 00:06:06.479
Canada has one of the largest

142
00:06:04.47 --> 00:06:08.460
populations of immigrants in the world

143
00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.139
one out of every five Canadians weren't

144
00:06:08.46 --> 00:06:12.090
born in Canada and I mean for some

145
00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.300
cities like Toronto this figure it grows

146
00:06:12.09 --> 00:06:17.160
up to 50% or even higher and it seems

147
00:06:15.3 --> 00:06:19.039
that it will be even higher in the

148
00:06:17.16 --> 00:06:21.270
future because every year more than

149
00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.100
300,000 new immigrants come to this

150
00:06:21.27 --> 00:06:25.530
country which is one of the highest

151
00:06:23.1 --> 00:06:27.090
immigration rates in the entire world

152
00:06:25.53 --> 00:06:28.680
and you know the result of all of this

153
00:06:27.09 --> 00:06:30.900
is do you think is a problem well it's

154
00:06:28.68 --> 00:06:32.310
it's actually no problem at all yeah

155
00:06:30.9 --> 00:06:34.560
look as we said in that previous video

156
00:06:32.31 --> 00:06:36.360
immigration in Canada it's certainly not

157
00:06:34.56 --> 00:06:38.130
for free there's this system that exists

158
00:06:36.36 --> 00:06:40.650
that's based on three fundamental

159
00:06:38.13 --> 00:06:42.600
pillars points family reunification and

160
00:06:40.65 --> 00:06:44.840
refugees

161
00:06:42.6 --> 00:06:47.030
[Music]

162
00:06:44.84 --> 00:06:50.000
the most important one of these is the

163
00:06:47.03 --> 00:06:52.040
point based system this exists do grants

164
00:06:50.0 --> 00:06:53.960
people residents or work permits it

165
00:06:52.04 --> 00:06:55.700
considers things like having a job offer

166
00:06:53.96 --> 00:06:57.980
which is the most important thing or

167
00:06:55.7 --> 00:07:01.730
also maybe having a degree or having the

168
00:06:57.98 --> 00:07:03.590
ability to speak English and you want to

169
00:07:01.73 --> 00:07:05.690
know the results of these policies well

170
00:07:03.59 --> 00:07:07.639
almost 80% of Canadians think that

171
00:07:05.69 --> 00:07:09.410
immigration is good for the economy this

172
00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.450
is something that really shouldn't be so

173
00:07:09.41 --> 00:07:13.370
strange when you consider that all the

174
00:07:11.45 --> 00:07:15.830
statistics show that immigrants the

175
00:07:13.37 --> 00:07:17.479
brand-new Canadians are more educated

176
00:07:15.83 --> 00:07:19.790
they work more hours they create more

177
00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:22.250
businesses and they draw less dollars

178
00:07:19.79 --> 00:07:23.840
from social programs now the question

179
00:07:22.25 --> 00:07:25.580
might be does Canada have them does it

180
00:07:23.84 --> 00:07:27.830
have many rules about immigration and

181
00:07:25.58 --> 00:07:29.840
certainly it does but this sort of

182
00:07:27.83 --> 00:07:32.660
welcoming culture focused on integration

183
00:07:29.84 --> 00:07:35.170
well it's pretty rare to finds

184
00:07:32.66 --> 00:07:38.480
[Music]

185
00:07:35.17 --> 00:07:40.760
in fact since 1977 every Canadian

186
00:07:38.48 --> 00:07:43.340
citizen can hold any other nationality

187
00:07:40.76 --> 00:07:45.200
without restrictions so when someone

188
00:07:43.34 --> 00:07:46.940
emigrates to Canada and after some years

189
00:07:45.2 --> 00:07:48.650
they can obtain their Canadian passport

190
00:07:46.94 --> 00:07:50.900
they don't have to renounce their

191
00:07:48.65 --> 00:07:53.240
previous nationality but if something

192
00:07:50.9 --> 00:07:55.460
might perfectly show Canada's spirits

193
00:07:53.24 --> 00:07:57.830
well that would be Prime Minister Justin

194
00:07:55.46 --> 00:08:00.510
Trudeau hi everyone was Rockland mall

195
00:07:57.83 --> 00:08:07.590
I'm Justin true

196
00:08:00.51 --> 00:08:12.960
[Music]

197
00:08:07.59 --> 00:08:15.360
justin trudeau a political star just

198
00:08:12.96 --> 00:08:18.240
intraday he took office in 2015 almost

199
00:08:15.36 --> 00:08:20.220
by surprise and at just 44 years vain

200
00:08:18.24 --> 00:08:22.500
today he is one of the most popular

201
00:08:20.22 --> 00:08:24.450
politicians in the world and that's true

202
00:08:22.5 --> 00:08:27.870
in Canada as well this is something that

203
00:08:24.45 --> 00:08:30.450
the polls clearly show a recent survey

204
00:08:27.87 --> 00:08:32.789
by abacus data on the leadership of the

205
00:08:30.45 --> 00:08:34.890
prime minister shows that 70 percent of

206
00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:37.260
Canadians are confident that Trudeau

207
00:08:34.89 --> 00:08:39.510
will successfully manage Canada's

208
00:08:37.26 --> 00:08:41.550
relations with its allies sixty-three

209
00:08:39.51 --> 00:08:43.800
percent trust his responsibility to make

210
00:08:41.55 --> 00:08:46.890
decisions and 62 percent believe that

211
00:08:43.8 --> 00:08:48.360
his decisions will be good ones I mean

212
00:08:46.89 --> 00:08:50.430
how many politicians around the world

213
00:08:48.36 --> 00:08:53.610
would really like approval ratings like

214
00:08:50.43 --> 00:08:55.890
those we need a leader

215
00:08:53.61 --> 00:08:58.110
however Trudeau he's not a typical

216
00:08:55.89 --> 00:09:00.390
politician not at all the Prime Minister

217
00:08:58.11 --> 00:09:02.520
of Canada has put on a table a program

218
00:09:00.39 --> 00:09:04.140
and a form of government that's really

219
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:05.970
quite different from what's typically

220
00:09:04.14 --> 00:09:07.860
being used and when you look at his

221
00:09:05.97 --> 00:09:10.560
cabinet I mean it's a realistic sample

222
00:09:07.86 --> 00:09:15.780
of Canada's reality a cabinet that looks

223
00:09:10.56 --> 00:09:16.410
like Canada 15 of the 30 ministers are

224
00:09:15.78 --> 00:09:18.540
women

225
00:09:16.41 --> 00:09:20.100
there's even an Afghanistan veteran and

226
00:09:18.54 --> 00:09:21.630
an individual who is formerly a

227
00:09:20.1 --> 00:09:23.640
volunteer in Niger

228
00:09:21.63 --> 00:09:25.500
there are also business executives and

229
00:09:23.64 --> 00:09:27.960
even some ministers who are Sikhs which

230
00:09:25.5 --> 00:09:33.450
is a religion native to the Punjab state

231
00:09:27.96 --> 00:09:35.520
in India by the way has been Ahmed

232
00:09:33.45 --> 00:09:38.190
Hassan a Somali who arrived to Canada as

233
00:09:35.52 --> 00:09:40.500
a refugee at 16 years old and is now the

234
00:09:38.19 --> 00:09:41.100
Minister of immigration plea amazing

235
00:09:40.5 --> 00:09:42.600
right

236
00:09:41.1 --> 00:09:44.460
Trudeau's political priorities well

237
00:09:42.6 --> 00:09:45.839
there is international has his cabinet

238
00:09:44.46 --> 00:09:47.820
one of the governments of canada's key

239
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:50.040
challenges is to boost trade among

240
00:09:47.82 --> 00:09:53.490
nations now pay attention to that

241
00:09:50.04 --> 00:09:55.410
foreign affairs minister rising trade

242
00:09:53.49 --> 00:09:58.050
barriers hurt the people they are

243
00:09:55.41 --> 00:10:00.540
intended to help they curb growth stifle

244
00:09:58.05 --> 00:10:03.180
innovation and kill employment this is a

245
00:10:00.54 --> 00:10:05.130
lesson we should learn from history this

246
00:10:03.18 --> 00:10:07.050
is why Trudeau wants to sign a free

247
00:10:05.13 --> 00:10:08.790
trade agreements even with China

248
00:10:07.05 --> 00:10:10.440
secondly unlike other governments

249
00:10:08.79 --> 00:10:12.630
Trudeau doesn't just reject

250
00:10:10.44 --> 00:10:14.820
protectionism but he wants to stimulate

251
00:10:12.63 --> 00:10:16.380
a productive change with artificial

252
00:10:14.82 --> 00:10:18.900
intelligence and automation

253
00:10:16.38 --> 00:10:20.130
I mean why hinder technology if there's

254
00:10:18.9 --> 00:10:21.360
something we've seen as history has

255
00:10:20.13 --> 00:10:24.000
progressed is that tech

256
00:10:21.36 --> 00:10:29.970
nology improves people's lives and to

257
00:10:24.0 --> 00:10:31.290
creates more jobs now it might not seem

258
00:10:29.97 --> 00:10:33.060
that something like that is too

259
00:10:31.29 --> 00:10:34.290
complicated to do but the reality is

260
00:10:33.06 --> 00:10:37.019
that there are not many world leaders

261
00:10:34.29 --> 00:10:39.450
who defend this pro-technology position

262
00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:41.670
talking about jobs giving away it's not

263
00:10:39.45 --> 00:10:43.470
exactly a popular line the other great

264
00:10:41.67 --> 00:10:45.149
challenge and maybe the key value of

265
00:10:43.47 --> 00:10:46.860
Trudeau's government's is their best

266
00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:48.930
form boosting civil rights and turning

267
00:10:46.86 --> 00:10:51.300
Canada into an international example of

268
00:10:48.93 --> 00:10:53.490
how this should be done take a look at

269
00:10:51.3 --> 00:10:55.500
the power of this picture Trudeau has

270
00:10:53.49 --> 00:10:58.980
become the first Prime Minister to lead

271
00:10:55.5 --> 00:11:00.810
an LGBTQ Pride Parade there's also the

272
00:10:58.98 --> 00:11:02.970
most recently released program canada's

273
00:11:00.81 --> 00:11:04.410
feminist international assistance policy

274
00:11:02.97 --> 00:11:05.880
yeah you heard that right Trudeau's

275
00:11:04.41 --> 00:11:07.800
government didn't hesitate do you

276
00:11:05.88 --> 00:11:09.630
declare itself feminists and among other

277
00:11:07.8 --> 00:11:11.130
things they have decided to focus most

278
00:11:09.63 --> 00:11:13.350
of their international cooperation

279
00:11:11.13 --> 00:11:16.140
budgets on pushing women's rights where

280
00:11:13.35 --> 00:11:18.060
they are most needed now this it's just

281
00:11:16.14 --> 00:11:19.800
a symbol that sometimes symbols they're

282
00:11:18.06 --> 00:11:21.420
pretty important other symbols and

283
00:11:19.8 --> 00:11:23.670
gestures are is positioned towards

284
00:11:21.42 --> 00:11:26.540
Syrian refugees and pay close attention

285
00:11:23.67 --> 00:11:29.070
to this speech in recent months

286
00:11:26.54 --> 00:11:31.350
Canadians have opened their hearts and

287
00:11:29.07 --> 00:11:33.810
their arms to families fleeing the

288
00:11:31.35 --> 00:11:36.449
ongoing conflict in Syria and from the

289
00:11:33.81 --> 00:11:39.390
moment they arrived those 31 thousand

290
00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:42.480
refugees were welcomed not as burdens

291
00:11:39.39 --> 00:11:47.100
but as neighbors and friends as new

292
00:11:42.48 --> 00:11:49.170
Canadians to date 40,000 Syrian refugees

293
00:11:47.1 --> 00:11:50.880
have arrived in Canada almost half of

294
00:11:49.17 --> 00:11:53.310
them thanks to the sponsorship of

295
00:11:50.88 --> 00:11:54.990
Canadian citizens have committed to be

296
00:11:53.31 --> 00:11:58.649
responsible and looking after their

297
00:11:54.99 --> 00:12:00.990
wellness this is a great example of

298
00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:03.660
solidarity but hey I mean it's one thing

299
00:12:00.99 --> 00:12:06.630
being kind and generous and well it's

300
00:12:03.66 --> 00:12:07.920
quite another to be naive but consider

301
00:12:06.63 --> 00:12:09.600
this the Canadian government has

302
00:12:07.92 --> 00:12:11.670
announced its intention to increase

303
00:12:09.6 --> 00:12:14.880
military spending by more than 70

304
00:12:11.67 --> 00:12:17.279
percent from now until 2024 in order to

305
00:12:14.88 --> 00:12:18.020
create a more agile and modern Armed

right especially if you consider that

312
00:12:30.63 --> 00:12:35.339
this government understands the before

313
00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:37.500
starting to discuss spending you have to

314
00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:39.089
talk about wealth creation well I mean

315
00:12:37.5 --> 00:12:40.399
that's how Canada has reached its one

316

hundred and fiftieth anniversary
