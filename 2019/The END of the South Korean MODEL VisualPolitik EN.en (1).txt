2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,310
the year is 1955 South Korea is a

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,289
corrupt and unstable country that

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,580
depends heavily on foreign aid

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,050
devastated by the war South Korea was at

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,880
the time the third poorest country in

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,399
all of Asia its per capita income

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,620
equaled that of African countries such

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,110
as Ghana and it was enduring the highest

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,570
inflation and lowest growth rate in the

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,930
entire region ruled with an iron fist by

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,820
the authoritarian General Park chung-hee

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,550
from 1961 expectations for this country

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,129
were not great South Korea in the 60s

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:51,719
was a country of emigrants since even

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,280
its northern neighbor looks more

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,059
promising just a second because that's

18
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,150
certainly not how things look today

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,070

kpop k-beauty k-fashion and cave dramas

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,180

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,580
right there my magical pronunciation

28

dictionary doesn't have it and I'm not

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,860
up to scratch on South Korean culture

30
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,630
now don't think that it's only culture

31
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,550
that has been exported not at all South

32
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,710
Korean companies such as Samsung Hyundai

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,960
or LG have also extended their tentacles

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,320

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:58,799
please

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,049
and that's no small feat South Korea has

40
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,609
been one of the greatest economic

41
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,829
success stories of all time in a little

42
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,659
over three decades that's just one

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,060
generation South Korea went from being a

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,979
third world country to becoming one of

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,420
the richest and most prosperous

46
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,930

[Music]

48
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,040
so the question is how did South Korea

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,810
manage this development how did it

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,700
manage to become such a rich country

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,530
well actually no that's not the question

52
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,210
we're going to be answering today

53
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,980
because what we've already answered that

54
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,330
question in another video which I'm

55
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,040
gonna link to in the description in a

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
nutshell it was thanks to the unique

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,830
South Korean developer model which is

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,840
characterized by large industrial groups

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,490
the key balls along with a very

60
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,200
demanding educational system and open

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,250
approach to the world at large

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,290
accumulation of capital and active

63
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,300
technological absorption policies and

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,220
this all led to the so-called South

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:56,200
Korean economic miracle

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,900
in 2017 this man won at the elections

67
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,180
the current president moon jae-in with a

68
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,340
fistful of new policies that he promised

69
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,290
would turn South Korea's economic model

70
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,700
around and we aren't talking about

71
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,040
conventional policies far from it

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640
so listen up

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,380
[Music]

74
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,810
an exhausted model

75
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,000
yes nowadays South Korea is one of the

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,250
richest countries on the planet and its

77
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,020
economy it continues to grow but his

78
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,910
model is flawed and many indicators show

79
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,340
a negative trend for example it is

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,590
expected that in 2019 the country will

81
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,390
record the lowest growth of the last

82
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,550
seven years its unemployment registered

83
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,590
a nine year low in January wages aren't

84
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,760
increasing and young people are finding

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,739
it harder and harder to get a job none

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,540
of this has been very common in South

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,290
Korea over the last thirty years

88
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,360
unfortunately because we ourselves do

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,820
not see the future of Korea as so rosy I

90
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,610
do not want to bring up children in the

92
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,650

00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,750
cause for concern right well the hold on

96
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,800
a minute because there's a whole lot

97
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,290
more

99
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:20,090
households South Korean families

100
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,039
accumulate debt equivalent to almost a

101
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,330
hundred percent of the gross domestic

102
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,949
product which makes them the most

103
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,470
leveraged households in any country in

104
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,930
the world because yes South Koreans do

105
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,539
save a lot but they also invest a lot

106
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:37,400
especially in housing and on top of that

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,830
most jobs are so unproductive that the

108
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,360
workday extends well into the evening

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,099

121
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,740
model is quite unsustainable and this

122
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,930
it's just the tip of the iceberg you see

123
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,639
the South Korean economy has some

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,229
characteristics that we need to take

125
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:29,479
into account on the one hand South

126
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,669
Korea's economy is divided so to speak

127
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,729
into two main parts there's the huge key

128
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,949
bars which are extremely important the

129
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,689
ten largest groups alone generate more

130
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,580
than 40 percent of its GDP actually

131
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,559
forty four point two percent in 2018

132
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,569
these groups are received favors and

133
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,069
privileges from the government's they

134
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,870
control financial institutions and they

135
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,430
have behaviors that seek to limit

136
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,369
competition within the country

137
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:54,110
then there's the SMEs that's the small

138
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,849
and medium-sized enterprises more than

139
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:57,770
3.5 million people have companies that

140
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,930
have no privileges and are subject to

141
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,120
the enormous power key boss this is a

142
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,339
situation that has very significant

143
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:09,009
consequences

144
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:12,050
for example the average SME salary which

145
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,789
is what most South Koreans earn is

146
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,800
approximately half that of the large

147
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,020
company salaries and all the gap it just

148
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,870
keeps on growing why well because among

149
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,669
other things the big key balls behave in

150
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,470
a monopolistic way and there are many

151
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,449
suspicions of collusion between these

152
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:35,690
groups and various politicians it goes

153
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,360
something like this the directors of one

154
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,979
large group agree with the directors of

155
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,900
another group and get some politicians

156
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,190
involved in order to limit the

157
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,780
competition and share the market between

158
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,880
them faced with this situation you can

159
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,440
already imagine that the power of our

160
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,960
SMEs is enormous if they don't accept

161
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,940
the key balls conditions they simply

162
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,240
have to shut down and this isn't just a

163
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,830
matter of salary differences in recent

164
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,150
years the number of SMEs that have

165
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,440
declared bankruptcy has grown

166
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,130
exponentially as if that weren't enough

167
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,020
the technological development of

168
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,599
countries like China is also increasing

169
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,340
competition and putting pressure on the

170
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,110
South Korean economy which is extremely

171
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:22,090
dependent on exports

172
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,469
well this is causing the key balls to

173
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,060
transfer part of their production to

174
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,500
other countries and replace local

175
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,770
suppliers with foreign suppliers Korean

176
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,780
companies can't compete with China and

177
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,569
India on price and should move up the

178
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:37,250
value chain but the industrial evolution

179
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,439
towards higher value-added products is

180
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,539
not happening in the SME sector because

181
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,759
of their reliance on the conglomerates

182
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,009
Park sung in an economics professor at

183
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,409
Seoul National University to see an

184
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,849
example of this we need look no further

185
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:58,699
than the automotive industry South Korea

186
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,289
is one of the largest car manufacturers

187
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,509
in the world but in spite of the surge

188
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,250
that the sector has experienced in

189
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,879
recent years

190
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,620
South Korean production has been falling

191
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,449
for the last three consecutive years

192
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,400
why because founder which controls

193
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,900
seventy percent of the national market

194
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,580
is moving its production and suppliers

195
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,860
to countries like Mexico and India in

196
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,419
the end folks the privileges that the

197
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,129
government is given to these groups and

198
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,750
the actions that they have taken to

199
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,430
limit competition have meant that most

200
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,620
jobs are tied to unproductive companies

201
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,389
with little efficiency and little

202
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,019
investments in research and innovation

203
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,539
and of course if you don't have those

204
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,010
things then you can't compete with

205
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,990
countries like China or Vietnam which

206
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,180
have much lower labor costs and all of

207
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,250
this well is generating a lot of fear in

208
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,800
South Korea thus it was precisely first

209
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,510
promise to solve these problems that

210
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,350
moon jae-in

211
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,420
the current president won the elections

212
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,540
in 2017 and you know what he's got a bit

213
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,160
of an unconventional plan so how does

214
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,649
moon jae-in want to rescue South Korea

moon Jane has promised to reform South

219
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,190
Korea's economic model from top to

220
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,440
bottom he isn't planning on doing it

221
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,240
with the typical solutions of lower

222
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,520
taxes or less regulation in fact quite

223
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,210
the opposite

224
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,860
the South Korean president's plan is

225
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,260
based fundamentally on two pillars the

226
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,970
first consists of what its support is

227
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,520
called democratizing the economy in

228
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,980
practice this consists of raising taxes

229
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,360
increasing public spending public

230
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,400
employments and the minimum wage and

231
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
this isn't exactly happening in small

232
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,000
quantities see in 2019 public spending

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,040
will grow by more than 10 percent which

234
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,290
is the largest increase in a decade on

235
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,580
the other hand the minimum wage grew by

236
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,890
sixteen point four percent in 2018 and

237
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,320
in 2019 will rise by an additional ten

238
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,850
point nine percent can the government

239
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,430
has already said that the raises they're

240
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,810
not going to end there in order to

241
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,610
finance more state spending in the

242
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,190
hiring of 850,000 new public employees

243
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,080
moon jaein has boosted the corporate

244
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,840
profits tax which will go from 22 to 25

245
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,520
percent and he's also going to raise

246
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,130
taxes on the highest wages

247
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,990
the idea that the government has is that

248
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,790
all these measures will raise families

249
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,040
income ends with its consumption this

250
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,569
would reduce the dependence of South

251
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,850
Korean companies on exports the problem

252
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,399
while folks it's just not working see

253
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,170
since moon jae-in began taking these

254
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,850
measures the economy has begun to slow

255
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,560
down unemployment has started to grow

256
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,060
and to top it all off lower family

257
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,509
incomes are actually falling yep you

258
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,829
heard that right their salaries are

259
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,480
increasing but many workers have lost

260
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,399
their jobs so the net result is the 20%

261
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,139
of families with fewer resources and

262
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,240
less money today than they did before

263
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,370
the minimum wage rise all this explains

264
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,959
why the president's approval ratings

265
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,480
have dropped from 84 percent in mid 2017

266
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,420
to 45 percent today the folks before we

267
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,250
finish there's another great pillar in

268
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,990
the South Korean president's strategy

269
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,060
and we need to look at it now so listen

270
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,440

folks the South Korean president is

274
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,810
convinced that his country's future

275
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,380
involves North Korea we are at the

276
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,209
historical start line toward common

277
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:30,279
prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and

278
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,890
Northeast Asia this is an opportunity

279
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,470
that has come like a miracle it is a

280
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,020
chance that we should never miss moon

jae-in's plans for North Korea he wants

285
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,560
to promote three large economic belts to

286
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
connect South Korea's industrial core

287
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,250

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,960
investments needed to implement just the

291
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,970
new trains would amount to more than 40

billion dollars Korea anticipates that

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,820
the trans-siberian railway will again

reach Busan the southern tip of the

while giving his companies access to

304
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,110
North Korea's resources and labor see

305
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,520
it's estimated that North Korean workers

306
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,220
monthly salary is around $60 which is

307
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,080
much less than what Chinese or

308
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,110
Vietnamese workers charge for Samsung

309
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,060
Electronics North Korea is a good

310
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,040
candidate to set up production lines

311
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,080
because it can offer cheap labor has no

312
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,000

the problem well moon jae-in isn't

316
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,750
having much luck here either while

317
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,490
negotiations between North Korea and the

318
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,680
United States going slowly South Korean

319
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,210
companies aren't convinced about

320
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,370
investing billions of dollars in North

321
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,660
Korea in the short term especially

322
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,279
because they don't trust Kim Jong Un's

323
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,850
regime I know there's the last question

324
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,310
he was going to pay the huge price tag

325
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,170
required to carry out these plans

326
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,120
so to recap this is the recipe with

327
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,100
which moon jae-in wants to transform the

328
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,080
South Korean economic model more taxes

329
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,850
more public spending more public

330
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,620
employments higher minimum wages and

331
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,780
