to change Brazil the fifth largest

bottom in an attempts to turn it into a

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,520
political and economic power however

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,680
both scenarios first 100 days into his

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,579

busan RO brazil's apprentice president

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,170
unless he stops provoking and learns to

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,990
govern his tenure could be short the

president Bolson ro is continued with

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,430
his incendiary and controversial

23
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,320
campaign speech he remains very active

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,750
in social networks in there's no day in

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,759
which he doesn't attack other parties

26
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,770
and other politicians which is strange

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,390
considering that he himself has been in

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,580
politics for 30 years and has three

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,360
children who are also politicians my god

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,820
what have I done to deserve this nothing

31
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,479
but trouble

32
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,909
yeah your bull Senado now how can you

33
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,490
use controversy to govern a country how

34
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,469
can you secure power without seeking

35
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,450
pacts or political supports and the most

36
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,039
important resident of all what exactly

37
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,159
can we expect from bolson ro well listen

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,550
up

39
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:40,100

00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,880
for Brazil in the second rounds after a

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,860
very heated campaign that caught global

45
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,480
attention and in which the current

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,340
presidents was even stabbed

47
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,770
Walden ro finally won majority support

48
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,690
from Brazilian voters specifically he

49
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,460
won fifty five point one three percent

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,800
of the vote his victory dethroned the

51
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,750
Workers Party Lula da Silva's party a

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,730
party that had completely dominated

53
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:21,390
Brazilian politics for 16 years

54
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,190
Walden ro is character known this harsh

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,080
speech for his support of the military

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,820
dictatorship and his controversial

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,040
comments in many cases comments of a

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,350
homophobic sexist and even racist nature

59
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,910
he promised he ends the extensive

60
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,620
corruption that has been ravaging Brazil

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,390
to fight relentlessly against the

62
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,310
violence that has turned Brazil into one

63
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,720
of the most dangerous countries in the

64
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,190
world indeed fifty to sixty five

65
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,870
thousand people are murdered there every

66
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,170
single year and of course to dismantle

67
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,240
the gigantic political framework that is

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,610
currently crippling Brazil's society and

69
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,120
economy it was precisely his economic

70
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,410
promises that generated the most

71
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,450
excitement during his campaign causing

72
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,440
many liberals to side with balsan ro

73
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,060
intern balsan re delegated the economic

74
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,920
section to a group of Chicago boys led

75
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,270
by the Minister of Economy Paulo G DES

76
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,770
and it makes sense to overhaul the

77
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,420
economy because Brazil can't keep

78
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,640
running like it has been running it hold

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,750
on a moment because although ball

80
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,610
scenario 1 the presidential elections he

81
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,920
doesn't hold a legislative majority his

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,440
party only got fifty five of the 513

83
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,209
seats that make up the Chamber of

84
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,980
Deputies and this is important because

85
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,480
if you don't have a majority in the

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,430
legislature and you don't seek political

87
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,500
support from other elected parties well

88
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,180
how are you going to get any laws

89
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,860
approved

[Music]

91
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,500
Brazil's Congress and Senate are very

92
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,239
fragmented which is why previous

93
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,950
Brazilian presidents have traditionally

94
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,110
ruled by forming pacts with other groups

95
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,959
this is known as coalition presidential

96
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,520
ism however balsan on route simply

97
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,810
doesn't work that way

98
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,370
and of course this isn't the only

99
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,260
handicap of the new Brazilian President

100
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,630
[Music]

101
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,830
Z to say hard to do

102
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,720
Brazil is chaotic it's by far one of the

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,519
most bureaucratic and complicated

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,060
countries in the world and it's that way

105
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,919
for everyone ordinary people companies

106
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,810
since even for politicians you want an

107
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,850
example of what bureaucracy means in

108
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,530
Brazil well check this out it's

109
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,000
estimated that a medium-sized company

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,300
even a small company spends about 2,000

111
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,150
hours a year declaring their taxes this

112
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,370
may help explain why Brazil scores lower

113
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,410
than even Argentina in the economic

114
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,970

115
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,680
one of the seven countries in the world

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,840
where taxes and most cumbersome to pay

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,220

120
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,270
and on top of that taxes aren't even low

121
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,520
in fact quite the opposite in short is

122
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,319
all just a bit of a crazy system the

123
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,759
point is that it feels like bolson are

124
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,870
is lack of evidence is taking its toll

[Music]

126
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,370
it may be surprising to hear Molson re

127
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,260
described as inexperienced when he's

128
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,940
been in politics in more than 30 years

129
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,220
and almost all that time he served as a

130
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,320
federal deputy however this time was

131
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,180
served in what Brazilian politics calls

132
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,640
low clergy that is politicians with

133
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,230
minimal power these are characters who

134
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,540
are in politics but who neither have the

135
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,580
ability to influence nor take part in

136
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,480
actual decision-making while the fact is

137
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
that since he was appointed president

138
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,380
Bolton ro hasn't had a clear agenda his

139
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,270
first months in office have been sort of

140
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,800
a sequence of meaningless fights

141
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,960
controversial statements sudden changes

142
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,390
of opinion may etcetra etcetra along the

143
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,980
way two ministers have already been

144
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,750
fired and all of this has happened in

145
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,950
just three months

146
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,720
so apart from attacking the press which

147
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
happens all the time we don't really

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,410
know what it will be up to you from one

149
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,300
day to the next and of course some

150
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,310
important ideas have been discussed such

151
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,710
as commemorating the 1964 coup that led

152
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,600
to the dictatorship it's almost as if he

153
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,950
thinks that Brazil doesn't have any more

154
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,540
pressing matters than opening up these

155
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,770

came to power as a champion in the fight

159

Senator Flavio bolson RA received 48

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,910

166
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,590

electoral funds by bowl scenarios social

168
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,000
Liberal Party to fake candidates in the

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,290
previous elections these accusations led

170
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,580
to the dismissal of the general

campaign not exactly a brilliant start

175
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,800
and this helps to explain how in just

176
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,210
three months the president's approval

177
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,340
rating among Brazilians dropped 16

178
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,710

from 62 percent in January to 49 percent

180
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,210
in March look we're talking about the

181
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,340
worst record of a Brazilian president at

182
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,770
the beginning of his term since 1990 but

183
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,510

186
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,240
different from governing a country for

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,460
between parties and politicians whose

190
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,380
only affinity is their rejection of a

191
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,040
different political opinion that's

192
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,990
exactly what happened in Brazil Multan

193
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,460
RA managed to bring together all the

194
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,780
different groups that were fed up with

195
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,760
the workers party's policies however

196
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,830
there's one problem once you reach power

197
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,960
and you have to govern that's when the

198
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,480
differences really begin to show this is

199
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,220
what seems to be happening in Brazil

200
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,010
right now

201
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,930
you see the support system the lead ball

202
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,060
scenario to the presidency includes just

203
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,980
a bit of everything anti Marxists

204
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,380
evangelists liberals traditionalists the

205
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,080
military conservatives it goes on and on

206
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,150
and of course sometimes the differences

207
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,010
they really do matter in a nutshell we

208
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,510
could say that there are two main

209
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,700
currents within balsan aras governments

210
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,880
pragmatists and ideologists among the

211
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,680
pragmatists who are those groups willing

212
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,390
to negotiate with other political forces

213
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,220
of the military and the Liberals for

214
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,720
example the liberal group led by the

215
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,880
powerful economy minister Pablo guita's

216
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,920
defended much more aggressive reforms

217
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,450
during the campaign than those it

218
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,100
defends now that there empower and

219
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,930
that's because they need support in

220
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,979
order to get those reforms through a

221
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,540
very clear example is pension reform

222
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,890
during the campaign be des defended

223
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,510
reforming the entire system using the

224
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,430
Chilean model as an example in short he

225
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,180
was promoting a capitalization model now

226
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,800
however he's promoting significant

227
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,050
reforms but they are nowhere near as

228
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,180
ambitious a minimum retirement age a

229
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,250
capped pension and eligibility based on

230
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,020
a required number of years in the

231
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,400
workforce the governments will still

232
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,500
save a lot of money but basically the

233
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,620
system structure will remain the same

234
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,810
and of course in order to approve even a

235
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,760
moderate pension system reform they need

236
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,500
three-fifths of the congressmen and

237
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,080
Senators to vote in favor so while it's

238
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,730
time to negotiate the second current

239
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,570
that runs through all scenarios

240
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,940
governments is the ideological one and

241
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,470
this group includes the president's own

242
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,300
children as I mentioned the entire

243
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,610
family is involved in politics

244
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,920
I've never seen anything like it I don't

245
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,540
remember any other government in which

246
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,910
the family has so much power as this one

247
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,070
family is always a problem the president

248
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,870
needs to keep some distance from his

249
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,970
family and friends Fernando Henrique

250
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,850
Cardoso former president of Brazil the

251
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,740
fact is that the ideologists are the

252
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,600
least willing to negotiate or seek

253
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,500
consensus

254
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,230
it's piloted by this man olavo de

255
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,540
Carvalho balsan Aras Steve Bannon he's a

256
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,160
self-taught writer and philosopher who

257
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,350
lives in the United States and is pretty

258
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,240
extreme he's part of what's known as the

259
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,760
old right and well his approaches are a

260
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,890
cocktail loaded with anti-communism anti

261
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,990
globalism anti cultural Marxism

262
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,960
anti-lgbt and a a whole lot of

263
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,820
conservatism this character has even

264
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,100
criticized the pragmatic leaders in both

265
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,530
scenarios government a la ville de

266
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,230
Carvajal qualifies manaro the Vice

267
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,120
President as an idiot and says the

268
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,190
government is running badly yes that's

269
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,750
right there are already clashes between

270
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,460
the groups that make up the governments

271
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,830
and if that's within the government you

272
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,510
can imagine how hard it will be to find

273
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,860
agreements with the rest of the

274
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,660
parliamentary forces in fact in just

275
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,830
three months the government has already

276
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,020
been defeated several times in Congress

277
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,460
but folks we still need to talk about

278
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:48,619
balsa narrows that handicap

279
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:54,029
the economy doesn't work we should state

280
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,709
that this isn't Bowl senarios fault as

281
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,539
it seems fundamentally from the disaster

282
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:59,189
caused by the previous government the

283
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,199
Workers Party which led Brazil into one

284
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:06,359
of its worst crises in 2016 but even if

285
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,799
it's not their fault ball scenarios

286
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,269
government is going to have to deal with

287
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,069
it and work with an economy that's not

288
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,169
the forming basically the country has a

289
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:15,749
huge public deficit of between 7 & 8

290
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:23,419
percent per year

291
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,410
public debt keeps growing and it's

292
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,389
already at around 80 percent which is a

293
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,339
lot for a country like Brazil to make

294
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,169
matters worse there are 13 million

295
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,939
unemployed people and the economy is

296
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:36,569
really struggling City cuts 2019 Brazil

297
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,779
GDP growth forecast 1.8 percent faced

298
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,579
with this situation Brazil doesn't need

299
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,679
an economy minister they need a doctor

300
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,660
obviously such a big deficit doesn't

301
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,339
give the government much margin for

302
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,379
anything and if you have huge imbalances

303
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,939
and no growth things are only gonna get

304
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,189
harder of course this only one solution

305
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:58,049
and that's budget cuts and that's

306
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,339
precisely what the government wants to

307
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,199
do with pensions which is by far the

308
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,699
largest expenditure for the Brazilian

309
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,470
governments more than 40% of the

310
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,269
government's budget goes to pensions and

311
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:08,100
some estimates even suggest that in the

312
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,019
next decade this is going to rise above

313
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:14,100
60% this is not surprising because

314
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,509
Brazil has one of the most generous

315
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,009
systems in the world the country's

316
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:19,589
average retirement age is 54 years and

317
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,749
the average pension is equivalent to 70%

318
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,819
of the final salary that means you can

319
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,619
retire at age 54 and for the rest of

320
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,419
your life you're going to get 70% of the

321
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,220
salary you were earning just before you

322
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,199
retired obviously this is not

323
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,289
sustainable Brazil has one of the most

324
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:35,699
generous systems in the world

325
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:37,739
if there is no pension reform Brazil

326
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:40,049
will head towards insolvency and a debt

327
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,899
crisis Chris Garmin managing director of

328
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,970
Eurasia Group a political risk advisory

329
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,369
firm the rolling cuts then ever-popular

330
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,139
and folks at Bolton re-really wants to

331
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,549
change Raziel for good he's going to

332
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:53,009
have to negotiate and that means a lot

333
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,559
of compromise the question is can he do

334
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,609
it well leave your answer in the

335
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,129
comments below and in this survey anyway

336
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:00,959
as you could see these are factors that

337
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,939
have overshadowed Bowl scenarios first

338
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,769
months as president if he manages to

339
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,569
build a coalition of political support

340
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,579
to transform the Brazilian economy well

341
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,379
were we glad to tell you about it and if

342
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,359
he doesn't his government may not last

343
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,949
