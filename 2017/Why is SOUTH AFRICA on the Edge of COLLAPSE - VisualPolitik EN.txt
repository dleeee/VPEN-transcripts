it is known as the rainbow nation for

3
00:00:10.05 --> 00:00:14.219
its cultural linguistic and religious

00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:18.869
diversity its constitution alone

acknowledges 11 different languages yes

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.710
this is South Africa a country situated

7
00:00:20.88 --> 00:00:27.990
in the extreme south of Africa this is

8
00:00:25.71 --> 00:00:29.939
not a small country its surface area is

9
00:00:27.99 --> 00:00:32.820
larger than Germany France Italy Belgium

10
00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.710
and the Netherlands combined it is by

11
00:00:32.82 --> 00:00:36.570
far the most developed economy of all

12
00:00:34.71 --> 00:00:38.850
the countries situated south of the

13
00:00:36.57 --> 00:00:41.190
Sahara Desert in the year 2000 again it

14
00:00:38.85 --> 00:00:43.320
was the first African country to hold a

15
00:00:41.19 --> 00:00:45.210
Soccer World Championship this was the

16
00:00:43.32 --> 00:00:48.800
Summer of Shakira's like a waka if

17
00:00:45.21 --> 00:00:48.800
anyone cares to remember that

18
00:00:50.42 --> 00:00:55.590
various important months in South

19
00:00:52.5 --> 00:00:57.899
Africa's history with April 1994 between

20
00:00:55.59 --> 00:00:59.850
the 26 and 29 of their months South

21
00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
Africa celebrated the first free

22
00:00:59.85 --> 00:01:04.229
universal and democratic elections they

23
00:01:02.55 --> 00:01:05.970
were also the longest because the

24
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.220
elections lasted for four long days

25
00:01:05.97 --> 00:01:10.290
during that time South Africans last

26
00:01:08.22 --> 00:01:16.650
thousand massively to vote having to

27
00:01:10.29 --> 00:01:18.810
wait in queues at kilometres long live

28
00:01:16.65 --> 00:01:21.659
was justified for these elections meant

29
00:01:18.81 --> 00:01:24.000
the end of 300 years of colonialism and

30
00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:31.860
white supremacy the elections marked the

31
00:01:24.0 --> 00:01:33.509
end of apartheid apart by apartheid was

32
00:01:31.86 --> 00:01:36.270
a system based on racial segregation

33
00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.430
which remained in effect for 50 years it

34
00:01:36.27 --> 00:01:40.110
mainly consisted of separating the white

35
00:01:38.43 --> 00:01:42.869
population from the black population

36
00:01:40.11 --> 00:01:44.850
this applied in any situation living

37
00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.890
studying even the spending of leisure

38
00:01:44.85 --> 00:01:48.660
time obviously as you might imagine all

39
00:01:46.89 --> 00:01:50.399
of the rest areas and services were

40
00:01:48.66 --> 00:01:52.110
built for and used by the white

41
00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.759
population a good example of this with

42
00:01:52.11 --> 00:01:56.039
the ambulances even though the black

43
00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.410
population were 80% of the population

44
00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.090
they barely had any ambulances - you

45
00:01:58.41 --> 00:02:01.950
however the ambulances for the white

46
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:03.959
population were numerous and refused to

47
00:02:01.95 --> 00:02:06.810
carry any black passengers because they

48
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:11.749
couldn't according to the law

49
00:02:06.81 --> 00:02:11.749
[Music]

50
00:02:14.45 --> 00:02:18.960
apartheid gave the white population all

51
00:02:16.89 --> 00:02:21.090
the political power and also established

52
00:02:18.96 --> 00:02:23.160
many limitations precisely in order to

53
00:02:21.09 --> 00:02:25.200
consolidate that white power as an

54
00:02:23.16 --> 00:02:27.060
example mixed-race relationships and

55
00:02:25.2 --> 00:02:28.830
marriage were completely forbidden quite

56
00:02:27.06 --> 00:02:31.000
simply it left the black population in

57
00:02:28.83 --> 00:02:35.129
an inhumane situation

58
00:02:31.0 --> 00:02:35.129
[Music]

59
00:02:35.17 --> 00:02:38.830
it can be said that there were two

60
00:02:36.85 --> 00:02:40.569
different South Africa's one black and

61
00:02:38.83 --> 00:02:42.250
terribly poor and the other white and

62
00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.410
very wealthy and of course those who

63
00:02:42.25 --> 00:02:47.020
rebelled suffered terrible punishments

64
00:02:44.41 --> 00:02:48.940
and repression on the 16th of June 1976

65
00:02:47.02 --> 00:02:51.520
thousands of black students went on a

66
00:02:48.94 --> 00:02:53.680
demonstration to demand social and

67
00:02:51.52 --> 00:02:54.459
educated improvement hundreds of them

68
00:02:53.68 --> 00:02:56.410
were massacred

69
00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.170
I've got injured in my back I have a sky

70
00:02:56.41 --> 00:03:02.290
in my back I was running about the train

71
00:02:59.17 --> 00:03:06.060
speed sounded here fighting away from

72
00:03:02.29 --> 00:03:06.060
there from the police

73
00:03:06.75 --> 00:03:12.430
Mandela dreams but all that changed in

74
00:03:11.25 --> 00:03:14.620
1994

75
00:03:12.43 --> 00:03:16.870
thanks to Nelson Mandela also known as

76
00:03:14.62 --> 00:03:18.540
Madiba he was considered the father of

77
00:03:16.87 --> 00:03:20.920
the country

78
00:03:18.54 --> 00:03:23.200
Mandela led the political fight against

79
00:03:20.92 --> 00:03:25.480
apartheid and racism that he had to pay

80
00:03:23.2 --> 00:03:27.610
for it in 1961 he was sentenced to life

81
00:03:25.48 --> 00:03:31.510
imprisonment for the trail Mandela spent

82
00:03:27.61 --> 00:03:34.209
27 years in jail until 1992 nevertheless

83
00:03:31.51 --> 00:03:35.590
two years after his release in 1994

84
00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.120
during the country's first free

85
00:03:35.59 --> 00:03:38.680
elections he was elected as the

86
00:03:37.12 --> 00:03:42.660
president of South Africa the first

87
00:03:38.68 --> 00:03:42.660
black president in the country's history

88
00:03:43.41 --> 00:03:47.709
after this happens many were surprised

89
00:03:45.79 --> 00:03:50.290
to see Mandela aiming for reconciliation

90
00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.900
rather than revenge and dela dreamt of a

91
00:03:50.29 --> 00:03:54.519
free United and prosperous South Africa

92
00:03:52.9 --> 00:03:57.489
he made it clear in his inaugural speech

93
00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.590
we have first in the effort to implant

94
00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.170
hope in the press on the middle of our

95
00:03:59.59 --> 00:04:04.750
people we enter into a covenant that was

96
00:04:02.17 --> 00:04:07.630
until to society in which all South

97
00:04:04.75 --> 00:04:11.320
Africans both black and white will be

98
00:04:07.63 --> 00:04:14.350
able to atone without any skill in Jihad

99
00:04:11.32 --> 00:04:17.140
a third of the action Ahmir the

100
00:04:14.35 --> 00:04:19.539
providers imagine a rainbow nation at

101
00:04:17.14 --> 00:04:21.700
peace with the Sun and the world

102
00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.530
Mandela kept his work he worked towards

103
00:04:21.7 --> 00:04:25.510
the United South Africa and when the

104
00:04:23.53 --> 00:04:27.250
time came he left power following the

105
00:04:25.51 --> 00:04:29.200
limits of the Constitution this all

106
00:04:27.25 --> 00:04:33.430
turned him into a legend for the country

107
00:04:29.2 --> 00:04:36.850
what is robbed a survey the past is the

108
00:04:33.43 --> 00:04:38.770
past we look to the future now

109
00:04:36.85 --> 00:04:40.810
well let's now focus on present-day

110
00:04:38.77 --> 00:04:43.000
South Africa it is the only country in

111
00:04:40.81 --> 00:04:44.590
the world to have three capital cities

112
00:04:43.0 --> 00:04:46.870
Cape Town the capital city for

113
00:04:44.59 --> 00:04:48.680
legislative power Pretoria for executive

114
00:04:46.87 --> 00:04:50.600
power and in bloom Fontaine see

115
00:04:48.68 --> 00:04:52.820
judicial capital city and on top of all

116
00:04:50.6 --> 00:04:54.350
that neither is the most populated or

117
00:04:52.82 --> 00:04:56.360
the one where most businesses

118
00:04:54.35 --> 00:05:00.620
concentrate to that we have to move to a

119
00:04:56.36 --> 00:05:02.660
fourth city Johannesburg it's even not

120
00:05:00.62 --> 00:05:04.460
uncommon for different textbooks to stay

121
00:05:02.66 --> 00:05:06.169
two different cities and the capital of

122
00:05:04.46 --> 00:05:08.330
South Africa now after the fall of

123
00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.449
apartheid South Africa experienced quite

124
00:05:08.33 --> 00:05:16.090
an economic boost since 1994 the economy

125
00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.090
considering purchasing power has tripled

126
00:05:16.11 --> 00:05:21.259
[Music]

127
00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.270
poverty has been strongly reduced and

128
00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.220
hundreds of thousands of black families

129
00:05:23.27 --> 00:05:27.139
make it into the middle class every

130
00:05:25.22 --> 00:05:29.300
single year and even though violence is

131
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.160
still high it does need to be said that

132
00:05:29.3 --> 00:05:33.650
South Africa is quite a violent country

133
00:05:31.16 --> 00:05:35.210
it has also been reduced further in

134
00:05:33.65 --> 00:05:37.039
general the access to drinkable water

135
00:05:35.21 --> 00:05:38.960
electricity and health care has also

136
00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.120
improved quite a lot to illustrate the

137
00:05:38.96 --> 00:05:43.280
situation South Africa is the biggest

138
00:05:41.12 --> 00:05:44.900
tourist center and financial power in

139
00:05:43.28 --> 00:05:46.880
the south of the continent its stock

140
00:05:44.9 --> 00:05:48.800
market is the most important in Africa

141
00:05:46.88 --> 00:05:50.720
and it is also an important place for

142
00:05:48.8 --> 00:05:53.030
the automotive industry companies such

143
00:05:50.72 --> 00:05:55.699
as BMW and General Motors have factories

144
00:05:53.03 --> 00:05:57.560
here so it all sounds pretty good right

145
00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.960
well thanks today are actually not

146
00:05:57.56 --> 00:06:04.220
looking that rosy crazies and defamation

147
00:06:01.96 --> 00:06:06.860
despite its numerous achievements the

148
00:06:04.22 --> 00:06:08.900
economy hasn't changed since 2009 the

149
00:06:06.86 --> 00:06:10.400
economy isn't growing unemployment rates

150
00:06:08.9 --> 00:06:12.289
are one of the highest in the world and

151
00:06:10.4 --> 00:06:14.570
in general very few people are working

152
00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.699
the country has a population of about 55

153
00:06:14.57 --> 00:06:18.320
million people 15 million of which are

154
00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.840
without work and many of the jobs that

155
00:06:18.32 --> 00:06:23.210
the people do have are informal and this

156
00:06:20.84 --> 00:06:24.889
is not the only problem investment by

157
00:06:23.21 --> 00:06:26.810
companies has also kept the decreasing

158
00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.820
in the last nine years its currency the

159
00:06:26.81 --> 00:06:30.710
rands has also greatly depreciated and

160
00:06:28.82 --> 00:06:33.169
public debt is about to be declared as

161
00:06:30.71 --> 00:06:35.150
junk bonds this is a pretty major

162
00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.800
economic disaster in fact in the last

163
00:06:35.15 --> 00:06:38.599
year's people with money have begun

164
00:06:36.8 --> 00:06:41.300
leaving the country so the big question

165
00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:44.110
is what happens in South Africa what led

166
00:06:41.3 --> 00:06:44.110
to this crisis

167
00:06:44.84 --> 00:06:50.970
yes customer this is Jacob Zuma he's

168
00:06:48.84 --> 00:06:53.250
been in office since 2009 and his years

169
00:06:50.97 --> 00:06:56.940
in office have been well they've been a

170
00:06:53.25 --> 00:06:58.590
giant mess the man is facing a 783

171
00:06:56.94 --> 00:07:00.390
corruption cases and he has been

172
00:06:58.59 --> 00:07:02.670
described at being a professional at

173
00:07:00.39 --> 00:07:04.920
taking things that are not his South

174
00:07:02.67 --> 00:07:07.590
Africa's main opposition party is

175
00:07:04.92 --> 00:07:10.170
accusing President Jacob Zuma of

176
00:07:07.59 --> 00:07:12.930
flagrant abuse of public money they've a

177
00:07:10.17 --> 00:07:15.330
multi-million euro upgrade to his home

178
00:07:12.93 --> 00:07:17.880
additions to Zoomers home include a

179
00:07:15.33 --> 00:07:20.580
swimming pool cattle enclosure and an

180
00:07:17.88 --> 00:07:20.910
amphitheater but this is not the only

181
00:07:20.58 --> 00:07:22.770
issue

182
00:07:20.91 --> 00:07:24.930
mr. Zuma's political decisions don't

183
00:07:22.77 --> 00:07:26.460
encourage foreign investment so the

184
00:07:24.93 --> 00:07:28.230
president's labour regulations are an

185
00:07:26.46 --> 00:07:30.060
obstacle when it comes to job creation

186
00:07:28.23 --> 00:07:32.160
and the regulations are getting more and

187
00:07:30.06 --> 00:07:33.840
more rigid his last idea it was a huge

188
00:07:32.16 --> 00:07:35.220
raise in the minimum wage something that

189
00:07:33.84 --> 00:07:37.350
doesn't make a bunch of sense in the

190
00:07:35.22 --> 00:07:39.450
country where there are so few working

191
00:07:37.35 --> 00:07:41.190
people in fact many financial analysts

192
00:07:39.45 --> 00:07:42.990
have criticised the measure by saying

193
00:07:41.19 --> 00:07:45.180
it's nonsensical to establish a minimum

194
00:07:42.99 --> 00:07:46.950
wage which amounts to twice as much as

195
00:07:45.18 --> 00:07:48.600
half of workers are making now to be

196
00:07:46.95 --> 00:07:50.520
honest we all do want our salaries to

197
00:07:48.6 --> 00:07:53.160
raise but I think it's a better idea to

198
00:07:50.52 --> 00:07:55.320
create some wealth first if job creation

199
00:07:53.16 --> 00:07:56.640
was already an issue before imagine

200
00:07:55.32 --> 00:07:58.440
what's going to happen with higher

201
00:07:56.64 --> 00:08:00.360
salaries and the South Africa it has

202
00:07:58.44 --> 00:08:02.660
other problems too an important one is

203
00:08:00.36 --> 00:08:04.150
it's problematic education system

204
00:08:02.66 --> 00:08:06.580
[Applause]

205
00:08:04.15 --> 00:08:11.810
[Music]

206
00:08:06.58 --> 00:08:13.940
an awful education system the education

207
00:08:11.81 --> 00:08:16.580
system in South Africa is pretty awful

208
00:08:13.94 --> 00:08:18.440
picture this one in every three students

209
00:08:16.58 --> 00:08:20.150
who is attended school for six years has

210
00:08:18.44 --> 00:08:22.370
difficulty when it comes to something as

211
00:08:20.15 --> 00:08:24.590
essential as reading and only one in

212
00:08:22.37 --> 00:08:26.570
every 100 black students gets an

213
00:08:24.59 --> 00:08:28.190
engineering diploma so we can probably

214
00:08:26.57 --> 00:08:29.810
now understand why national companies

215
00:08:28.19 --> 00:08:31.550
complain about the difficulty of finding

216
00:08:29.81 --> 00:08:33.560
skilled labor and this has got nothing

217
00:08:31.55 --> 00:08:34.490
to do with money South Africa is one of

218
00:08:33.56 --> 00:08:38.349
the countries with the highest

219
00:08:34.49 --> 00:08:38.349
investment in education in the world

220
00:08:41.26 --> 00:08:45.430
so the big question is what is happening

221
00:08:43.72 --> 00:08:47.080
well according to some people the ones

222
00:08:45.43 --> 00:08:49.150
who are to blame are the Democratic

223
00:08:47.08 --> 00:08:50.860
teachers union they control the state

224
00:08:49.15 --> 00:08:52.870
education system and it has become

225
00:08:50.86 --> 00:08:54.820
something of a mafia the union is an

226
00:08:52.87 --> 00:08:56.800
ally of President Zuma zoomer besides

227
00:08:54.82 --> 00:08:58.780
putting an end to education supervision

228
00:08:56.8 --> 00:09:00.550
has also pulls many strings to get more

229
00:08:58.78 --> 00:09:02.140
teachers into the system this has caused

230
00:09:00.55 --> 00:09:04.150
the education level of teachers

231
00:09:02.14 --> 00:09:05.920
themselves to become very low now a few

232
00:09:04.15 --> 00:09:07.660
years ago maths teachers in the country

233
00:09:05.92 --> 00:09:09.640
were given a test these features where

234
00:09:07.66 --> 00:09:11.350
teaching math to 11 and 12 year olds

235
00:09:09.64 --> 00:09:13.420
what was the result well eight out of

236
00:09:11.35 --> 00:09:16.180
these teachers got lower results than

237
00:09:13.42 --> 00:09:18.430
were expected of their student and to be

238
00:09:16.18 --> 00:09:20.860
honest here maths is not exactly one of

239
00:09:18.43 --> 00:09:24.550
President Zoomers strong suit this is

240
00:09:20.86 --> 00:09:26.380
President Zuma attempting to say 769

241
00:09:24.55 --> 00:09:30.690
thousand eight hundred and seventy seven

242
00:09:26.38 --> 00:09:33.820
hundred and sixty nine eight hundred ten

243
00:09:30.69 --> 00:09:39.700
seven hundred this intra-party eight

244
00:09:33.82 --> 00:09:41.230
hundred ten twenty now obviously the

245
00:09:39.7 --> 00:09:43.210
results for white students who go to

246
00:09:41.23 --> 00:09:44.800
private schools are far better this

247
00:09:43.21 --> 00:09:48.480
shows that maybe some of the apartheid

248
00:09:44.8 --> 00:09:48.480
heritage is still very much in effect

249
00:09:49.6 --> 00:09:55.250
we're still conflicts if these problems

250
00:09:53.03 --> 00:09:57.140
weren't bad enough racial conflict in

251
00:09:55.25 --> 00:09:58.790
South Africa has also been growing in

252
00:09:57.14 --> 00:10:00.710
the last few years the economic freedom

253
00:09:58.79 --> 00:10:03.350
fighters is a radical political party

254
00:10:00.71 --> 00:10:05.570
that was founded in 2013 this party is

255
00:10:03.35 --> 00:10:06.830
now the third largest force in the

256
00:10:05.57 --> 00:10:09.260
country some of its members are

257
00:10:06.83 --> 00:10:11.390
suggesting to almost invert apartheid

258
00:10:09.26 --> 00:10:13.160
and plan to the white population it is

259
00:10:11.39 --> 00:10:15.110
still a minority party but is an element

260
00:10:13.16 --> 00:10:17.150
of subversion it is working quite well

261
00:10:15.11 --> 00:10:19.400
so anyway it now looks as if Mandela's

262
00:10:17.15 --> 00:10:20.810
dream is now in danger so this is what

263
00:10:19.4 --> 00:10:22.160
we think here at visual politic what

264
00:10:20.81 --> 00:10:24.020
what do you think do you think the South

265
00:10:22.16 --> 00:10:25.370
Africa will continue to be few Nelson

266
00:10:24.02 --> 00:10:27.020
Mandela's Dreams do you think it will

267
00:10:25.37 --> 00:10:28.430
become the most prosperous nation in

268
00:10:27.02 --> 00:10:30.650
Africa once again what do you think

269
00:10:28.43 --> 00:10:32.420
hatred distrust and bad politics will

270
00:10:30.65 --> 00:10:34.100
triumph do let us know in the comments
