1
00:00:06.74 --> 00:00:11.250
leggo is the biggest toy manufacturer on

2
00:00:09.45 --> 00:00:13.349
the planet but nonetheless they aren't

3
00:00:11.25 --> 00:00:15.599
even on the stock market other industry

4
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.699
beer moths like Hasbro Mattel are listed

5
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.770
on the NASDAQ exchange but Lego with

6
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.930
bigger sales the presence in most of the

7
00:00:19.77 --> 00:00:25.970
world and one of the most valued brands

8
00:00:21.93 --> 00:00:25.970
keeps its status as a family business

9
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.739
and as we will see later this is one of

10
00:00:32.73 --> 00:00:36.899
these secrets to their success but not

11
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
only that unlike a competitor's Lego is

12
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.340
the best toy manufacturer when it comes

13
00:00:39.0 --> 00:00:42.960
to surviving crises so now you might be

14
00:00:41.34 --> 00:00:43.649
wondering well what Christ is exactly am

15
00:00:42.96 --> 00:00:45.720
I talking about

16
00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.460
well of course that would be the toy

17
00:00:45.72 --> 00:00:49.110
crisis remember when you were a kid and

18
00:00:47.46 --> 00:00:50.489
maybe wrote a list of things of what you

19
00:00:49.11 --> 00:00:52.110
wanted for Christmas maybe you send it

20
00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.820
to Santa Claus or someone else depending

21
00:00:52.11 --> 00:00:55.920
on where your fraud well what did you

22
00:00:53.82 --> 00:00:57.360
ask for for Christmas I'm sure many of

23
00:00:55.92 --> 00:00:59.159
you wanted things like the Playmobil

24
00:00:57.36 --> 00:01:00.960
pirate ship a house for your Barbie doll

25
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.699
or perhaps those Power Ranger action

26
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:04.619
figures that change their heads when you

27
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.720
press the button but today kids have

28
00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.720
changed their tastes dramatically

29
00:01:11.64 --> 00:01:15.240
most of the things they want for

30
00:01:13.47 --> 00:01:16.800
Christmas these days of video games and

31
00:01:15.24 --> 00:01:18.750
I don't think anybody will be surprised

32
00:01:16.8 --> 00:01:21.510
if I say that the video game industry is

33
00:01:18.75 --> 00:01:23.640
absolutely on fire these days titles

34
00:01:21.51 --> 00:01:25.410
like Call of Duty and Battlefield have a

35
00:01:23.64 --> 00:01:26.340
bigger budget than most Hollywood

36
00:01:25.41 --> 00:01:27.840
productions

37
00:01:26.34 --> 00:01:29.400
however the toy industry well that's

38
00:01:27.84 --> 00:01:35.370
going the other way and this explains

39
00:01:29.4 --> 00:01:38.280
news like this Toys R Us files for

40
00:01:35.37 --> 00:01:41.070
bankruptcy but we'll keep stores open

41
00:01:38.28 --> 00:01:43.470
yes Divya the toy industry is certainly

42
00:01:41.07 --> 00:01:45.450
in dire straits but there is an

43
00:01:43.47 --> 00:01:47.640
exception to this rule and as you might

44
00:01:45.45 --> 00:01:49.259
imagine that exception is lego two years

45
00:01:47.64 --> 00:01:50.729
ago they beat their own sales records

46
00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.860
and they've been kicking ass for the

47
00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.280
whole last decade Christmas after

48
00:01:52.86 --> 00:01:55.280
Christmas

49
00:01:56.46 --> 00:02:01.290
so the question is how is Lego surviving

50
00:01:59.13 --> 00:02:03.660
the video game industry is Lego as good

51
00:02:01.29 --> 00:02:05.610
as it seems or we may be missing some

52
00:02:03.66 --> 00:02:07.140
details here well today we are going to

53
00:02:05.61 --> 00:02:09.570
answer all of these questions but before

54
00:02:07.14 --> 00:02:12.020
we do as usual let's take a look back at

55
00:02:09.57 --> 00:02:12.020
the history

56
00:02:14.43 --> 00:02:20.219
a family business let go it started out

57
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:21.989
in a very small carpentry workshop in a

58
00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.579
village called Billings in the middle of

59
00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.859
Denmark by that time there were already

60
00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.780
some big toy companies like Parkin the

61
00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.730
creators of blockbusters like monopoly

62
00:02:30.78 --> 00:02:34.799
or the Ouija board during this time mr.

63
00:02:32.73 --> 00:02:36.989
Christiansen was manufacturing all kinds

64
00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.150
of wooden products but in 1932 he

65
00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.709
realized that specialization is the key

66
00:02:39.15 --> 00:02:42.840
to success with the help of his 8

67
00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.810
employees he started manufacturing toys

68
00:02:42.84 --> 00:02:47.489
and only toys soon his product stood out

69
00:02:45.81 --> 00:02:49.530
for their quality in fact we could

70
00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.269
summarize his work philosophy with one

71
00:02:49.53 --> 00:02:57.480
quote only the best is good enough all

72
00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.370
Kirk Christiansen founder of Lego but

73
00:02:57.48 --> 00:03:01.349
the turning point for Lego came after

74
00:02:59.37 --> 00:03:02.370
World War 2 one day a British salesman

75
00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.739
appeared in this Carpenters workshop

76
00:03:02.37 --> 00:03:06.659
with a game-changing product and this

77
00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.169
was of course plastic this brand-new

78
00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.969
material

79
00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:13.919
allowed factories to create things in a

80
00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:15.900
cheap precise and industrial way at the

81
00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.269
time the new workshop manager was mr.

82
00:03:15.9 --> 00:03:20.370
Christiansen son a man named Gottfried

83
00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.079
he immediately realized the enormous

84
00:03:20.37 --> 00:03:23.940
potential of this new material and some

85
00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.099
years later Lego licensed their now

86
00:03:23.94 --> 00:03:28.470
famous block assembly system thus and

87
00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.250
with that the most successful toy of all

88
00:03:28.47 --> 00:03:31.250
time was born

89
00:03:32.95 --> 00:03:36.820
the quality controls at Lego are so

90
00:03:35.02 --> 00:03:39.670
intense that even the blocks that are

91
00:03:36.82 --> 00:03:41.500
sold today in 2017 can be assembled with

92
00:03:39.67 --> 00:03:44.140
the ones that were sold by manufacturers

93
00:03:41.5 --> 00:03:45.670
back in 1958 and the same applies to

94
00:03:44.14 --> 00:03:47.260
their corporate philosophy if there is a

95
00:03:45.67 --> 00:03:54.220
characteristic of the Christian family

96
00:03:47.26 --> 00:03:55.810
it's that they wear lead shoes here's an

97
00:03:54.22 --> 00:03:58.090
example before they started to produce

98
00:03:55.81 --> 00:04:00.490
theses in green they spend more than 10

99
00:03:58.09 --> 00:04:02.260
years conducting studies and discussions

100
00:04:00.49 --> 00:04:03.910
other companies in the industry have no

101
00:04:02.26 --> 00:04:05.620
problem taking out loans to buy new

102
00:04:03.91 --> 00:04:08.140
factories and come up with new product

103
00:04:05.62 --> 00:04:10.030
lines but Lego was one of a kind they

104
00:04:08.14 --> 00:04:12.370
always tried to finance their expansion

105
00:04:10.03 --> 00:04:14.650
with their own profits and this explains

106
00:04:12.37 --> 00:04:16.450
why they have slower but more solid

107
00:04:14.65 --> 00:04:19.150
growth despite all of this during the

108
00:04:16.45 --> 00:04:20.799
70s and 80s Lego was on fire their

109
00:04:19.15 --> 00:04:22.300
products covered every stage of a

110
00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.370
child's development the smaller kids

111
00:04:22.3 --> 00:04:26.410
while they had Duplo blocks with vivid

112
00:04:24.37 --> 00:04:28.419
colors and bigger blocks after that

113
00:04:26.41 --> 00:04:30.550
between 5 and 15 years old you have the

114
00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.080
classic Lego pieces and finally for the

115
00:04:30.55 --> 00:04:33.730
teenagers who wanted to improve their

116
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:35.380
engineering skills there was LEGO

117
00:04:33.73 --> 00:04:36.910
Technic and let's be honest here has

118
00:04:35.38 --> 00:04:39.450
anyone not played with any of those

119
00:04:36.91 --> 00:04:39.450
products

120
00:04:39.57 --> 00:04:43.000
and if this was not enough Lego had its

121
00:04:42.13 --> 00:04:45.070
own theme park

122
00:04:43.0 --> 00:04:50.170
the famous Legoland these were another

123
00:04:45.07 --> 00:04:52.090
money-making machines but hold on a

124
00:04:50.17 --> 00:04:55.140
minute because in the 90s things they

125
00:04:52.09 --> 00:04:55.140
went a little sour

126
00:04:55.88 --> 00:05:01.380
demographic crisis the 1960s are known

127
00:04:59.43 --> 00:05:03.720
as the baby boom couples in Europe and

128
00:05:01.38 --> 00:05:05.340
America had lots and lots of babies and

129
00:05:03.72 --> 00:05:07.290
this meant that during the 70s and 80s

130
00:05:05.34 --> 00:05:09.000
there were enough kids to sustain the

131
00:05:07.29 --> 00:05:10.950
toy manufacturing industry nonetheless

132
00:05:09.0 --> 00:05:15.330
the 90s they were totally different

133
00:05:10.95 --> 00:05:17.250
animals all of a sudden families had

134
00:05:15.33 --> 00:05:18.900
less kid and as you can imagine this was

135
00:05:17.25 --> 00:05:20.880
a bad thing for a company like Lego

136
00:05:18.9 --> 00:05:22.770
every year they sold less than the

137
00:05:20.88 --> 00:05:24.450
previous one and no matter how many fun

138
00:05:22.77 --> 00:05:26.580
parks they opened in the United States

139
00:05:24.45 --> 00:05:28.920
profits kept getting lower and lower

140
00:05:26.58 --> 00:05:31.700
these were bad times for Lego and the

141
00:05:28.92 --> 00:05:34.160
Christensen family

142
00:05:31.7 --> 00:05:36.830
when a lego group which makes toy

143
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:40.280
plastic building blocks expects to

144
00:05:36.83 --> 00:05:43.070
report a loss in 1998 its first since

145
00:05:40.28 --> 00:05:44.420
the 1930s during these years the CEO is

146
00:05:43.07 --> 00:05:46.940
the founders godson can charge

147
00:05:44.42 --> 00:05:48.470
Christiansen he was 57 years old and he

148
00:05:46.94 --> 00:05:50.720
had been leading the company for nine

149
00:05:48.47 --> 00:05:52.460
years he saw how day after day his

150
00:05:50.72 --> 00:05:54.560
family business was going towards

151
00:05:52.46 --> 00:05:56.810
bankruptcy and in that moment he took

152
00:05:54.56 --> 00:05:59.210
one of the bravest and wisest decisions

153
00:05:56.81 --> 00:06:02.560
a man can take he stepped aside and let

154
00:05:59.21 --> 00:06:02.560
someone younger take charge

155
00:06:04.26 --> 00:06:09.060
jörgen cannons drop was just 36 when he

156
00:06:07.05 --> 00:06:11.010
took Legos wheel not only that he was

157
00:06:09.06 --> 00:06:13.140
the first CEO that came from outside of

158
00:06:11.01 --> 00:06:14.550
the Christensen family nonetheless this

159
00:06:13.14 --> 00:06:16.260
transition he was a friendly one

160
00:06:14.55 --> 00:06:19.490
both former in the new CEO worked

161
00:06:16.26 --> 00:06:19.490
alongside each other for years

162
00:06:22.6 --> 00:06:26.860
Kajal would advise and jorgen would

163
00:06:25.09 --> 00:06:29.170
decide and this new strategy it was

164
00:06:26.86 --> 00:06:31.510
based on two pillars specialization of

165
00:06:29.17 --> 00:06:33.040
marketing on the one hand leggo got rid

166
00:06:31.51 --> 00:06:35.110
of everything that didn't contribute to

167
00:06:33.04 --> 00:06:37.690
what they did best manufacturing plastic

168
00:06:35.11 --> 00:06:40.150
blocks the rest was totally expendable

169
00:06:37.69 --> 00:06:42.520
they went from 7,000 workers to a little

170
00:06:40.15 --> 00:06:44.260
more than 3000 and jorgen completely

171
00:06:42.52 --> 00:06:46.120
restructured the company up until then

172
00:06:44.26 --> 00:06:48.100
the lego video games were created by a

173
00:06:46.12 --> 00:06:49.990
subsidiary called lego interactive

174
00:06:48.1 --> 00:06:51.790
jörgen sold their firm and started

175
00:06:49.99 --> 00:06:54.190
charging royalties to anyone who wanted

176
00:06:51.79 --> 00:06:55.660
to produce lego inspired video games and

177
00:06:54.19 --> 00:07:01.560
the same it happened in other areas of

178
00:06:55.66 --> 00:07:04.240
business troubled Lego sells theme parks

179
00:07:01.56 --> 00:07:05.980
the other pillar was marketing jörgen

180
00:07:04.24 --> 00:07:07.810
realized that his plastic blocks were

181
00:07:05.98 --> 00:07:09.940
wonderful but they didn't really meet

182
00:07:07.81 --> 00:07:11.650
customers needs of course teachers and

183
00:07:09.94 --> 00:07:13.570
experts agreed that Lego was a really

184
00:07:11.65 --> 00:07:17.250
educational toy it poor kids to be

185
00:07:13.57 --> 00:07:17.250
creative and systematic

186
00:07:18.0 --> 00:07:24.389
even rival companies recognize that Lego

187
00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.389
blocks were of a higher quality

188
00:07:25.06 --> 00:07:29.300
but who cares about the opinion of a

189
00:07:27.47 --> 00:07:30.620
pedagogue or a rival company you see

190
00:07:29.3 --> 00:07:32.870
when you have a toy manufacturing

191
00:07:30.62 --> 00:07:34.669
company your consumers are the children

192
00:07:32.87 --> 00:07:36.440
so maybe you remember how it was when

193
00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:41.539
you were a child what did you do when

194
00:07:36.44 --> 00:07:43.550
you played with toys we probably made up

195
00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.860
stories of course when it comes to the

196
00:07:43.55 --> 00:07:47.690
Lego blocks making stories it isn't the

197
00:07:45.86 --> 00:07:49.250
first step first you have to put all the

198
00:07:47.69 --> 00:07:51.139
pieces together so you can have the

199
00:07:49.25 --> 00:07:53.090
helicopter you can have the police car

200
00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:54.320
you can have the police station but once

201
00:07:53.09 --> 00:07:56.180
you have that you just want to play you

202
00:07:54.32 --> 00:07:57.889
want to make your own movie but the hero

203
00:07:56.18 --> 00:08:03.530
against the bad guy all of that good

204
00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:05.930
stuff and this is how Lego realized that

205
00:08:03.53 --> 00:08:08.030
children needed characters scenarios and

206
00:08:05.93 --> 00:08:13.729
stories you see the old Lego products

207
00:08:08.03 --> 00:08:16.490
there was something like this so yeah a

208
00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:18.380
steam train a pirate ship a castle a

209
00:08:16.49 --> 00:08:21.560
city not exactly if the most thrilling

210
00:08:18.38 --> 00:08:27.860
things ever but after 2000 Lego products

211
00:08:21.56 --> 00:08:30.080
went to the next level here we can see

212
00:08:27.86 --> 00:08:33.740
an underwater city about to be destroyed

213
00:08:30.08 --> 00:08:35.630
by a giant octopus so now here is the

214
00:08:33.74 --> 00:08:38.570
big question which do you think is more

215
00:08:35.63 --> 00:08:41.000
exciting a steam train or a giant cyber

216
00:08:38.57 --> 00:08:43.520
octopus well with this principle is how

217
00:08:41.0 --> 00:08:46.250
a new series was born from the Atlantis

218
00:08:43.52 --> 00:08:48.140
series to the now legendary Bionicle all

219
00:08:46.25 --> 00:08:50.270
of a sudden Lego stopped selling plastic

220
00:08:48.14 --> 00:08:57.020
building blocks and started selling

221
00:08:50.27 --> 00:08:59.630
stories story is good enough and context

222
00:08:57.02 --> 00:09:02.000
enough to inspire toys but also even

223
00:08:59.63 --> 00:09:04.430
video games and even movies the new

224
00:09:02.0 --> 00:09:06.830
product strategy was based on three key

225
00:09:04.43 --> 00:09:09.529
questions what your game called the

226
00:09:06.83 --> 00:09:11.570
three moments of truth in a game one

227
00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:14.959
when it's advertised does it make a

228
00:09:11.57 --> 00:09:17.329
child say I want this to once he opens

229
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:19.690
the box does it make him go I want more

230
00:09:17.329 --> 00:09:19.690
of this

231
00:09:21.15 --> 00:09:25.660
three one month later

232
00:09:23.44 --> 00:09:27.550
does he come back to the toy rebuild it

233
00:09:25.66 --> 00:09:29.050
and still play with it or does he put it

234
00:09:27.55 --> 00:09:31.060
on the shelf and forget about it but not

235
00:09:29.05 --> 00:09:32.530
only that if kids like stories why not

236
00:09:31.06 --> 00:09:34.300
make toys about their favorite movies

237
00:09:32.53 --> 00:09:36.070
this is how Lego partnered with Lucas

238
00:09:34.3 --> 00:09:40.990
Films to launch a collection based on

239
00:09:36.07 --> 00:09:42.700
Star Wars and of course the same went

240
00:09:40.99 --> 00:09:45.160
for Batman Lord of the Rings and even

241
00:09:42.7 --> 00:09:47.560
Harry Potter virtually there is no movie

242
00:09:45.16 --> 00:09:49.990
the kids enjoy that has no lego licensed

243
00:09:47.56 --> 00:09:55.240
product and you can believe me these

244
00:09:49.99 --> 00:09:57.430
things are utter blockbusters while

245
00:09:55.24 --> 00:10:00.220
there are hundreds of different makers

246
00:09:57.43 --> 00:10:02.080
of action figures and dolls whose

247
00:10:00.22 --> 00:10:05.410
corporate logos children are

248
00:10:02.08 --> 00:10:08.920
increasingly indifferent to lego boasts

249
00:10:05.41 --> 00:10:10.960
an estimated 85% share of the building

250
00:10:08.92 --> 00:10:12.790
block market so do you remember when I

251
00:10:10.96 --> 00:10:14.350
said that Lego had sold all its

252
00:10:12.79 --> 00:10:16.240
subsidiary companies that didn't relate

253
00:10:14.35 --> 00:10:18.010
to manufacturing of plastic pieces well

254
00:10:16.24 --> 00:10:19.960
that was true but now they make a

255
00:10:18.01 --> 00:10:21.880
fortune with the royalties they charge

256
00:10:19.96 --> 00:10:24.400
to all of those who made videogames and

257
00:10:21.88 --> 00:10:27.130
movies about Lego and believe me this

258
00:10:24.4 --> 00:10:29.940
has become an absolute money-making

259
00:10:27.13 --> 00:10:29.940
machine

260
00:10:30.14 --> 00:10:36.030
the lego movie premiered last Friday and

261
00:10:33.51 --> 00:10:39.090
made 69 million dollars in its opening

262
00:10:36.03 --> 00:10:45.150
weekend making it the largest debut of

263
00:10:39.09 --> 00:10:46.980
the year so far all of this explains why

264
00:10:45.15 --> 00:10:48.660
while other toy companies are struggling

265
00:10:46.98 --> 00:10:51.270
to win the battle against video games

266
00:10:48.66 --> 00:10:57.120
Lego is making record sales in all

267
00:10:51.27 --> 00:11:00.390
markets including the USA but the big

268
00:10:57.12 --> 00:11:03.360
opportunity here is Asia this is a brand

269
00:11:00.39 --> 00:11:05.490
new untapped market ready to be opened

270
00:11:03.36 --> 00:11:07.560
companies like Mattel or Hasbro are

271
00:11:05.49 --> 00:11:11.120
already compensating for their losses in

272
00:11:07.56 --> 00:11:11.120
America and Europe with sales in China

273
00:11:12.83 --> 00:11:17.750
but for Lego this is a whole new

274
00:11:15.77 --> 00:11:20.510
challenge this is why they're making

275
00:11:17.75 --> 00:11:22.400
changes at the company again we are

276
00:11:20.51 --> 00:11:24.320
talking about a big challenge here in

277
00:11:22.4 --> 00:11:26.330
the last 15 years Lego has multiplied

278
00:11:24.32 --> 00:11:29.660
their sales by 5 and they went from

279
00:11:26.33 --> 00:11:31.520
having 3,000 workers to more than 19,000

280
00:11:29.66 --> 00:11:33.170
nonetheless you know from this video

281
00:11:31.52 --> 00:11:35.630
that Christensen's philosophy is not

282
00:11:33.17 --> 00:11:37.460
about taking many risks but in the last

283
00:11:35.63 --> 00:11:39.140
two years sales have declined a little

284
00:11:37.46 --> 00:11:41.030
this and now they want to conquer China

285
00:11:39.14 --> 00:11:42.260
and they want to have their accounting

286
00:11:41.03 --> 00:11:46.330
books healthier than ever

287
00:11:42.26 --> 00:11:46.330
and this explains policies like this one

288
00:11:46.84 --> 00:11:53.270
Lego predicts growth in its China

289
00:11:49.7 --> 00:11:55.990
business but sheds 1,400 jobs after a

290
00:11:53.27 --> 00:11:55.990
sales slump

291
00:11:56.85 --> 00:12:00.329
so now that you know the story of Lego

292
00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:01.829
the question really becomes do you think

293
00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:03.600
that Lego can conquer the Chinese

294
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:05.189
markets or do you think they're going to

295
00:12:03.6 --> 00:12:07.049
lose the battle there against video

296
00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:08.369
games well please leave your answer in

297
00:12:07.049 --> 00:12:15.720
