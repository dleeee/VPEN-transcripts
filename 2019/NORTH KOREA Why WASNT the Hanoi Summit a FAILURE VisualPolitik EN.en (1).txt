said yes to mr. trunk I regret all the

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,640
help and support

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,460
I gave him along the way I am ashamed of

35
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,729
my own failings February the 27th 2019

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,830
Michael Cohen Donald Trump's lawyer and

37
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,509
trusted sidekick for the last decade

38
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,909
appeared before the US Congress his

39
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,159
statement was a bombshell against the

40
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,840
president's Kevin accused Trump of

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,670
cooperating with Russia during the

42
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,860
election campaign as well as several tax

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,079
crimes he also described to Donald Trump

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,990
as a racist a con man and a cheat I am

45
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,390
ashamed because I know what mr. Trump is

46
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,720
he is a racist he is a con man and he is

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,460
achieved you know a little impressed by

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,960
that frankly could have he could have

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,270
gone all out he only went about 95

50
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,940
percent instead of a hundred percent

51
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,890
so Devo ah Michael Kern was talking

52
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,510
about Donald Trump the president of the

53
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,550
United States himself was thousands of

54
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,230
kilometers away from Washington on a

55
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,300
trip in her Nonie the Vietnamese capital

56
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,580
to meet with the North Korean leader Kim

57
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,820
jong-un in what was the second summit

58
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,649
between the two leaders but I think

59
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,400
having a fake hearing like that and

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,620
having it in the middle of this very

61
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,560
important summit is really a terrible

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,120
thing this is a summit that has been

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,950
dismissed by most of the media as a

64
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,690
failure and this leaves us with a big

65
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,910
question well was the Hanoi summit

66
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,950
really a failure where exactly did the

67
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,690
negotiations between the United States

68
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,000
and North Korea ends up well let's take

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,640
a look

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,140
[Applause]

71
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,410
[Music]

72
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,940
alright so there are some exceptions but

73
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,700
generally sequels never as exciting as

74
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,550
the original right control well it looks

75
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,940
like something similar happens in Hanoi

76
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,030
[Music]

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,800
just eight months after the historic

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,630
first meeting in Singapore donald trump

79
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,340
and kim jeong-hoon they saw each other

80
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,500
again expectations at this time a

81
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,540
concrete agreement would be reached with

82
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,230
deadlines goals and objectives however

83
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,650
antonyms happen the summit ended hastily

84
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,570
without any specific understanding on

85
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,250
the one hand North Korea demanded that

86
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,690
all international sanctions be

87
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,400
eliminated in exchange for dismantling

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,070
its main nuclear complex not the only

89
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,410
one it has the young beyond complex safe

90
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,090
center dedicated to the production of

91
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,550
plutonium and uranium fuel for North

92
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,480
Korea's nuclear weapons on the one hands

93
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,100
the United States demanded that North

94
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,140
Korea take the first step dismantling

95
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,880
all of its nuclear programs production

96
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,590
and development centers including all

97
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,870
the clandestine centers after this they

98
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,250
would contemplate lifting the

99
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,220
international sanctions

100
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,000
[Music]

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,280
as you can see their positions weren't

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,080
entirely compatible North Korea didn't

103
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,700
want to give up its nuclear program in

104
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,290
the United States wasn't willing to make

105
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,530
concessions at all the dilemma that we

106
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,300
were confronted with is the North

107
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,310
Koreans at this point are unwilling to

108
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,380
impose a complete freeze on their

109
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,260
weapons of mass destruction programs so

110
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,450
to give many many billions of dollars in

111
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,610
sanctions relief would in effect put us

112
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,190
in a position of subsidizing the ongoing

113
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,570
development of weapons of mass

114
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,910
destruction in North Korea a State

115
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,440
Department officials speaking to The

116
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,510
Washington Post but don't think this

117
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,910
came as a surprise it's true Donald

118
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,710
Trump did seem very upbeat thinking that

119
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,630
in exchange for guaranteeing a splendid

120
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,520
future for North Korea with investments

121
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,650
and economic developments it managed to

122
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,020
convince Kim jong-un to change his ways

123
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,780
I'll check this out our United States

124
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,640
team has arrived in North Korea to make

125
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,650
arrangements for the summit between Kim

126
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,770
jong-un and myself I truly believe North

127
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,320
Korea as brilliant potential it'll be a

128
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,840
great economic and financial nation one

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,970
day Kim jong-un agrees with me on this

130
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,700
it will happen Donald Trump but the

131
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,130
truth is that his team was much less

132
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,860
optimistic North Korea will seek to

133
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,100
retain its WMD capabilities and is

134
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,350
unlikely to completely give up its

135
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,940
nuclear weapons and production

136
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,190
capabilities because its leaders

137
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,830
ultimately view nuclear weapons as

138
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,940
critical to regime survival

139
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,400
both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and

140
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
national security adviser john bolton

141
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,030
have expressed their doubts about being

142
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,300
able to reach an agreement

143
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,430
the fact is that this is what every

144
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,260
media source has been told and is the

145
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,150
reason why the summit was considered a

146
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,710
true failure but hold on a second

147
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,700
because the question we want to answer

148
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,920
is well was it really a failure well

149
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,930
yeah it kind of was but also know

150
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,800
[Applause]

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,410
if you'e let's be upfront about this on

152
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,639
visual politic we don't exactly

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,800
sympathize with Donald Trump but we

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,319
always want to be objective which is not

155
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,020
the same as being neutral so we believe

156
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,789
that we can give you three reasons why

157
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,409
the summit's unlike what most of the

158
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:03,629
media have said wasn't an absolute

159
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:14,720
failure so listen up objective Vietnam

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,159
although it often goes unnoticed with

161
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,500
more than 90 million inhabitants Vietnam

162
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,360
has not only become one of the fastest

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,069
growing economies in the world in the

164
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,259
last three decades but it's also become

165
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,539
increasingly important to the United

166
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,020
States yes it may be surprising but

167
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,639
these two countries that less than half

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
a century ago worth protagonists of one

169
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
of the longest and harshest wars in

170
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,110
history and out to significant economic

171
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,920
and political partners

172
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,879
[Music]

173
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,529
you're more proof of this tight

174
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:52,809
relationship in March of 2018 the

175
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:55,209
aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson set

176
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:57,639
sail for four days in Danang it was the

177
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,589
first visit to Vietnam by a US military

178
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,089
ship since the end of the war in 1975

179
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,379
the point is that Donald Trump's visit

180
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:07,539
it didn't have only one goal but rather

181
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:12,309
to allow me to explain the White House

182
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:13,629
took advantage of this trip to

183
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,580
strengthen its ties with the Vietnamese

184
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,589
government Trump met both the presidents

185
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,360
and the Prime Minister and presided over

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,949
a symbolic act in which several

187
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,749
Vietnamese airlines commissioned more

188
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,639

addition they mapped out free trade

192
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,080
agreements and the sale of billions of

193
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,749
dollars of military equipments that's

194
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,639
because the United States wants to turn

195
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,499
Vietnam into one of its most important

196
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,719
partners in this area of the world both

197
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,899
politically and economically why well

198
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,639
because Vietnam is growing by leaps and

00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,979
further it's very open to trade it's got

201
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,899
unfriendly relations with China and its

202
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,449
workforce has very low labor costs in

203
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,369
other words it's a perfect country to

204
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,469
flood with dollars although I'm not sure

205
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:00,610
how chumps are going to cope with the

206
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,289
fact that the United States has a trade

207
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,360

208
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:14,050
billion dollars for its part Vietnam

209
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,669
aims to receive all of those dollars to

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,630
relationship with Washington and would

215
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,920
like to free-trade agreement with the

entirely dependent on Chinese markets

they also use its strength and Thai as

well that's even better

probably come as no surprise when I say

243
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,290
that the North Korean regime is a cruel

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,180
dictatorship with an absolutely

245
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,250

about a country where citizens can be

can lead to brutal re-education and

forced labor camps it's a country with a

257
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,020
state that exploits its own people by

giving up its power or its nuclear

286
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,399
forcing North Korea to acknowledge the

287
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,410
stance publicly actually strengthens the

United States for any future

289
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,640

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,740
subsequent agreements have drops and

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,690
that was needed actually it was a very

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,910
productive two days but sometimes you

293
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,890
have to walk washington has gained the

294
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,019
upper hand in the negotiations which

295
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,760
they will continue to flex because they

296
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,589
know North Korea desperately needs to

297
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:23,450
overcome its sanctions now this all

298
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,690

reforms folks just thirty years ago

302
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,159
Vietnam was in an even worse situation

303
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,899
than North Korea the country was

304
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,149
shattered by Wars and suffering from a

305
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,249
blockade from China the United States

306
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,470
Europe and even its Southeast Asian

307
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,639
neighbors his economy

308
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,129
it was literally sunk leaving about 70

percent of its inhabitants to live in

310
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,319
extreme poverty since then things

311
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,530

that's an SIV reduction 70 percent to 3

317
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,400
percent well the fact is that Vietnam

318
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
unilaterally implemented its own reform

319
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,450
plan known as the DOE Moy they started

320
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,190
doing this even before they reconciled

321
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,080
with the international community that is

322
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,430
they were doing this while they were

323
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,290
suffering a blockade from the United

324
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,580

325
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,990
example for North Korea

326
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,820
what better action to involve Vietnam in

327
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,530
this process and set it up as an example

328
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,720
it's a great way to let Pyongyang know

329
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,270
what they could achieve the success of

330
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,430
the Vietnamese economy is due to its

331
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,440
decision to normalize relations with the

332
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,140
United States in 1995 I would say to our

333
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,120
North Korean friends as long as they

334
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,320
have a conflict with the United States

335
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,600
they will not be able to develop their

in several videos which will link to in

342
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,100
the description that Kim Jong young

343
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,110
seems determined to promote economic

344
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,630
reforms and open North Korea what better

345
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,340
way to persuade him than by showing him

346

improvement of the economy and people's

349

350
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,970

351
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,680
Korean problem will only be solved with

352
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,780
a new strategy that focuses more on

353
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,270
trade than on weapons maybe the summit

354
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,370
didn't have the expected results but

355
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,140
does that mean it was a failure the

356
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,030
answer is not so clear at first glance

357
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,680
especially if we consider the White

358
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,220
House's new strategy we are not going to

359
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,860
invade North Korea we are not seeking to

360
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,750
topple the North Korean regime we are

361
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,970
ready for a different future it's bigger

362
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,550
than denuclearization I'm absolutely

363
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,500
convinced and more importantly the

364
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,360
president of the United States is

365
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,580
convinced that it's time to move past 70

366
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,010
years of war and hostility on the Korean

367
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,200

368
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,780

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,110
you support the Trump administration's
