[Music]

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:09,360
as Abidjan is their country that you

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,920
didn't know existed until you watch that

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,719
James Bond movie the world is not enough

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,849
nonetheless this country has a lot to

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,590
offer yes we're talking again about

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,770
natural gas but believe me there is way

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,740
more going on here Vito Corleone used to

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,289
say family is an important matter and

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,240
they know this quite well known as Abba

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,630
Shawn

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,820
in fact the le family means everything

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,140
in that country

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,600
[Music]

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,610
they control the country's politics and

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,930
its economics with an iron fist

18
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,430
nonetheless when it comes to negotiating

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,950
they aren't so much into horse heads in

20
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,860
beds but rather caviar yep you heard

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,510
that right the alia family can be

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,370
corrupt and repressive with their own

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,500
citizens but they know how to treat

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,989
foreigners like rock stars five-star

25
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,900
hotels caviar and all kinds of luxuries

26
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,640
although if you're an EU official

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,320
watching this video and you're planning

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,300
on paying a visit to the I have family

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,309
well watch your step because despite how

30
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,470
it looks baku azerbaijan scabbit all is

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,110
not like las vegas indeed what happens

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,280
here will stay on a videotape forever

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,580
[Music]

34
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,630
anyway jay-z on foreigners too much

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,520
azerbaijan has managed to become a

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,020
member of the Council of Europe to

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,160
participate in the Eurovision Song

38
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,440
Contest and to even play soccer in the

39
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,539
European Cup all of this despite the

40
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,490
fact that they share a border with Iran

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,119
yes Azerbaijan is far from Europe but

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,729
their Europe's best friend and now you

43
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,950
might wonder why is this country so

44
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,369
attractive well it's not just the caviar

45
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,380
in fact the Caspian Sea has many other

46
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,060
interesting things they have enormous

47
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,430
oil reserves and also enormous gas

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,049
reserves and remember who needs to

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,479
diversify their gas supplies badly well

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,579
of course that's the European Union if

51
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,900
you've watched the previous videos in

52
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,790
this series about Russian gas you know

53
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,950
that Europe relies heavily on Russia

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,380
this is why corrupted and authoritarian

55
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,869
as they are in Azerbaijan Brussels needs

56
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,630
to do business with them

57
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,560
so now I can probably guess where you're

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,080
thinking Putin is not going to be happy

59
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,510
with this right at the end of the day

60
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,970
Russia wants Europe to depends on their

61
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,920
gas so anytime they look for other

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,020
providers that's bad news for the

63
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,360
Kremlin but actually the reality is the

64
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,950
opposite Stream as we said the Ali

65
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,110
family has turned diplomacy into an art

66
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,150
form and they know how to prefer and

67
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,730
everyone including Putin so the question

68
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,000
now becomes why is Baku so important to

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,720
Moscow

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,090
how can Azerbaijan be Europe and Putin's

71
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,580
friends at the same time and well what

72
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,290
does Ukraine have to do with any of this

73
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,300
well today we're going to answer all of

74
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,580
these questions but before we do let's

75
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,000
take a look back at the history

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,110
[Music]

77
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,110
happy our diplomacy may 2014 the

78
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,710
Uruguayan

79
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,540
soccer player Diego godÃ­n scores the

80
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,850
goal that allows Athletico madrid to win

81
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,680
the european soccer league now if you're

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,790
American this probably doesn't mean very

83
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,620
much to you but outside of America

84
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,210
soccer is a bit of a big deal so

85
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,340
millions of viewers from all over the

86
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,860
world were watching soccer on TV with a

87
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,440
t-shirt that reads Azerbaijan land of

88
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
fire

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,390
this was the case between the years of

90
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,270
2012 to 2015 so now you might be

91
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,770
wondering well why did Azerbaijan spend

92
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,470
24 million euros to sponsor a soccer

93
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,870
team in Spain maybe they were trying to

94
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,610
promote tourism but have you ever heard

95
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,750
anyone say oh yes I'm going to

96
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,640
Azerbaijan this holiday season it's

97
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,660
going to be lovely

98
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,600
no me neither the answer it has nothing

99
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,700
to do with tourism in 2009 as you might

100
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,140
know Europeans spent several days

101
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,180
without gas because there were gas wars

102
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,160
between Russia and Ukraine that was the

103
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,360
moment when the European Union it

104
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,370
started looking for alternative gas

105
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,470
suppliers at the same time Azerbaijan

106
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,830
was enjoying a gas boom

107
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,910
[Music]

108
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,790
in 2006 the Shah Deniz gas-filled began

109
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,850
production and this was a big gas-filled

110
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,740
it was so big that it could help Europe

111
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,350
reduce their Russian dependency by 10%

112
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,090
in other words Europe was desperately

113
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,740
looking for suppliers and Azerbaijan was

114
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,290
desperately looking for buyers love was

115
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,410
in the air but as you know love it needs

116
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,930
a spark it is a little passion this is

117
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,150
where these so called caviar diplomacy

118
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,370
it comes in you see nobody likes to do

119
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,290
business with a dictatorship butts in

120
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,230
Baku they have money to buy just about

121
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,760
everything now normally no one's willing

122
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,380
to sponsor the European games because

123
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,880
they're kind of like the Olympics but

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,500
they're a lot smaller and they make no

125
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,360
financial sense but this wasn't a

126
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,070
problem because Azerbaijan was happy to

127
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,140
pay with their oil money Valencia or a

128
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,820
Spanish city no longer possible to host

129
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,860
the Formula one there no problem as by

130
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,390
John pays with their oil money maybe

131
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,070
needs sponsors for the European Cup

132
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,900
again no problem

133
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,250
Azerbaijan score that oil money and

134
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,780
they're gonna pick up the bill no matter

135
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,460
if we're talking about the brand

136
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,520
Azerbaijan land of fire or so car which

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,540
is Azerbaijan's

138
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,660
oil company the Ali family money is

139
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,910
everywhere and this explains news like

140
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:16,360
this road 2020 get ready for games from

141
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Bilbao to Baku and more minnows yes you

142
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,500
heard that right the next year a cup

143
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,510
will be played in 11 countries and that

144
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,700
includes Azerbaijan despite not being

145
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,340
European and not really having a strong

146
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,050
tradition of soccer with these kinds of

147
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,760
events sands Bojan has a great chance to

148
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,260
improve their image and buy political

149
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,980
goodwill

150
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,230
thanks to this nobody has any problem

151
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,270
with building all of the pipelines they

152
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,070
want this is how we have these self

153
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,690
Caucus's pipeline which connects the

154
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,730
Caspian Sea with Turkey and crosses

155
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,170
Georgia this one has been in operation

156
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,050
since 2006 and looks like this

157
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,720
[Music]

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,979
yes yes I know the pup kind of looks

159
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,780
weird on that right it looks like they

160
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,400
were drunk when they were designing it

161
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,410
the reason why it's not a straight line

162
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,180
is because Azerbaijan doesn't want to

163
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,830
cross Armenia the relationship between

164
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,930
Armenia and Azerbaijan is even worse

165
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,550
than the relationship between Russia and

166
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,760
Ukraine this is why they're rather cross

167
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,820
Georgia this is why Russia who is more

168
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,669
Pro Armenian is not a good friend of the

169
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,770
Ali family but that's something we're

170
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,180
going to talk about later after this

171
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,310
pipeline came the tan app which goes all

172
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,020
the way down to Greece the tan app

173
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,570
started operation this year 2018 and the

174
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,340
final project is the so called tap which

175
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,169
is expected to go all the way to Italy

176
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,360
now the big question is what does Putin

177
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,250
think about all of this well in the

178
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,780
beginning he was far from happy

179
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,120
in fact he tried to stop a zero gas from

180
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,389
arriving in Italy at any cost how did he

181
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:43,340
do this well essentially he calls up his

182
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,990
Italian friends remember from previous

183
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,850
video hugger Haj Schrader is Putin's man

184
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,160
in Berlin well in Rome he's got that

185
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,350
they greenio the leader of the five

186
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,060
stars movements which is a populist

187
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,490

[Music]

189
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,470
watch out for connections between Russia

190
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,570
and the five stars movement and this is

191
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,340
why bet the griller used to say things

192
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,020
like this we wanna make this pipe in

193
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,420
Puglia rather than any other place we

194
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,910
will drink the army if necessary

195
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,770
let's pause that right there this

196
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,410
declaration is from 2014 but we're

197
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,720
making this video in 2018

198
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,400
four years is a really long time so

199
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,980
let's fast forward and see what happens

200
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,060
[Music]

201
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,400
everything remains at home every dynasty

202
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,830
has a godfather and this is the story of

203
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,290
Heydar I leave he started his career as

204
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,960
a KGB spy for 25 years he was sort of

205
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,450
the James Bond of Baku then in 1969

206
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,790
Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev

207
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,350
named him the leader of the Soviet

208
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,420
republic of azerbaijan his political

209
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,120
career its sword in silver 1980s when he

210
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,860
had problems with later general

211
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,129
secretary mikhail gorbachev

212
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,439
then in 1991 Azerbaijan gained

213
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,509
independence in two years Haider Ali EV

214
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:04,520
became the president's with pay

215
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,580
attention here 98 point eight percent of

216
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,519
the vote yes this is the Azerbaijan

217
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,830
style of democracy nonetheless Heydar he

218
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,569
was a man of compromise he used to be a

219
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,819
good communist but he easily adapted to

220
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,769
the capitalistic framework in less than

221
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,719
a year he signs the so-called contract

222
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:27,769
of the century BP Exxon Chevron and the

223
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,149
Norwegian Statoil

224
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,919
they all wanted to have their share of

225
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,500
Azerbaijan's gas and oil and they leave

226
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,789
he was happy to give it to them in

227
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,889
exchange for a juicy 80 percent of the

228
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:38,509
profits in fact remember that James Bond

229
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:39,740
movie I mentioned earlier the world is

230
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,300
not enough well that movie opens with a

231
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,099
scene where Pierce Brosnan is driving a

232
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,199
car through oil rigs in their country

233
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,029
and as a sight it by the way James Bond

234
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,829
is an amazing geopolitical compass

235
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,540
anytime they choose a location for

236
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,339
shooting it's because that country is

237
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,860
very interested in appearing in a movie

238
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,990
and if they're interested it's usually

239
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,519
for a reason alright so let's get back

240
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,380
to today's movie as a bojong's economy

241
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,720
skyrocketed their oil their gas and

242
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
their caviar the country grew and so did

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,139
its corruption everything remains in the

244
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,600
family business and as Vito Corleone

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,790
used to say a man who doesn't spend time

246
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,490
with his family can never be a real man

247
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,110
so upon the death of the Godfather

248
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,810
Heydar Aliev in 2003 his son

249
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,800
Ilhan inherited the business

250
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,779
this time he won the elections with 75%

251
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,880
of the votes and yes as you know by now

252
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,920
Azerbaijan style of democracy is rather

253
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,930
amusing if you don't believe me just

254
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:42,570
look at this news Azerbaijan released

255
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,790
election results before voting and even

256
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,769
started in fact Ilhan a leave doesn't

257
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,870
even waste time pretending not to be

258
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,440
corrupt

259
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,060
he changed the Constitution so that he

260
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,800
can run for elections as many times as

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,269
what's a vice president the country

262
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,339
that's also his wife by the way

263
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,630
and he also changed the law that

264
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,519
specified the age required to run for

265
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,230
elections before you had to be older

266
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,180
than 35 to run for president but this

267
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,000
time is only 21 you never know and of

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
course anybody who speaks against the

269
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,930
Ali family may end up in jail meanwhile

270
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,820
they're getting richer and richer every

271
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,360
year

272
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,010
remember the Panama papers well one of

273
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,389
the biggest clients of mossack fonseca

274
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,149
was the leaves so well what do you when

275
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,220
you have as much money as you want well

276
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,449
you use it to make friends Russian

277
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:26,480
inquiry at Council of Europe over

278
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,860
Azerbaijan alright so we Slevin are the

279
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,000
big question though how did they manage

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,699
to befriend Putin well we're gonna tell

281
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,990
you right now

282
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,050
[Music]

283
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,940
realpolitik michael corleone used to say

284
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,230
keep your friends close but your enemies

285
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,360
closer if you remember blood amir putin

286
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,650
has two goals on his agenda

287
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,340
[Music]

288
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,320
one is to sell gas to Europe and the

289
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,510
other is to bypass Ukraine on the gas

290
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,700
transit after the gas Wars the Nord

291
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,380
Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 were built

292
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,970
these pipelines connect to directly

293
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,560
Russia and Germany through the Baltic

294
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,840
Sea but this isn't enough if they want

295
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,730
to isolate Ukraine forever they need

296
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,400
more pipes in the south and that is

297
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,290
harder than it looks look what happens

298
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,420
when they tried the first time Korea

299
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,940
suspends South Stream gas pipeline

300
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,540
project

301
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,610
unlike Azerbaijan Putin isn't so

302
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,500
brilliant when it comes to diplomacy the

303
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,570
Crimea invasion cost him a lot of

304
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,460
economic sanctions and made Europe stop

305
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,110
the pipeline that the Kremlin wanted to

306
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,270
build so Putin he had to look for a

307
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,520
better strategy and with this in mind

308
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,650
the Azerbaijan pipe it didn't look so

309
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,120
bad anymore you say if Europe is

310
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,980
investing in having a pipe in the south

311
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,380
to get gas from Azerbaijan Russia can

312
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,570
also sends their gas through it and this

313
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,910
this is how the Turks dream was born

314
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,890
Turks dream is another pipe that goes

315
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,110
from Russia to Turkey but once it gets

316
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,570
to Turkey you can also connect it with

317
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,880
the other pipe that goes to Italy just

318
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,080
have a look at this map

319
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,490
[Music]

320
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,950
in other words Russia's play goes as

321
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,570
follows they bring the gas to Turkey

322
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,340
from there it goes to Italy so that the

323
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,020
pipe that was originally designed to be

324
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,840
for Azerbaijan's gas will carry Russian

325
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,330
gas as well in other words the Ali

326
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,520
family is no longer a threat to Putin

327
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,380
but actually an opportunity and things

328
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,490
have changed in Russia and they've

329
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,410
changed in literally to another how that

330
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,760
five stars movement was completely

331
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,350
against the TAT pipeline well now the

332
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,480
five star movement is one of the ruling

333
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,180
parties in Italy and well guess what

334
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:32,210
they say now my own ta P is not

335
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,760
strategic but it is shielded meanwhile

336
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,110
there are two world leaders that have

337
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,950
become really good friends this looks

338
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,780
like the ending to a Hollywood movie the

339
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,000
European Union is happy because now they

340
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,710
can diversify their gas supply as

341
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,810
bhaijaan is happy to because now they're

342
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,820
going to become enormous lis rich Russia

343
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,290
is happy as well because they can bypass

344
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,760
Ukraine once and for all

345
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
yes everybody seems to be happy except

346
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,060
for Ukraine they most likely have a very

347
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,400
very dark future so now I have a

348
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,140
question for you do you think Europe

349
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,000
will let Putin achieve his goals with

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
Ukraine do you think the Alief family

351
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,120
will keep running the country as a

352
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,100
family business what do you think will

353
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,050
happen with Ukraine please leave your

354
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,520
