mankind's history pirates have been a

source of fascination admiration or

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,189
terror but don't think for a moment that

26
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,409
they disappeared was a no longer fought

27
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,689
only on land sea and air these days they

28
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,250
are increasingly fought in cyberspace

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,720
that probably doesn't come there's any

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,460
surprise to you the country can greatly

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,200
harm another simply by attacking as

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,060
computer systems imagine everything they

34
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,590
could do lock communication and

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,390
transport systems electrical equipment

36
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,950
financial systems I mean practically

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,530
everything nowadays because everything

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,479
involves computers this is something

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,340
that practically all countries know

40
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,880
including North Korea

42
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,560
yes you heard that correctly and if you

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,390
don't believe me well let me try and

44
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,010
convince you in recent years the most

45
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,170
secretive hermetic country on the planet

46
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,120
has not only been developing an arsenal

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,990
of nuclear weapons

48
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,720
it has also mounted its very own hacking

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,450
offensive you see a 1998 Kim Jong Il

50
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,610
former North Korean leader and father of

51
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,740
the current leader Kim jong-un set up

52
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,890
what is known as unit 121 a cyber

53
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,140
warfare core that he claimed was made up

54
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,360
of thousands of people who work morning

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
noon and night getting ready to sow

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
chaos through cyber attacks against

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,450
communication networks energy grids and

58
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,190
all kinds of strategic infrastructure

59
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,720
belonging to the enemies of Pyongyang

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,610
yes it may seem a strange claim and

61
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,140
quite a paradox coming from one of the

62
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,030
most hermetic and poorest regimes in the

63
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,710
world but this country was highly

64
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,390
restricted Internet access and where the

65
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,620
government has developed its own

66
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,540
internet a kind of rough and highly

67
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,550
guarded intranet it has one of the most

68
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,440
dangerous hacker armies in all of

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,160
cyberspace for them the strongest weapon

70
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,800
is cyber in North Korea it's called the

71
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,440
secret war incentives for North Korea's

72
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,480
cyber experts are very attractive

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,880
they're rich people in Pyongyang Jiang

74
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,920
say ëwell a former student of North

75
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,570
Korea's military college for computer

76
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,400
science folks the person who declared

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,709
this to Reuters Yangtze Yul is a young

78
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,270
North Korean who before escaping to

79
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,220
South Korea used to study side-by-side

80
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,440
with people who now belong to unit 121

81
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,880
his testimony corroborates what many

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,440
experts have been arguing about for

83
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,959
years cyber warfare units are a priority

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,940
for the North Korean regime in fact

85
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,610
hyuna's 121 depends on the General

86
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,290
Directorate of acknowledgments and

87
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,450
intelligence agency the reports and

88
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,230
responds directly to Kim Jong himself

[Music]

90
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,900
and that's not all according to some

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,730
estimations these cyberattack teams are

92
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,070
composed of almost 2,000 hackers and

93
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,020
maybe costing between 10 and 20 percent

94
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,180
of the entire North Korean military

95
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,760
budget this is a pretty good indication

96
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,550
of how important they are to the country

97
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,900
it is believed that they launched their

98
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,050
first large attack in 2013 using malware

99
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,060
known as Dark Soul these hacker teams

100
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,340
managed to arrays a huge amount of data

101
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,700
and block or turn off 32,000 devices in

102
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,740
South Korea devices which included the

103
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,570
servers of four major banks and three

104
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,549
South Korean television agencies and I

105
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:23,840
promise you this is not a joke just one

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,060
year later in 2014 South Korea's nuclear

107
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,800
energy corporation announced that their

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,480
computer systems have been hacked the

109
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,950
North Korean hackers had stolen plans

110
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,870
for their nuclear reactors personal data

111
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,210
on more than 10,000 employees and other

112
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,120
undisclosed information since then the

113
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,560
attacks that North Korean hackers have

114
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,790
carried out around the globe have been

115
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,890
continuous and quite a headache for

116
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,810
several international companies and

117
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,460
governments

118
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,070
for example in 2017 the same guys

119
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,990
working under Kim jong-un service

120
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,820
launched the virus wanna cry which

121
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,530
became the largest malicious software

122
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,630
attack in history it is estimated that

123
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,090
it affected more than 300,000 devices

124
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,430
and put multinationals such as FedEx and

125
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,150
telefónica

126
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,630
on the ropes the US and UK governments

127
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,400
have said North Korea was responsible

128
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,350
for the wanna cry malware attack

129
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,570
affecting hospitals businesses and banks

130
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,730
across the world one important detail

131
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,010
these hackers don't only operate from

132
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,690
North Korea once they've been trained

133
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,400
many of these hackers are sent to China

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,440
Southeast Asia or other countries under

135
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
false identities so that they can act

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,130
from they're surprised well listen up

137
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,900
because North Korea has another cyber

138
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,970
warfare units that might amaze you even

139
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:39,449
more

140
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,199
unit 180 attack on the Treasury let's

141
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,030
face it North Korea has never exactly

142
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,830
done well in the international arena

143
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,810
however since Kim jong-un came to power

144
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,419
in 2011 accelerated the North Korean

145
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,069
nuclear program sanctions against the

146
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:57,580
country have multiplied and folks

147
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,990
developing a nuclear and ballistic

148
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,539
program it's not exactly cheap so the

149
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,979
question is if international sanctions

150
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,900
cut you off and prevent you from trading

151
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,520
with the rest of the world then the hell

152
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,960
are you gonna do to get money that you

153
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,580
need to continue buying everything you

154
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,870
need on the black markets in order to

155
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,210
complete your nuclear program any ideas

156
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,279
folks this question was on Kim Jong Un's

157
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,250
mind and in his case the answer was unit

158
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:25,330
180 in 2013 when Kim jong-un had begun

159
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,710
to feel the pressure of international

160
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,389
sanctions he decided to establish what

161
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,789
is known as Yunus 180 with 500

162
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,750
professionals from unit 121 what for

163
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,669
well I was to hack as many bank and

164
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,560
cryptocurrency accounts as possible in

165
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,330
order to obtain the resources he needed

166
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,919
to finance his nuclear and ballistic

167
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,120
program yes you heard that right in 2013

168
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,580
North Korea set up its own cyber crooks

169
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,740
unit this was a huge team dedicated to

170
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,930
stealing money to pay for the wins of

171
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,259
the dear leader unit 180 s primary job

172
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,509
is to gain foreign currency to fund

173
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:01,060
projects to develop five major weapons

174
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,639
including nuclear bombs long-range

175
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,289
missiles and submarine-launched

176
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,779
ballistic missiles Kim Hyun Kwang

177
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:09,669
a former computer science teacher at

178
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,560
North Korean University since it was

179
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,479
sent up hyuna's 180 has carried out

180
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,669
numerous acts of theft and dozens and

181
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,770
dozens of robberies all against banks

182
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,810
and cryptocurrency exchanges around the

183
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,180
world in 2016 they even stole over a

184
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,919
hundred million dollars from the Central

185
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,680
Bank of Bangladesh the North Korean

186
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,689
government's desperation for cash is

187
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,580
driving a surge in cyber attacks

188
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,830
targeting banks and other businesses in

189
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,180
the United States and around the world

190
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,940
US officials tell CNN

191
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,130
the North Koreans have quickly become

192
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,260
the world's most advanced and persistent

193
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,330
digital bank robbers it's clear that

194
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,340
global economic penalties are working

195
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,960
and have forced the North Koreans to

196
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,660
turn to alternative approaches to create

197
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,270
revenue anthony Ferrante a former FBI

198
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,550
and White House cyber security official

199
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,230
well in hacking groups depends on you to

200
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,480
180 ins therefore on the North Korean

201
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,190
government's the truth is that North

202
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,200
Korea has taken on the task of being the

203
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,180
bad guy in international politics very

204
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,890
seriously it's got nuclear weapons

205
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,720
hackers it's doing kidnappings and arms

206
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,460
trafficking is there any matter if it's

207
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,380
illegal and it's considered bad Kim

208
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:18,280
jong-un is all over it now the big

209
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,110
question is how much money have these

210
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,640
North Korean hackers actually been able

211
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,440
to steal well it's not easy to determine

212
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,390
what a panel of experts that reports to

213
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,070
the United Nations Security Council is

214
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,840
estimated that in recent years in

215
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,880
particular since 2016 pyongyang has

216
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,490
accumulated around 670 million u.s.

217
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,140
dollars in foreign currency and

218
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,820
cryptocurrency nearly 700 million

219
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,440
dollars and that's just what we know

220
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,200
about has been stolen by units 180 from

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
banks and cryptocurrency intermediaries

222
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,220
then they used blockchain to cover their

223
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,840
tracks and to transfer all of this money

224
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,850
to where they need it for example to pay

225
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,560
their technological equipment suppliers

226
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,929
on the black market

227
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,639
they see this is what indicates to us

228
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,049
that the North Korean government is

229
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,879
paying for a large part of its nuclear

230
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,739
program with cryptocurrencies which

231
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,839
obviously harder to track and don't

232
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,129
depend upon international regulations

233
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,480
but stealing is not the only activity

234
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,179
that unit 180 uses to get cash as

235
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,339
they've gained experience unit 180 also

236
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:23,869
develops software for international

237
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:26,149
companies especially in Japan and in

238
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,559
China I mean since we're already here

239
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,850
and we have all these hackers who have

240
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,410
intricate knowledge of many complex

241
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,360
cyber systems well I mean might as well

242
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,920
make the most of it right well these

243
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,199
curious orders are coordinated by some

244
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:38,299
of the pro-north groups that exist

245
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,009
around the world of course you know

246
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:41,749
hundred eighty offers rather cheap rates

247
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,670
and in many cases that contracting

248
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,379
companies don't even know they are doing

249
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,459
business with North Korean intelligence

250
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,769
and that my friends involves a very high

251
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:53,839
risk why well because it looks like

252
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,399
these software programs are often full

253
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,779
of backdoors which could eventually

254
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,920
allow the North Korean intelligence

255
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,199
service do control the devices where

256
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,970
this software is installed either to

257
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,040
block them or to continue drawing cash

258
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,910
out of them the software companies unit

259
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,919
180 has set up in countries like Vietnam

260
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,559
and Malaysia are disguised as ordinary

261
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,600
companies and they have provided factory

262
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,610
control systems and other products for

263
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,369
Japanese businesses Fumi Akiyama sake an

264
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,769
information security expert anyway folks

265
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,179
that's the story of how North Korea

266
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,889
managed to develop a powerful cyber

267
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,689
warfare division and use it to advance

268
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:30,540
their nuclear program

269
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,920
times have really changed we may no

270
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,899
longer be talking about sailing the seas

271
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,149
or pirates with eye patches but we

272
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,009
certainly are talking about piracy all

273
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,779
the same after all the internet it's

274
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,350
basically like a vast ocean now chances

275
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,699
are that your data isn't really that

276
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,470
interesting to North Korea but you know

277
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,269
every day in the press you hear about

278
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:52,120
the latest hack or data breach not hers

279
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,319
but the good news is that you can

280
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,120
protect yourself with a VPN and that's

281
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,819
where Nord VPN comes in if you have been

282
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:00,550
sitting in a cafe and on some open Wi-Fi

283
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,839
network and want to check your internet

284
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,430
banking don't think that's a good idea

285
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,370
without a VPN let's say you're a foreign

286
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,290
person living an oppressive dictatorship

287
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,240
with restrictive internet and you want

288
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,009
to watch a fun new treat video like this

289
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,750
one it's all rather met or isn't it

290
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,630
well Nord VPN will sort him out or maybe

291
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,829
more like that you just want to watch a

292
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:19,300
local content from your own country

293
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,889
abroad they also handle that too Nord

294
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,920
VPN is super fast so watching video is a

295
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,810
breeze there's no lag anything like that

296
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,730
now if you ever used VPNs before and

297
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,589
thought they were slow that is not the

298
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:34,959
case with Nord VPN and you can use it on

299
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,760
all of your devices very very easily

300
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,490
Android Chrome Windows Linux and you can

301
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,829
use it on six different devices all on

302
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:44,110
one accounts that's a lot of devices I'm

303
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,630
sure that will cover you

304
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,010
also there are no logs caps at all

305
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,800
unlike companies based in the EU or US

306
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,899
you seek nor the VPN is based in Panama

307
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,310
so they don't have to keep any logs at

308
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,930
all sort of like the opposite of North

309
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,690
Korea isn't it it's amazing for your

310
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,029
