2
00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.690
I'm gonna start off today's video by

3
00:00:08.7 --> 00:00:12.000
asking you a question

4
00:00:09.69 --> 00:00:13.889
and please don't google it oh well would

5
00:00:12.0 --> 00:00:15.809
you just read the title of this episode

6
00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.670
but it doesn't really matter anyway

7
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.800
we're betting that you didn't know that

8
00:00:17.67 --> 00:00:22.410
angola was the world's most expensive

9
00:00:19.8 --> 00:00:23.699
country and if you did well well done to

10
00:00:22.41 --> 00:00:25.109
you well when it comes to expensive

11
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.869
places to live most people think of New

12
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.750
York or Hong Kong or Zurich well that's

13
00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.600
not even close to right the world's most

14
00:00:30.75 --> 00:00:36.510
expensive city is Luann's er the capital

15
00:00:33.6 --> 00:00:40.649
city of Angola and yep that's an African

16
00:00:36.51 --> 00:00:42.660
country if you want to rent an apartment

17
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.190
in Luanda you can end up paying over

18
00:00:42.66 --> 00:00:45.750
five thousand dollars a month

19
00:00:44.19 --> 00:00:49.110
how about the cost of a Big Mac menu at

20
00:00:45.75 --> 00:00:50.579
Mackie DS well that's nineteen American

21
00:00:49.11 --> 00:00:52.320
dollars and if you want sever the

22
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.730
internet connection I mean well you'd

23
00:00:52.32 --> 00:00:55.350
better hope you've got a healthy bank

24
00:00:53.73 --> 00:00:58.020
balance because that's gonna cost you

25
00:00:55.35 --> 00:00:59.579
around three hundred dollars a month and

26
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:00.780
they were not kidding all right so now

27
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.850
you might be wondering what the hell's

28
00:01:00.78 --> 00:01:04.920
going on in Angola this is some sort of

29
00:01:02.85 --> 00:01:06.820
extremely wealthy country that no one

30
00:01:04.92 --> 00:01:09.799
knows about

31
00:01:06.82 --> 00:01:13.009
[Music]

32
00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.840
well no the Republic of Angola is one of

33
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.909
the world's biggest oil exporters

34
00:01:14.84 --> 00:01:19.159
surpassing other oil-rich countries like

35
00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.710
Qatar nevertheless half of its

36
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.710
population has no access to clean water

37
00:01:26.84 --> 00:01:31.520
two out of every three children suffer

38
00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.670
from malnutrition and one out of every

39
00:01:31.52 --> 00:01:39.679
six dies before reaching five years of

40
00:01:34.67 --> 00:01:41.509
age right on the other end of the

41
00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.819
spectrum Angola is home to one of the

42
00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.130
wealthiest women on the planet and that

43
00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.899
would be Isabel dos Santos who by the

44
00:01:46.13 --> 00:01:55.100
way is the daughter of former president

45
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:57.409
Josiah duardo dos Santos at this point

46
00:01:55.1 --> 00:01:59.149
you might be figuring out what's going

47
00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.340
on here ah yes

48
00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.159
Angola is one of the most corrupt

49
00:02:01.34 --> 00:02:05.599
countries on the planet indeed it was

50
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.000
home to one of the biggest financial

51
00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.369
Fiasco's in recent years with several

52
00:02:08.0 --> 00:02:12.319
companies losing billions of dollars in

53
00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.879
this country well perhaps this is no

54
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.890
surprise to you I mean at the end of the

55
00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:22.310
day Angola is still a third world

56
00:02:15.89 --> 00:02:25.610
country nevertheless there is a question

57
00:02:22.31 --> 00:02:27.620
that must be asked here how did they get

58
00:02:25.61 --> 00:02:30.200
here how could a country possibly have

59
00:02:27.62 --> 00:02:32.150
such a bizarre economy and more

60
00:02:30.2 --> 00:02:34.310
importantly how is it possible that the

61
00:02:32.15 --> 00:02:36.709
ruling party manages to keep control of

62
00:02:34.31 --> 00:02:38.840
this country well today are you going to

63
00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.650
answer those questions but first we do

64
00:02:38.84 --> 00:02:43.510
need to have a look at the history

65
00:02:40.65 --> 00:02:48.080
[Music]

66
00:02:43.51 --> 00:02:49.610
diamonds blood and diplomacy first thing

67
00:02:48.08 --> 00:02:51.650
we need to understand when we talk about

68
00:02:49.61 --> 00:02:53.540
Africa is that most of the African

69
00:02:51.65 --> 00:02:55.989
countries were colonies in past

70
00:02:53.54 --> 00:02:55.989
centuries

71
00:02:57.93 --> 00:03:02.760
european powerhouses like belgium france

72
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.310
and portugal invaded most of the

73
00:03:02.76 --> 00:03:07.680
continent imposing rules and treating

74
00:03:05.31 --> 00:03:10.230
the natives like animals and going up it

75
00:03:07.68 --> 00:03:12.599
was no exception until 1975 portugal

76
00:03:10.23 --> 00:03:14.700
made a fortune with its diamond mines in

77
00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.769
the country nevertheless in that same

78
00:03:14.7 --> 00:03:19.560
the portuguese government pushed by the

79
00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.260
UN and its own people recognized and

80
00:03:19.56 --> 00:03:24.000
gona's self-determination and then the

81
00:03:22.26 --> 00:03:26.489
question was what happens after a

82
00:03:24.0 --> 00:03:28.379
country stops being a colony who takes

83
00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.650
care of the governmental affairs after

84
00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.030
the European colonizers need

85
00:03:31.65 --> 00:03:36.710
[Applause]

86
00:03:34.03 --> 00:03:38.780
well instead of answering this question

87
00:03:36.71 --> 00:03:41.120
by calling for elections the many

88
00:03:38.78 --> 00:03:43.250
Angolan tribes created different fronts

89
00:03:41.12 --> 00:03:44.870
and started a civil war well that was a

90
00:03:43.25 --> 00:03:46.100
conflict that then went on to last 25

91
00:03:44.87 --> 00:03:47.780
years and there are still parts of the

92
00:03:46.1 --> 00:03:49.850
country today where you can't go because

93
00:03:47.78 --> 00:03:51.320
they're just covered in landmines in

94
00:03:49.85 --> 00:03:53.450
case you don't know what a landmine is

95
00:03:51.32 --> 00:03:55.760
it is a bomb that you bury underground

96
00:03:53.45 --> 00:03:57.860
then when someone steps on it explodes

97
00:03:55.76 --> 00:03:59.270
and well now you might be wondering how

98
00:03:57.86 --> 00:04:01.280
is it possible that such a poor country

99
00:03:59.27 --> 00:04:04.660
could afford all of those weapons and it

100
00:04:01.28 --> 00:04:04.660
was a big long civil war

101
00:04:04.82 --> 00:04:10.290
[Music]

102
00:04:07.76 --> 00:04:12.090
well the answer that one lies in the

103
00:04:10.29 --> 00:04:14.550
diamonds that we previously mentioned

104
00:04:12.09 --> 00:04:17.310
all sides of the conflict sold diamonds

105
00:04:14.55 --> 00:04:18.840
and in exchange got arms but who

106
00:04:17.31 --> 00:04:20.970
provided these arms

107
00:04:18.84 --> 00:04:23.280
well after 1976 when true Civil War

108
00:04:20.97 --> 00:04:25.050
kicked off there were two sides on the

109
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:26.820
one hand there was the unit a group who

110
00:04:25.05 --> 00:04:28.680
dominated the south of the country unit

111
00:04:26.82 --> 00:04:30.750
er was supported by South Africa China

112
00:04:28.68 --> 00:04:32.780
and to a lesser extent to the United

113
00:04:30.75 --> 00:04:32.780
States

114
00:04:33.08 --> 00:04:36.860
those were the days of the Cold War and

115
00:04:35.0 --> 00:04:39.080
every war in any part of the globe was

116
00:04:36.86 --> 00:04:41.419
seen as a good opportunity to weaken

117
00:04:39.08 --> 00:04:43.789
Soviet influence thus it was known that

118
00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.979
Angola had oil reserves this also

119
00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.840
explains why the Soviet Union wanted to

120
00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.849
take part in the conflict - they were

121
00:04:47.84 --> 00:04:51.860
supporters of the Angolan people's

122
00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.990
liberation movements or as they called

123
00:04:51.86 --> 00:04:56.360
it the MPLA but most of the war this

124
00:04:53.99 --> 00:04:58.699
leader of the MPLA was josie Eduardo dos

125
00:04:56.36 --> 00:05:00.199
Santos now dos Santos did have the

126
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.419
support of the Soviet Union but

127
00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:10.639
interestingly the country that offered

128
00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:12.710
the most support was actually Cuba and

129
00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.819
we were following our internationalist

130
00:05:12.71 --> 00:05:19.009
duty Fidel Castro he didn't stop at

131
00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.780
selling weapons did or Santos he sent

132
00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.400
over 30,000 troops to the country but

133
00:05:20.78 --> 00:05:24.020
not only that during the nineteen

134
00:05:22.4 --> 00:05:26.419
eighties the area that was under the

135
00:05:24.02 --> 00:05:28.719
MPLA control received a lot of doctors

136
00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.090
and engineers from Havana

137
00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:34.280
this explains partly why da Santos won

138
00:05:32.09 --> 00:05:36.440
the conflict in fact despite the war

139
00:05:34.28 --> 00:05:38.569
still being ongoing during the 1990s

140
00:05:36.44 --> 00:05:40.219
this man had taken control of most of

141
00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.319
the country however that Cuban helped

142
00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.800
well it wasn't as useful as you might

143
00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.110
think

144
00:05:42.8 --> 00:05:47.210
for example the agriculture experts in

145
00:05:45.11 --> 00:05:49.789
from Cuba tried to grow sugar cane on

146
00:05:47.21 --> 00:05:51.319
Angolan soil but apparently those seeds

147
00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.290
were not good for the kind of soil that

148
00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:57.270
you find in Angola

149
00:05:53.29 --> 00:05:59.280
[Music]

150
00:05:57.27 --> 00:06:01.259
and this is why within just a few years

151
00:05:59.28 --> 00:06:02.699
most of the farming lands in the country

152
00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.099
became totally infertile

153
00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.710
this meant stole vation fur angolans and

154
00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.840
an anger towards the cuban help alright

155
00:06:07.71 --> 00:06:12.000
so as if this really wasn't enough after

156
00:06:09.84 --> 00:06:13.949
the collapse of the Soviet Union Eduardo

157
00:06:12.0 --> 00:06:15.960
dos Santos realized that it's a good

158
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.560
idea to befriend the capitalist

159
00:06:15.96 --> 00:06:19.639
countries

160
00:06:16.56 --> 00:06:19.639
[Music]

161
00:06:20.22 --> 00:06:24.120
at the end of the day these were the

162
00:06:22.05 --> 00:06:26.070
countries which would buy their oil on

163
00:06:24.12 --> 00:06:27.030
the other hands America was not helping

164
00:06:26.07 --> 00:06:29.040
unit or anymore

165
00:06:27.03 --> 00:06:30.930
so what did this country need to do to

166
00:06:29.04 --> 00:06:33.150
become an ally of these so-called free

167
00:06:30.93 --> 00:06:34.560
wells well there was only one thing to

168
00:06:33.15 --> 00:06:37.080
do when that was removed the word

169
00:06:34.56 --> 00:06:40.530
Marxist from their vocabulary and swap

170
00:06:37.08 --> 00:06:42.090
it out for free market democracy and yes

171
00:06:40.53 --> 00:06:44.850
I do say that with a touch of sarcasm

172
00:06:42.09 --> 00:06:48.890
because Angolan capitalism bailed it's

173
00:06:44.85 --> 00:06:48.890
certainly one of a kind

174
00:06:51.1 --> 00:06:56.680
c'mon nursing the angolan way the year

175
00:06:54.28 --> 00:06:58.660
2002 is a turning point in Angola in

176
00:06:56.68 --> 00:07:00.700
history Eduardo dos Santos signed the

177
00:06:58.66 --> 00:07:01.930
peace agreements with his adversaries

178
00:07:00.7 --> 00:07:04.330
since then unit er has become a

179
00:07:01.93 --> 00:07:06.520
political party with a right to run for

180
00:07:04.33 --> 00:07:08.620
elections and for the first time in

181
00:07:06.52 --> 00:07:10.960
history Angolans could enjoy democracy

182
00:07:08.62 --> 00:07:16.350
but not only that in the very same year

183
00:07:10.96 --> 00:07:19.360
another meaningful thing vp makes first

184
00:07:16.35 --> 00:07:21.880
ultra-deepwater oil discovery off the

185
00:07:19.36 --> 00:07:24.280
coast of Angola suddenly Angola became

186
00:07:21.88 --> 00:07:25.900
an oil juggernaut selling tons of

187
00:07:24.28 --> 00:07:28.360
dinosaur juice to China in the United

188
00:07:25.9 --> 00:07:31.660
States in just five years and golem

189
00:07:28.36 --> 00:07:33.910
multiplied its wealth and goal as

190
00:07:31.66 --> 00:07:36.430
capital is being rebuilt the varied

191
00:07:33.91 --> 00:07:39.040
architecture from the 50s and 60s is

192
00:07:36.43 --> 00:07:40.660
giving way to new office towers that are

193
00:07:39.04 --> 00:07:42.580
being built between the national

194
00:07:40.66 --> 00:07:44.920
corporate sector and the in Golin

195
00:07:42.58 --> 00:07:47.710
government companies like ExxonMobil in

196
00:07:44.92 --> 00:07:50.320
the US or BP in the UK invested heavily

197
00:07:47.71 --> 00:07:51.970
in Angola and of course and they sent

198
00:07:50.32 --> 00:07:54.310
engineers and workers to live in the

199
00:07:51.97 --> 00:07:56.380
capital of new Anza and of course these

200
00:07:54.31 --> 00:07:58.150
people wanted good quality houses cool

201
00:07:56.38 --> 00:07:59.890
bars and these same kinds of goods that

202
00:07:58.15 --> 00:08:01.420
they could buy that kind but all of

203
00:07:59.89 --> 00:08:03.040
those things they're hard to find in a

204
00:08:01.42 --> 00:08:05.020
country their years before was having a

205
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:06.820
big old civil war in other words the

206
00:08:05.02 --> 00:08:09.130
supply was small and yet the demand

207
00:08:06.82 --> 00:08:11.910
wouldn't stop growing as a result the

208
00:08:09.13 --> 00:08:16.360
prices of Western goods went absolutely

209
00:08:11.91 --> 00:08:18.340
sky-high built for 500,000 people the

210
00:08:16.36 --> 00:08:22.180
Angolan capital is now accommodating an

211
00:08:18.34 --> 00:08:24.040
estimated five million even civil

212
00:08:22.18 --> 00:08:25.630
servants with comfortable salaries have

213
00:08:24.04 --> 00:08:27.490
trouble making ends meet

214
00:08:25.63 --> 00:08:29.260
buzz wait just a minute because there's

215
00:08:27.49 --> 00:08:30.880
more imagine we have a construction

216
00:08:29.26 --> 00:08:33.220
company in China and we want to build a

217
00:08:30.88 --> 00:08:34.750
housing Block in new anza well the first

218
00:08:33.22 --> 00:08:36.580
thing we want to do is register a

219
00:08:34.75 --> 00:08:38.710
company in Angola right well that

220
00:08:36.58 --> 00:08:40.270
process can take over six months during

221
00:08:38.71 --> 00:08:42.040
that time that's perfectly normal that

222
00:08:40.27 --> 00:08:43.960
the government finds lots of problems

223
00:08:42.04 --> 00:08:45.970
they asked me for this paver van

224
00:08:43.96 --> 00:08:48.610
registry and that other report that you

225
00:08:45.97 --> 00:08:50.350
probably don't have like the sort of

226
00:08:48.61 --> 00:08:51.970
report that a nice stack of cash and

227
00:08:50.35 --> 00:08:53.400
they do a sweaty palm under a table

228
00:08:51.97 --> 00:08:55.810
could probably fix

229
00:08:53.4 --> 00:08:58.280
[Music]

230
00:08:55.81 --> 00:09:00.200
now according to several reports made by

231
00:08:58.28 --> 00:09:02.990
organizations like transparency

232
00:09:00.2 --> 00:09:05.390
international almost every company who

233
00:09:02.99 --> 00:09:07.580
does business in angola has had to do

234
00:09:05.39 --> 00:09:08.150
some sort of bribery of a government

235
00:09:07.58 --> 00:09:10.220
official

236
00:09:08.15 --> 00:09:11.900
but wait just a minute because this is

237
00:09:10.22 --> 00:09:13.760
still not the end of it those oil

238
00:09:11.9 --> 00:09:15.170
companies like exxon mobil or british

239
00:09:13.76 --> 00:09:17.510
petroleum that were willing to do

240
00:09:15.17 --> 00:09:19.070
business in angola as they were had to

241
00:09:17.51 --> 00:09:21.170
establish partnerships with the

242
00:09:19.07 --> 00:09:23.920
government or show an angle the Angola

243
00:09:21.17 --> 00:09:23.920
state company

244
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:29.670
and now have a guess who is the head of

245
00:09:27.989 --> 00:09:31.259
that company well yes that's our friend

246
00:09:29.67 --> 00:09:33.329
we mentioned earlier Isabel dos Santos

247
00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:34.170
the daughter of the former president of

248
00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:35.939
the country

249
00:09:34.17 --> 00:09:38.459
this explains why Isabel dos Santos

250
00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:41.540
became the wealthiest women in Africa in

251
00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:41.540
so little time

252
00:09:42.47 --> 00:09:47.220
every major Angolan investment held by

253
00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:48.689
dos Santos stems either from taking a

254
00:09:47.22 --> 00:09:50.639
chunk of a company that wants to do

255
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.739
business in the country or from a stroke

256
00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.299
of the president's pen that cut her into

257
00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:55.769
the action for all of this time the

258
00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:57.749
government of dos Santos the father

259
00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:59.850
restricted access to the country for

260
00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:01.499
international journalists in fact most

261
00:09:59.85 --> 00:10:03.749
of the corruption scandals we know about

262
00:10:01.499 --> 00:10:10.139
have been discovered by the governments

263
00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:11.970
of the US and the UK of course with a

264
00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:13.649
political climate like this no Angolan

265
00:10:11.97 --> 00:10:15.179
wanted to start company at the end of

266
00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:16.769
the day the reality was that you needed

267
00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:19.350
to be a millionaire in order to pay

268
00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:21.660
those various bribes and even if we

269
00:10:19.35 --> 00:10:23.730
would put the cost of bribery aside just

270
00:10:21.66 --> 00:10:26.040
with the basic bureaucracy you'll need a

271
00:10:23.73 --> 00:10:28.649
thousand US dollars to start a normal

272
00:10:26.04 --> 00:10:30.509
bar in Rwanda in the country as poor as

273
00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:34.529
Angola a thousand dollars is an absolute

274
00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:36.179
fortune but not only that these

275
00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:38.040
international companies were not willing

276
00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:40.649
to invest in the country more than the

277
00:10:38.04 --> 00:10:42.660
absolute minimum required to extract the

278
00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:44.459
oil so now you might wonder what were

279
00:10:42.66 --> 00:10:46.769
the consequences of all this well the

280
00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:50.210
outcome is that dinosaur juice is the

281
00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:52.520
only Angolan export

282
00:10:50.21 --> 00:10:54.440
in fact in the last decade the only new

283
00:10:52.52 --> 00:10:56.690
Angolan businesses were crude oil

284
00:10:54.44 --> 00:10:58.550
extraction plants and houses for its

285
00:10:56.69 --> 00:11:03.190
workers by the year 2014

286
00:10:58.55 --> 00:11:06.429
oil represented 97% of Angolan exports

287
00:11:03.19 --> 00:11:06.429
[Music]

288
00:11:06.51 --> 00:11:09.480
now at this point if you're a regular

289
00:11:08.13 --> 00:11:11.250
visual politic view you might be

290
00:11:09.48 --> 00:11:12.899
thinking this sounds pretty familiar to

291
00:11:11.25 --> 00:11:15.510
me and that's probably because you've

292
00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:18.029
seen our videos on Venezuela a country

293
00:11:15.51 --> 00:11:19.560
with a similar economic system just like

294
00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:22.040
what happens in Nicolas maduro's country

295
00:11:19.56 --> 00:11:24.899
when the oil market price went down

296
00:11:22.04 --> 00:11:26.490
Angola went right along with it so now

297
00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:28.199
let's go back to the example of the

298
00:11:26.49 --> 00:11:30.000
Chinese Construction Companies many

299
00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:32.250
companies from China invested millions

300
00:11:30.0 --> 00:11:33.899
building entire neighborhoods they expat

301
00:11:32.25 --> 00:11:36.149
professionals coming to the country but

302
00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:38.339
now there's no more oil industry then

303
00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:41.160
therefore there's no more workers

304
00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:44.399
four-lane highways without cars schools

305
00:11:41.16 --> 00:11:46.680
with no pupils in under five years a

306
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:49.709
Chinese company built Columba using

307
00:11:46.68 --> 00:11:52.110
Angola's oil credit lines with China but

308
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:54.899
part of Colombo feel like a ghost town

309
00:11:52.11 --> 00:11:56.940
in summary there is only one winner in

310
00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:58.680
that story and that person is Jose

311
00:11:56.94 --> 00:12:01.350
Eduardo dos Santos and his daughter

312
00:11:58.68 --> 00:12:04.170
Isabel who has already invested these

313
00:12:01.35 --> 00:12:06.209
enormous profits overseas most of the

314
00:12:04.17 --> 00:12:08.730
big Portuguese firms from GA LP to

315

Unitel are now under the control of this

family if Portugal was a colonizer in

317
00:12:11.16 --> 00:12:15.510
the past well they've now become Angola

318
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:18.600
some money launderer and golden elites

319
00:12:15.51 --> 00:12:21.029
have sent an estimated 190 billion

320
00:12:18.6 --> 00:12:23.130
dollars out of the country and while the

321
00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:25.620
entire country is having a crisis isabel

322
00:12:23.13 --> 00:12:28.079

webinar on a twitter account goes out

with celebrities like Kim Kardashian all

325
00:12:31.05 --> 00:12:34.529
of this is being said you might have

326
00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:35.970
guessed that the Dos Santos family is

327
00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:38.080
not that popular you know

330
00:12:40.97 --> 00:12:45.710
right not really in fact their political

331
00:12:43.25 --> 00:12:49.370
party VN PLA keeps stealing the show

332
00:12:45.71 --> 00:12:51.830
election after election getting over 70%

333
00:12:49.37 --> 00:12:54.260
of the votes this past August 2017

334
00:12:51.83 --> 00:12:56.600
Angola held an election and despite the

335
00:12:54.26 --> 00:12:57.830
fact that Josie Eduardo dos Santos was

336
00:12:56.6 --> 00:13:00.890
not accounted as anymore

337
00:12:57.83 --> 00:13:02.210
his party won again and so now you might

338
00:13:00.89 --> 00:13:04.250
be wondering well why does this happen

339
00:13:02.21 --> 00:13:07.210
well I'm afraid that we're probably

340
00:13:04.25 --> 00:13:10.850
never going to know

342
00:13:10.85 --> 00:13:14.060

343
00:13:12.44 --> 00:13:16.610
going to be possible find gonna to get

344
00:13:14.06 --> 00:13:18.080

345
00:13:16.61 --> 00:13:20.720
