[Music]

3
00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.160
okay before we get started with today's

4
00:00:09.33 --> 00:00:12.870
video I've got to give you two warnings

5
00:00:11.16 --> 00:00:15.240
the first is that we might have lewd

6
00:00:12.87 --> 00:00:17.100
some spoilers about narcos obviously be

7
00:00:15.24 --> 00:00:19.350
given that it's a TV show based on real

8
00:00:17.1 --> 00:00:21.090
history I don't think this is so much of

9
00:00:19.35 --> 00:00:22.560
a problem and the second warning is that

10
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:24.269
today we're going to talk about drug

11
00:00:22.56 --> 00:00:25.439
trafficking a topic where the

12
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.330
information we have it's pretty

13
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.769
incomplete and all the time - Lisa

14
00:00:27.33 --> 00:00:35.070
finding new bits of information that

15
00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.570
could prove parts of this video wrong so

16
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:38.610
that being said let's move on to

17
00:00:36.57 --> 00:00:40.950
Colombia the country that is known of

18
00:00:38.61 --> 00:00:42.930
the country of a thousand rhythms the

19
00:00:40.95 --> 00:00:45.000
country of coffee and the birthplace of

20
00:00:42.93 --> 00:00:46.829
so many of those Latino singers they got

21
00:00:45.0 --> 00:00:49.410
the whole world to dance nevertheless

22
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.129
what really made this country famous is

23
00:00:49.41 --> 00:00:54.989
sadly this man Pablo immunised quadriga

24
00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.120
video I simply wasn't there to keep

25
00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.890
Westeros cool the king of cocaine the

26
00:00:57.12 --> 00:01:01.020
man who basically created one of the

27
00:00:58.89 --> 00:01:02.879
world's most dangerous industries at the

28
00:01:01.02 --> 00:01:04.890
end of the 1980s Pablo Escobar

29
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.860
or el patron as his neighbors used to

30
00:01:04.89 --> 00:01:10.590
know him controlled 90% of the worldwide

31
00:01:07.86 --> 00:01:12.689
production of cocaine suddenly Marian a

32
00:01:10.59 --> 00:01:14.970
city of 2 million inhabitants became the

33
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.150
Hollywood of cocaine however on December

34
00:01:14.97 --> 00:01:20.759
the 1st 1993 he died during a shootout

35
00:01:18.15 --> 00:01:22.920
with the police but you probably already

36
00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.070
knew that so the question now becomes

37
00:01:22.92 --> 00:01:28.290
well what happens after Pablo who took

38
00:01:26.07 --> 00:01:30.390
his business and then there is the most

39
00:01:28.29 --> 00:01:32.520
important question of all and that is is

40
00:01:30.39 --> 00:01:34.350
there still cocaine trafficking in

41
00:01:32.52 --> 00:01:35.400
Colombia well today we're certainly

42
00:01:34.35 --> 00:01:38.159
going to answer all of those questions

43
00:01:35.4 --> 00:01:42.049
but before we get into any of that let's

44
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.049
talk a little bit about cocaine

45
00:01:43.25 --> 00:01:48.680
[Music]

46
00:01:45.82 --> 00:01:50.750
after weed cocaine is the second most

47
00:01:48.68 --> 00:01:51.560
consumed drug in the world but unlike

48
00:01:50.75 --> 00:01:53.479
the first one

49
00:01:51.56 --> 00:01:55.580
cocaine is extremely hard to find

50
00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.530
marijuana it grows anywhere on the

51
00:01:55.58 --> 00:02:00.200
planet even in cold places like North

52
00:01:57.53 --> 00:02:01.880
America grow houses are found all the

53
00:02:00.2 --> 00:02:04.009
time and with just a little bit of

54
00:02:01.88 --> 00:02:06.380
expenditure anyone can create at home

55
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.539
the optimal conditions for growing

56
00:02:06.38 --> 00:02:10.610
cannabis but coca leaves they are a

57
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.950
different animal you need a very

58
00:02:10.61 --> 00:02:15.110
specific habitat to grow them and this

59
00:02:12.95 --> 00:02:16.730
is why only some countries can grow

60
00:02:15.11 --> 00:02:20.080
these leaves the main countries are

61
00:02:16.73 --> 00:02:20.080
Colombia Peru and Bolivia

62
00:02:20.37 --> 00:02:23.469
[Applause]

63
00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.939
in other words there is just space for a

64
00:02:28.14 --> 00:02:32.549
few suppliers but on the other hand the

65
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.829
demand he won't stop growing and well

66
00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.870
it's a global demands this is why

67
00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.030
cocaine is such a high profit business

68
00:02:36.87 --> 00:02:40.799
and this is why right after Pablo

69
00:02:39.03 --> 00:02:44.420
Escobar's death there were lots of

70
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.420
people willing to take his place

71
00:02:45.53 --> 00:02:49.319
Mafia Wars

72
00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.510
as you know Pablo Escobar was the leader

73
00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.260
of the Medellin Cartel but even before

74
00:02:51.51 --> 00:02:54.000
his death

75
00:02:52.26 --> 00:02:56.220
there was already a second cocaine

76
00:02:54.0 --> 00:02:59.129
capital and that was the city of Cali

77
00:02:56.22 --> 00:03:01.409
also in Colombia and with a very similar

78
00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.810
population where Pablo left a trail of

79
00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.459
bodies and chaos ins wake Callie may

80
00:03:03.81 --> 00:03:07.700
problems disappear with an army of

81
00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.799
lawyers and a mountain of legal briefs

82
00:03:07.7 --> 00:03:14.069
the meting cartel was Miami swimming

elegant smooth subtle where they could

86
00:03:21.51 --> 00:03:25.530
fuel the 24-hour nightlife with cocaine

87
00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.769
and still make sure everybody showed up

88
00:03:25.53 --> 00:03:31.019
for work on Wall Street the next morning

89

involved blood and never bleep flows the

Cali cartel they wanted to take the

93
00:03:39.87 --> 00:03:44.220
whole of Escobar's business but Betty

94
00:03:42.18 --> 00:03:46.199
Nina had plenty of knockers who wanted

95
00:03:44.22 --> 00:03:48.659
to do the same thing one of them was

longer helps the police deal with Pablo

100
00:03:55.67 --> 00:03:59.870
Escobar made an alliance with the Cali

101
00:03:57.56 --> 00:04:02.090
cartel and even had close ties with a

102
00:03:59.87 --> 00:04:04.580
right-wing paramilitary group called the

103
00:04:02.09 --> 00:04:06.200
Colombian self-defense forces with Pablo

104
00:04:04.58 --> 00:04:08.030
Escobar dead and buried Don Berna

105
00:04:06.2 --> 00:04:09.650

smaller narcos in medellin were also

fighting for their share the street you

110
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.170
see on the screen was the border between

oficina Envigado and crossed the street

115
00:04:28.21 --> 00:04:32.920
someone would kill you immediately so as

116
00:04:31.03 --> 00:04:34.750
you could imagine these were extremely

117

violent times for the city different

pretty much all the time

120
00:04:37.81 --> 00:04:40.900
meanwhile the Cali cartel was way more

121
00:04:40.24 --> 00:04:42.940
subtle

122
00:04:40.9 --> 00:04:44.980
this is Gilberto Rodriguez and his

Gilberto Rodriguez paid over 6 million

among all the characters that appear on

who has lasted the longest without being

00:05:20.47 --> 00:05:23.680
put behind bars but wait just a minute

142
00:05:22.48 --> 00:05:24.880
because now we can talk about the

00:05:23.68 --> 00:05:26.590
characters that didn't appear on the

there's a lot to tell remember how Don

Berna was working with this right-wing

148
00:05:32.32 --> 00:05:36.100
group well the political ideology was

149
00:05:34.48 --> 00:05:37.510
more important than what you might think

150
00:05:36.1 --> 00:05:39.640
for this group the Colombian

151
00:05:37.51 --> 00:05:41.950
self-defense forces they were born to

152

the country

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia

00:05:47.67 --> 00:05:53.170
FARC fog it's more than just a simple

156
00:05:50.92 --> 00:05:54.820
terrorist group in some areas of the

157
00:05:53.17 --> 00:05:56.770

00:05:57.76 --> 00:06:01.750
compared with - or Islamic state even

Marxist Leninist group FARC they have

164
00:06:05.47 --> 00:06:08.770
their own doctors their own hospitals

165
00:06:06.97 --> 00:06:11.650
and of course they collected their own

166
00:06:08.77 --> 00:06:13.930
taxes say FEMA Carrie listen let's say

167
00:06:11.65 --> 00:06:16.900
this group has over 20,000 members

168
00:06:13.93 --> 00:06:19.720
spread across 24 of Colombia's 32

169
00:06:16.9 --> 00:06:21.040
provinces as you can imagine FARC they

170
00:06:19.72 --> 00:06:21.880
were not good friends of drug

171
00:06:21.04 --> 00:06:23.680
trafficking

172
00:06:21.88 --> 00:06:25.720
yes drug traffickers and terrorists they

173
00:06:23.68 --> 00:06:27.070
do have common enemies but the idea of

174
00:06:25.72 --> 00:06:28.600
becoming a millionaire by selling a

175
00:06:27.07 --> 00:06:31.090
product on the international market

176
00:06:28.6 --> 00:06:32.260
doesn't sound very Marxist besides

177
00:06:31.09 --> 00:06:34.180
extortion and kidnapping

178
00:06:32.26 --> 00:06:36.400
they were pretty lucrative businesses as

179
00:06:34.18 --> 00:06:38.410
well and FARC they were experts on these

180
00:06:36.4 --> 00:06:40.780
matters add to this the fact that Don

181
00:06:38.41 --> 00:06:42.430
Berna and his office Enid and Vigano who

182
00:06:40.78 --> 00:06:44.860
had an anti-communist group on their

183
00:06:42.43 --> 00:06:47.650
side and you can imagine of the war that

184
00:06:44.86 --> 00:06:50.370
was about to happen only CPU they all

185
00:06:47.65 --> 00:06:53.290
had yeah this is the boy aha

186
00:06:50.37 --> 00:06:56.020
Municipality today it's covered by

187
00:06:53.29 --> 00:06:58.150
plants and trees that is the north part

188
00:06:56.02 --> 00:07:00.130
from where FARC launched rockets to the

189
00:06:58.15 --> 00:07:01.930
other part of the municipality but well

190
00:07:00.13 --> 00:07:03.580
business is business and the matter the

191
00:07:01.93 --> 00:07:05.980
money fought could make with kidnapping

192
00:07:03.58 --> 00:07:07.930
it was hard to resist the temptation of

193
00:07:05.98 --> 00:07:10.030
drug trafficking so one day medina

194
00:07:07.93 --> 00:07:12.860
caracas one of the main thought leaders

195
00:07:10.03 --> 00:07:15.770
decided to try the cocaine business

196
00:07:12.86 --> 00:07:18.209
[Music]

197
00:07:15.77 --> 00:07:21.599
sixteenth front of the bark went from

198
00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:23.580
200 members to over 800 due to cocaine

199
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.619
revenue which became one of the primary

200
00:07:23.58 --> 00:07:26.369
waves the Korea's finance their

201
00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:28.139
activities

202
00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:30.389
don't forget the fart had the control of

203
00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.879
all the areas where coca plantations

204
00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.679
were in fact they had already extorted

205
00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:37.139
the growers nonetheless with Medina

206
00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:39.419
Caracas as leader FARC created their own

207
00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:41.789
fields and their own distribution

208
00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.830
networks this it was all happening by

209
00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:45.959
the year 2000 at this time the Cali

210
00:07:43.83 --> 00:07:48.089
cartel it was already dismantled but

211
00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:53.369
cocaine it was still employing a good

212
00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:54.959
share of the Colombian workforce so well

213
00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:57.330
to summarize on the one hand we have the

214
00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:59.669
oficina to n vanguard o with dom burner

215
00:07:57.33 --> 00:08:01.499
as the leader and then we have FARC on

216
00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:03.839
the other hand and between these two

217
00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:06.449
there's also a plethora of independent

218
00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.800
drug trafficking bands called the back

219
00:08:06.449 --> 00:08:09.929
rim it was during this time that

220
00:08:07.8 --> 00:08:12.659
Colombia chosen new President Alvaro

221
00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:14.699
Uribe Uribe was born in Medellin and his

222
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:16.949
political goal was to end all the

223
00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:22.769
violence and well this marked the

224
00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:24.990
beginning of the Huck's mafioso Alvaro

225
00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:27.209
Uribe was ready to end the guerrilla

226
00:08:24.99 --> 00:08:29.909
warriors and the right-wing groups at

227
00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:32.039
any cost this is why in the year 2005

228
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:34.169
his defense minister Camilo ospina

229
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.180
signed a law that is thought of with

230
00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:39.569
sadness in Colombia this law was

231
00:08:36.18 --> 00:08:41.159
directive 0 to 9 and well now you might

232
00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:42.839
be wondering well what's so sad about

233
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.449
that it sounds like it could be a good

234
00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:47.220
thing this directive said literally that

235
00:08:45.449 --> 00:08:50.339
the government would give the equivalent

236
00:08:47.22 --> 00:08:52.230
of 19 hundred US dollars to anyone who

237
00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:55.540
would murder agrea fighter or a

238
00:08:52.23 --> 00:08:57.860
paramilitary right-wing fighter

239
00:08:55.54 --> 00:08:59.940
[Music]

240
00:08:57.86 --> 00:09:01.380
basically if you were a soldier in the

241
00:08:59.94 --> 00:09:03.390
Colombian Army and you wanted to have a

242
00:09:01.38 --> 00:09:06.030
good career all you had to do was get

243
00:09:03.39 --> 00:09:07.800
out and go on a manhunt and all of a

244
00:09:06.03 --> 00:09:10.860
sudden well the death toll at FARC and

245
00:09:07.8 --> 00:09:12.300
Monaco's it absolutely skyrocketed but

246
00:09:10.86 --> 00:09:13.200
hollow a minute because this was just

247
00:09:12.3 --> 00:09:15.180
the beginning

248
00:09:13.2 --> 00:09:17.130
finding FARC members it wasn't an easy

249
00:09:15.18 --> 00:09:19.710
job but the reward given by the

250
00:09:17.13 --> 00:09:21.420
Colombian government was really really

251
00:09:19.71 --> 00:09:23.820
tempting this is why a lot of soldiers

252
00:09:21.42 --> 00:09:25.740
started killing innocent civilians after

253
00:09:23.82 --> 00:09:27.720
that they would dress them in a FARC

254
00:09:25.74 --> 00:09:29.790
uniform and take a picture of the dead

255
00:09:27.72 --> 00:09:31.710
body this was enough to go to the

256
00:09:29.79 --> 00:09:33.720
government office and get the money and

257
00:09:31.71 --> 00:09:35.760
this is something that happens way more

258
00:09:33.72 --> 00:09:37.620
than once or twice there is even a name

259
00:09:35.76 --> 00:09:39.390
for it in Colombia the dead civilians

260
00:09:37.62 --> 00:09:41.220
were called false positives and it

261
00:09:39.39 --> 00:09:43.470
became a major way for people to make

262
00:09:41.22 --> 00:09:46.500
money in Colombia still today the

263
00:09:43.47 --> 00:09:48.270
Colombian justice system has over 3,000

264
00:09:46.5 --> 00:09:50.160
ongoing cases of false positives that

265
00:09:48.27 --> 00:09:51.570
need to be investigated but wait a

266
00:09:50.16 --> 00:09:53.310
minute because while the policies of

267
00:09:51.57 --> 00:09:56.160
President a rebate were extremely

268
00:09:53.31 --> 00:09:58.500
controversial one thing has to be set he

269
00:09:56.16 --> 00:10:00.270
made it way more complicated for FARC

270
00:09:58.5 --> 00:10:02.040
guerrilla warriors raids on cocaine

271
00:10:00.27 --> 00:10:04.050
fields and distribution networks they

272
00:10:02.04 --> 00:10:05.880
became the norm and when your enemy is

273
00:10:04.05 --> 00:10:08.430
killing dozens of your members you are

274
00:10:05.88 --> 00:10:10.940
willing to sign an alliance with the

275
00:10:08.43 --> 00:10:10.940
devil himself

276
00:10:12.62 --> 00:10:18.210
some emails prove the links between the

277
00:10:15.78 --> 00:10:20.670
FARC and the narco traffickers and one

278
00:10:18.21 --> 00:10:23.040
of the messages amigo Conejo a guerilla

279
00:10:20.67 --> 00:10:30.540
leader shows a clear connection with the

280
00:10:23.04 --> 00:10:32.730
oficina the Envigado as we said before

281
00:10:30.54 --> 00:10:34.830
folk were present at all the plantations

282
00:10:32.73 --> 00:10:37.260
in some cases those plantations they

283
00:10:34.83 --> 00:10:39.180
belong to the oficina to Envigado more

284
00:10:37.26 --> 00:10:41.190
son belongs to the back rim that we

285
00:10:39.18 --> 00:10:43.500
mentioned earlier on the other hand some

286
00:10:41.19 --> 00:10:45.780
temptations were managed directly by

287
00:10:43.5 --> 00:10:48.210
FARC these are where they grew and

288
00:10:45.78 --> 00:10:50.280
processed coca leaves and turns them

289
00:10:48.21 --> 00:10:52.530
into white powder then the big cartel

290
00:10:50.28 --> 00:10:54.540
stepped in to distribute the cocaine to

291
00:10:52.53 --> 00:10:56.580
other countries nonetheless unlike the

292
00:10:54.54 --> 00:10:57.870
times of Pablo Escobar Colombian cartels

293
00:10:56.58 --> 00:10:58.700
no longer have a monopoly over

294
00:10:57.87 --> 00:11:02.160
distribution

295
00:10:58.7 --> 00:11:04.990
[Music]

296
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:07.029
for instance when those Colombian narcos

297
00:11:04.99 --> 00:11:09.160
want to send cocaine to the US they

298
00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:10.930
partner with Mexican drug dealers when

299
00:11:09.16 --> 00:11:13.480
they want to send it to Europe they work

300
00:11:10.93 --> 00:11:14.829
with Italian Greek and Albanian Mathias

301
00:11:13.48 --> 00:11:16.600
but we're gonna talk about all of that

302
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:18.610
in another video and not today

303
00:11:16.6 --> 00:11:20.559
the important thing is despite drug

304
00:11:18.61 --> 00:11:23.170
trafficking still being an issue today

305
00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:24.759
meta-gene is now a peaceful City of

306
00:11:23.17 --> 00:11:26.050
course there are still bad neighborhoods

307
00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:27.639
where it's better not to walk through

308
00:11:26.05 --> 00:11:29.259
especially on the outskirts of the city

309
00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:31.180
but the city has made a big change

310
00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:33.040
change for the better

311
00:11:31.18 --> 00:11:34.749
this pacts mafioso has allowed all the

312
00:11:33.04 --> 00:11:36.639
players involved with the cocaine

313
00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:38.499
business to make an agreement so that

314
00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:40.149
each of them has their territories and

315
00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.720
they have no reason to kill each other

316
00:11:40.149 --> 00:11:42.730
yes

317
00:11:40.72 --> 00:11:47.050
cocaine is now easier to find than ever

318
00:11:42.73 --> 00:11:48.070
but less people die during the process

319
00:11:47.05 --> 00:11:50.440
[Music]

320
00:11:48.07 --> 00:11:52.569
[Applause]

321
00:11:50.44 --> 00:11:54.279
so now you might be wondering well what

322
00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:56.079
can happen now that FARC have made a

323
00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:57.550
peace agreement with the Colombian

324
00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:59.379
government well this could become an

325
00:11:57.55 --> 00:12:01.509
opportunity for the back room to take

326
00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:03.699
back control of the business that is now

327
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:05.019
in the gorillas hands but the truth is

328
00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:05.980
those narcos they were also trying to

329
00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:08.170
get a peace agreement with the

330
00:12:05.98 --> 00:12:10.389
government that is just as profitable as

331
00:12:08.17 --> 00:12:12.160
the one the FARC and negotiating crazy

332
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:14.050
as it sounds FARC claims to be a

333
00:12:12.16 --> 00:12:16.120
political group with their ideology and

334
00:12:14.05 --> 00:12:18.689
propaganda even available on their

335
00:12:16.12 --> 00:12:21.430
website which can be visited by anyone

336
00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:23.410
this is why they sit on equal terms with

337
00:12:21.43 --> 00:12:26.139
the government however backroom are seen

338
00:12:23.41 --> 00:12:28.810
as normal criminals with no politics or

339
00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:30.550
ideology whatsoever and of course well

340
00:12:28.81 --> 00:12:32.290
