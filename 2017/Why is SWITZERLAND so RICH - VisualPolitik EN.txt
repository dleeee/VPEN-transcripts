1
00:00:06.5 --> 00:00:10.260
often people think that Switzerland

2
00:00:08.25 --> 00:00:13.170
wealth comes only because of their

3
00:00:10.26 --> 00:00:14.519
status as a fiscal Haven so think about

4
00:00:13.17 --> 00:00:17.010
it there are other countries like Panama

5
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.920
Cyprus the Republic of Liberia

6
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:22.619
these are fiscal Athens - don't forget

7
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:24.210
Africa not only offers low taxes to

8
00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.670
international companies but it's also

9
00:00:24.21 --> 00:00:28.590
offers them capacity refills these

10
00:00:26.67 --> 00:00:30.390
countries remain low income countries

11
00:00:28.59 --> 00:00:33.090
while Switzerland remains one of the

12
00:00:30.39 --> 00:00:35.219
wealthiest countries in the world and

13
00:00:33.09 --> 00:00:37.770
all this comes with them having no

14
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.690
natural resources not compromising on

15
00:00:37.77 --> 00:00:44.040
democracy or stupid right if I

16
00:00:42.69 --> 00:00:46.410
Switzerland have one of the most

17
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:48.600
egalitarian political systems in the

18
00:00:46.41 --> 00:00:51.329
world and its welfare system is as good

19
00:00:48.6 --> 00:00:52.860
as that of Norway Denmark additionally

20
00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.410
their citizen is nothing we have the

21
00:00:52.86 --> 00:00:56.309
right to vote every four years but every

22
00:00:55.41 --> 00:00:57.899
four months

23
00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.640
the Swiss don't just choose their

24
00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.949
leaders that they choose their policies

25
00:00:59.64 --> 00:01:03.840
with referendums happening several times

26
00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
a year Switzerland has one of the

27
00:01:03.84 --> 00:01:07.860
world's best political systems and we

28
00:01:06.03 --> 00:01:09.930
believe that this is the reason that

29
00:01:07.86 --> 00:01:11.909
they are successful in fact we think

30
00:01:09.93 --> 00:01:13.500
that the Swift system should be a model

31
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.520
for other countries and in this video

32
00:01:13.5 --> 00:01:16.520
we're going to tell you why

33
00:01:17.81 --> 00:01:23.670
with some number1 decentralization from

34
00:01:22.44 --> 00:01:25.430
a practical point of view

35
00:01:23.67 --> 00:01:27.540
Switzerland is what is known as a

36
00:01:25.43 --> 00:01:29.580
confederation in fact it's the only

37
00:01:27.54 --> 00:01:32.670
Confederation that exists on the planet

38
00:01:29.58 --> 00:01:34.979
it is made up of 26 states which are

39
00:01:32.67 --> 00:01:36.510
called Canton the only thing that these

40
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
Kansans have in common are a

41
00:01:36.51 --> 00:01:40.950
constitution foreign policy and the

42
00:01:38.85 --> 00:01:43.290
currency aside from that they are

43
00:01:40.95 --> 00:01:45.180
totally different from one another let's

44
00:01:43.29 --> 00:01:48.060
look at an example let's say you make a

45
00:01:45.18 --> 00:01:50.520
salary of six thousand Swiss francs and

46
00:01:48.06 --> 00:01:52.320
you live in the region of Jura in that

47
00:01:50.52 --> 00:01:55.380
case you're going to pay income tax of

48
00:01:52.32 --> 00:01:56.910
14% but if you made the same amount of

49
00:01:55.38 --> 00:01:59.460
money and you live in the region of the

50
00:01:56.91 --> 00:02:00.870
zhuge your income tax is only going to

51
00:01:59.46 --> 00:02:03.619
be 4%

52
00:02:00.87 --> 00:02:06.119
[Music]

53
00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.220
let's look at a different example if you

54
00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.220
have a shop in Geneva then you're going

55
00:02:08.22 --> 00:02:13.110
to have to close your shop at 6 p.m. but

56
00:02:11.22 --> 00:02:14.970
if you own a shop in Zurich you're free

57
00:02:13.11 --> 00:02:17.280
to keep your shop open for as many hours

58
00:02:14.97 --> 00:02:20.070
and you want because of the system

59
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:22.410
candles can adjust their laws Sakuni era

60
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:25.500
teas of each individual territory and

61
00:02:22.41 --> 00:02:29.959
what is even more important than this is

62
00:02:25.5 --> 00:02:29.959
that they can compete with each other

63
00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.049
this explains why in general the

64
00:02:33.84 --> 00:02:39.299
councils have such low taxation but our

65
00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.000
story doesn't end here

66
00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.519
Switzerland is so decentralized that

67
00:02:42.0 --> 00:02:47.220
they have four official languages German

68
00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.900
French Italian and Romansh this means

69
00:02:47.22 --> 00:02:50.730
that if you have to go to Geneva which

70
00:02:48.9 --> 00:02:53.340
is a french-speaking part you're not

71
00:02:50.73 --> 00:02:54.959
going to hear anyone speaking German the

72
00:02:53.34 --> 00:02:57.840
billboards the road signs the local

73
00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.880
newspapers everything is in French the

74
00:02:57.84 --> 00:03:03.290
same goes for Zurich with German or

75
00:02:59.88 --> 00:03:03.290
Lugano with Italian

76
00:03:05.23 --> 00:03:10.790
number two Switzerland has no president

77
00:03:09.17 --> 00:03:12.590
every country has a head of government

78
00:03:10.79 --> 00:03:15.980
who is responsible for certain things

79
00:03:12.59 --> 00:03:17.720
right well no not Whitmer but don't get

80
00:03:15.98 --> 00:03:20.450
me wrong they're not division Anarchy or

81
00:03:17.72 --> 00:03:22.310
anything this is what they do they vote

82
00:03:20.45 --> 00:03:24.470
for a Federal Parliament which is

83
00:03:22.31 --> 00:03:26.960
similar to Congress in the United States

84
00:03:24.47 --> 00:03:28.490
of America this Parliament then chooses

85
00:03:26.96 --> 00:03:30.160
seven people who are going to become

86
00:03:28.49 --> 00:03:33.950
something like ministers or secretaries

87
00:03:30.16 --> 00:03:36.700
all of these people have the same amount

88
00:03:33.95 --> 00:03:36.700
of power

89
00:03:37.12 --> 00:03:41.930
each year one of them takes a turn

90
00:03:39.77 --> 00:03:44.720
becoming Switzerland international

91
00:03:41.93 --> 00:03:46.550
representative technically this person

92
00:03:44.72 --> 00:03:48.920
uses the president of Switzerland but

93
00:03:46.55 --> 00:03:51.380
they have no specific powers over the

94
00:03:48.92 --> 00:03:54.230
other six people and as I said they

95
00:03:51.38 --> 00:03:55.790
rotate this person every year this is an

96
00:03:54.23 --> 00:03:57.800
important difference in the twist

97
00:03:55.79 --> 00:03:59.750
mentality because in other countries the

98
00:03:57.8 --> 00:04:01.820
president is mean really powerful

99
00:03:59.75 --> 00:04:03.740
fascist but in Switzerland it's just a

100
00:04:01.82 --> 00:04:08.930
symbolic thing because all of the

101
00:04:03.74 --> 00:04:11.870
decision-making is done by a team number

102
00:04:08.93 --> 00:04:14.210
three they erect democracy this is the

103
00:04:11.87 --> 00:04:17.060
most important part of Swiss politics

104
00:04:14.21 --> 00:04:18.980
and back of vengeance in fact most of

105
00:04:17.06 --> 00:04:20.960
their laws are chosen by a popular vote

106
00:04:18.98 --> 00:04:22.790
some at the federal level some of the

107
00:04:20.96 --> 00:04:25.100
cantonal level the proposal for a

108
00:04:22.79 --> 00:04:26.750
referendum only requires 50,000

109
00:04:25.1 --> 00:04:28.540
signatures while one that's it's going

110
00:04:26.75 --> 00:04:30.650
to amend the Constitution requires

111
00:04:28.54 --> 00:04:32.660
100,000 now don't get me wrong other

112
00:04:30.65 --> 00:04:34.760
countries do allow their populations to

113
00:04:32.66 --> 00:04:36.500
have referendums for example in Spain

114
00:04:34.76 --> 00:04:39.440
this is totally possible but a

115
00:04:36.5 --> 00:04:41.270
referendum proposal requires 500,000

116
00:04:39.44 --> 00:04:42.620
signatures and they can't do any

117
00:04:41.27 --> 00:04:44.649
referendums that will change the

118
00:04:42.62 --> 00:04:47.269
constitution

119
00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:49.610
because of this system Switzerland holds

120
00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:51.709
several referendums every single year

121
00:04:49.61 --> 00:04:53.419
every four months this way go to the

122
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.249
polling station and they will vote on

123
00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.769
any proposals that have been put forward

124
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.029
in the previous four months now let's

125
00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:02.569
look at an example of one of these

126
00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.949
referendums from the Year 2015 they had

127
00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.499
to choose whether they wanted to create

128
00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.869
a basic income for every Swiss citizens

129
00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:10.729
they said no by the way they also had to

130
00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:12.799
decide on some amendments to the

131
00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.629
assisted reproduction Act and the also

132
00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:17.029
at devotions and laws related to public

133
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.179
transport interestingly these poles

134
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:22.699
often have a really big turnout 60% of

135
00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:29.089
Swiss people for this 2015 referendum

136
00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:30.559
went to the polls number for free-market

137
00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:32.569
some of you might think that it's very

138
00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:35.209
easy for a populist anti-capitalist

139
00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.219
leader to emerge in a system like this

140
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:39.769
but make no mistake

141
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.869
Switzerland is to the free market like

142
00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.909
France is to its wine

143
00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.559
don't forget this country is isolated in

144
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.809
the mountains and has practically no

145
00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:49.729
farming map this means that it has to

146
00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:52.669
find free trade agreements with pretty

147
00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.469
much every country on Earth but hold on

148
00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.079
my dear libertarian friends who are

149
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.569
watching this video hold on for just one

150
00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:03.589
second yes it is true that Switzerland

151
00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:07.389
is a commerce loving nation but no more

152
00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:07.389
so than the European Union

153
00:06:07.66 --> 00:06:11.870
this is a twist actually subsidized

154
00:06:10.31 --> 00:06:14.300
their agriculture as much as the

155
00:06:11.87 --> 00:06:16.009
European or the Americans do and they

156
00:06:14.3 --> 00:06:18.050
also participate in the same trade

157
00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.820
embargoes that exists with Iran and

158
00:06:18.05 --> 00:06:21.770
Russia the only differences that

159
00:06:19.82 --> 00:06:24.350
Switzerland has embraced free trade

160
00:06:21.77 --> 00:06:26.000
since 1874 while the rest of the world

161
00:06:24.35 --> 00:06:28.160
has only been doing it for the last few

162
00:06:26.0 --> 00:06:29.750
decades and now there is another very

163
00:06:28.16 --> 00:06:32.180
important difference about Switzerland

164
00:06:29.75 --> 00:06:37.220
that we must get into and it's probably

165
00:06:32.18 --> 00:06:40.520
one that you've heard recent number five

166
00:06:37.22 --> 00:06:43.039
recent neutrality Switzerland is one of

167
00:06:40.52 --> 00:06:45.020
these few neutral countries in the world

168
00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.840
this means that they won't participate

169
00:06:45.02 --> 00:06:49.490
in any armed conflict they even stayed

170
00:06:47.84 --> 00:06:51.380
out of world war two despite the fact

171
00:06:49.49 --> 00:06:53.510
that most of the population was against

172
00:06:51.38 --> 00:06:55.760
Hitler thanks to this Switzerland has

173
00:06:53.51 --> 00:06:57.740
never been reconstructed while the rest

174
00:06:55.76 --> 00:06:59.870
of Europe ripped itself apart killing

175
00:06:57.74 --> 00:07:02.330
millions and then spending billions in

176
00:06:59.87 --> 00:07:04.820
reconstruction Switzerland dinners and

177
00:07:02.33 --> 00:07:07.910
they used all of those savings to

178
00:07:04.82 --> 00:07:10.789
improve their system as we all know the

179
00:07:07.91 --> 00:07:16.940
number one enemy of economic program is

180
00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:18.979
war or that Switzerland does have a

181
00:07:16.94 --> 00:07:20.840
military the thing is this army is

182
00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:23.570
entirely defensive and they will only

183
00:07:20.84 --> 00:07:25.280
use it to propel external attacks they

184
00:07:23.57 --> 00:07:27.919
will never use it to fight in anything

185
00:07:25.28 --> 00:07:29.930
outside of self-defense and this is

186
00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.810
where we see one of the few drawbacks of

187
00:07:29.93 --> 00:07:35.360
the Swiss system then military or should

188
00:07:32.81 --> 00:07:37.220
we say their militia every Swiss citizen

189
00:07:35.36 --> 00:07:39.050
must view military service from the age

190
00:07:37.22 --> 00:07:41.539
of eighteen to the age of thirty

191
00:07:39.05 --> 00:07:44.030
spending one month every single year

192
00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:46.039
serving in the military and even after

193
00:07:44.03 --> 00:07:48.500
that service period they must still keep

194
00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:49.849
a Janus home of course Switzerland isn't

195
00:07:48.5 --> 00:07:52.430
the only country that does this with

196
00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:53.410
Norway and Israel also having mandatory

197
00:07:52.43 --> 00:07:56.050
military service

198
00:07:53.41 --> 00:07:58.460
[Music]

199
00:07:56.05 --> 00:08:00.199
plenty of people argue that this system

200
00:07:58.46 --> 00:08:02.389
is good with pundits saying that it

201
00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.880
creates more entrepreneurs and creates

202
00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:06.530
less income despairity don't forget that

203
00:08:04.88 --> 00:08:08.530
during their time in the military is a

204
00:08:06.53 --> 00:08:11.240
rich and the poor are mixing together

205
00:08:08.53 --> 00:08:13.130
several startups and companies have been

206
00:08:11.24 --> 00:08:14.870
created from relationships that were

207
00:08:13.13 --> 00:08:16.729
formed while people were serving in the

208
00:08:14.87 --> 00:08:18.830
military but the big question is what

209
00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:20.479
about Liberty what about the freedom to

210
00:08:18.83 --> 00:08:22.430
choose what gives the government the

211
00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:24.889
right to force you to work in a place

212
00:08:22.43 --> 00:08:26.419
that you might not want to work of

213
00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:27.680
course we don't have the answers to

214
00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:31.970
these questions that they are just

215
00:08:27.68 --> 00:08:34.870
something for you to ponder twisting

216
00:08:31.97 --> 00:08:36.770
number six ease of doing business

217
00:08:34.87 --> 00:08:38.839
finally there is perhaps the most

218
00:08:36.77 --> 00:08:41.779
well-known thing about Switzerland and

219
00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:43.580
that is they're active it's true despite

220
00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:45.680
the differences from one candle to

221
00:08:43.58 --> 00:08:48.410
another Switzerland though typically has

222
00:08:45.68 --> 00:08:50.360
very low taxation further the laws first

223
00:08:48.41 --> 00:08:52.370
off company are fairly simple and anyone

224
00:08:50.36 --> 00:08:53.899
can see those laws by just going online

225
00:08:52.37 --> 00:08:55.880
Switzerland is one of the most

226
00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:57.290
transparent countries in the world

227
00:08:55.88 --> 00:08:58.820
this has encouraged a lot of

228
00:08:57.29 --> 00:09:01.130
international companies to establish

229
00:08:58.82 --> 00:09:02.810
their fiscal residence in Switzerland

230
00:09:01.13 --> 00:09:04.850
but it also makes it very easy for

231
00:09:02.81 --> 00:09:07.850
people in Switzerland to set up their

232
00:09:04.85 --> 00:09:09.500
own company and yes ok-okay banks do

233
00:09:07.85 --> 00:09:11.750
make up a large part of the Swiss

234
00:09:09.5 --> 00:09:13.900
economy but it's probably not as big as

235
00:09:11.75 --> 00:09:13.900
you

236
00:09:14.78 --> 00:09:19.850
there are many many other industries in

237
00:09:17.63 --> 00:09:21.260
Switzerland does the name logitech mean

238
00:09:19.85 --> 00:09:22.460
anything to you well and look at your

239
00:09:21.26 --> 00:09:24.140
mouth look at your webcam you'll

240
00:09:22.46 --> 00:09:26.150
probably see it printed on one of those

241
00:09:24.14 --> 00:09:27.920
things and this is a company that was

242
00:09:26.15 --> 00:09:30.380
formed in Switzerland and then there's a

243
00:09:27.92 --> 00:09:32.480
pharmaceutical so the names Novartis or

244
00:09:30.38 --> 00:09:34.280
hoffman-laroche ring any bells not to

245
00:09:32.48 --> 00:09:36.470
mention of course tourism precision

246
00:09:34.28 --> 00:09:38.090
machinery and their famous watches I'm

247
00:09:36.47 --> 00:09:39.830
pretty sure you could mean five

248
00:09:38.09 --> 00:09:41.960
companies that are from Switzerland of

249
00:09:39.83 --> 00:09:47.030
simplifying meanings and expensive watch

250
00:09:41.96 --> 00:09:49.010
brands and all of this is being done in

251
00:09:47.03 --> 00:09:51.560
a country with a population that is

252
00:09:49.01 --> 00:09:53.330
smaller than New York City as we always

253
00:09:51.56 --> 00:09:55.040
their visual politic it is not the

254
00:09:53.33 --> 00:09:57.320
country's natural resources and it is

255
00:09:55.04 --> 00:09:59.450
not luck but determine whether they are

256
00:09:57.32 --> 00:10:00.970
successful it's their system of

257
00:09:59.45 --> 00:10:03.770
government and their institutions

258
00:10:00.97 --> 00:10:05.450
Vasudha and we believe that the Swiss

259
00:10:03.77 --> 00:10:09.980
have a lot to teach the rest of the

260
00:10:05.45 --> 00:10:11.570
world in this regard so that is just our

261
00:10:09.98 --> 00:10:13.610
opinion do you agree with us do you

262
00:10:11.57 --> 00:10:15.830
disagree with us do you things that your

263
00:10:13.61 --> 00:10:17.900
country could benefit from a system more

264
00:10:15.83 --> 00:10:18.950
like the Swiss let me know what you

265
00:10:17.9 --> 00:10:20.660

266
00:10:18.95 --> 00:10:23.360
