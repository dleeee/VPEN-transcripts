with a population of over 30 million

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:06.330
people kuru is the fourth biggest

3
00:00:04.02 --> 00:00:08.130
country in latin america and one of the

4
00:00:06.33 --> 00:00:11.219
richest countries in the world in terms

5
00:00:08.13 --> 00:00:13.769
of biodiversity and natural resources in

6
00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.410
this vast and Xion country we can find

7
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.869
among other things the biggest silver

8
00:00:16.41 --> 00:00:21.180
reserves the third biggest zinc and

9
00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.699
copper reserves as well as the sixth

10
00:00:21.18 --> 00:00:25.350
biggest gold reserves in the world in

11
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.320
today's video we're going to be talking

12
00:00:25.35 --> 00:00:30.859
all about Peru equal treat our visuals

13
00:00:28.32 --> 00:00:30.859
politic

14
00:00:32.23 --> 00:00:34.290
you

15
00:00:35.85 --> 00:00:40.480
now Peru is still a poor country and

16
00:00:38.86 --> 00:00:42.100
there is still a lot of work to be done

17
00:00:40.48 --> 00:00:45.640
when it comes to its industrial

18
00:00:42.1 --> 00:00:47.620
framework but despite this Peru stands

19
00:00:45.64 --> 00:00:51.010
out among its Latin American neighbors

20
00:00:47.62 --> 00:00:52.810
as an example of reforms done right and

21
00:00:51.01 --> 00:00:55.030
some favors if this process continues

22
00:00:52.81 --> 00:00:58.330
with soon going to be talking about Peru

23
00:00:55.03 --> 00:01:00.760
as a great Latin American power Lima its

24
00:00:58.33 --> 00:01:07.960
capital city already has a higher GDP

25
00:01:00.76 --> 00:01:10.570
than Bolivia its anomic people in the

26
00:01:07.96 --> 00:01:12.670
last decade Peru has recorded the second

27
00:01:10.57 --> 00:01:15.280
biggest growth rate of all countries in

28
00:01:12.67 --> 00:01:17.740
Latin America in the same period its GDP

29
00:01:15.28 --> 00:01:21.340
has more than double the investment rate

30
00:01:17.74 --> 00:01:23.229
has gone from 13% of GDP to 20% and the

31
00:01:21.34 --> 00:01:25.060
poverty rate this is the percentage of

32
00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.640
people who can't afford basic things

33
00:01:25.06 --> 00:01:30.160
like food clothes education and health

34
00:01:27.64 --> 00:01:34.450
care has dropped from rates of over 50%

35
00:01:30.16 --> 00:01:37.150
in the year 2000 to just 22% today this

36
00:01:34.45 --> 00:01:40.330
is a reduction of more than half which

37
00:01:37.15 --> 00:01:43.390
is not bad at all the country with a

38
00:01:40.33 --> 00:01:47.470
higher poverty reduction rate in Latin

39
00:01:43.39 --> 00:01:48.910
America during the last 13 years and say

40
00:01:47.47 --> 00:01:50.770
on top of all that Peru is one of the

41
00:01:48.91 --> 00:01:52.480
least indebted countries in Latin

42
00:01:50.77 --> 00:01:54.670
America and in fact is one of the least

43
00:01:52.48 --> 00:01:57.340
indebted in the whole world this is due

44
00:01:54.67 --> 00:01:59.409
to a strong determination to use public

45
00:01:57.34 --> 00:02:01.990
funds responsibly this is an achievement

46
00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.870
of Peru's previous government which were

47
00:02:01.99 --> 00:02:06.850
led by orient sir mala Alan Garcia and

48
00:02:04.87 --> 00:02:08.560
Alejandro Toledo because of these

49
00:02:06.85 --> 00:02:11.720
leaders the public debt has been reduced

50
00:02:08.56 --> 00:02:14.810
to less than 50% since the year 2000

51
00:02:11.72 --> 00:02:14.810
[Music]

52
00:02:16.39 --> 00:02:21.079
but better still how did it reach a

53
00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.700
political consensus that maintain

54
00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.659
stability with the government budget

55
00:02:22.7 --> 00:02:29.090
while also making pro market policy yeah

56
00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:32.390
but one more anime via energy as we see

57
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:34.700
for yourself butter those mix forty

58
00:02:32.39 --> 00:02:36.950
Robert Bellarmine senior with there are

59
00:02:34.7 --> 00:02:39.260
others now this is probably one of the

60
00:02:36.95 --> 00:02:40.909
most interesting things about Peru and

61
00:02:39.26 --> 00:02:43.310
it's also where they can see other

62
00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.590
countries invaluable lesson we recently

63
00:02:43.31 --> 00:02:47.329
made a video talking about the disaster

64
00:02:45.59 --> 00:02:49.129
that is Venezuela but the interesting

65
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.109
thing is the Peru's economic situation

66
00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:59.240
was pretty similar to Venezuela's in the

67
00:02:51.109 --> 00:03:01.340
1980s so let's have a look at what 85

68
00:02:59.24 --> 00:03:04.230
[Music]

69
00:03:01.34 --> 00:03:06.989
in the 1970s and the beginning of the

70
00:03:04.23 --> 00:03:09.030
1980s the Peruvian government bet on

71
00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.220
boosting the Peruvian economy through

72
00:03:09.03 --> 00:03:12.780
public investment they wanted to replace

73
00:03:11.22 --> 00:03:15.540
imports and to restrict the sale of

74
00:03:12.78 --> 00:03:18.150
foreign product to achieve this they had

75
00:03:15.54 --> 00:03:20.459
to borrow money which shot up the public

76
00:03:18.15 --> 00:03:23.010
debt the results were so bad but when

77
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.440
the oil crisis happened in 1979 and

78
00:03:23.01 --> 00:03:27.120
their economic growth slowed down Peru's

79
00:03:25.44 --> 00:03:29.879
government started to have so many

80
00:03:27.12 --> 00:03:32.220
problems that in 1983 they had to

81
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.079
suspend their payments to their debtors

82
00:03:32.22 --> 00:03:35.760
in other words they failed to pay their

83
00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.760
debts because they ran out of money and

84
00:03:35.76 --> 00:03:41.250
the Peruvian government collapsed from

85
00:03:38.76 --> 00:03:43.709
that moment things went from bad to

86
00:03:41.25 --> 00:03:47.040
worse and when Alan Garcia came to power

87
00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.750
in 1985 the entire country was a bit of

88
00:03:47.04 --> 00:03:51.180
a disaster this is when the government

89
00:03:48.75 --> 00:03:53.730
started to intervene on a massive scale

90
00:03:51.18 --> 00:03:55.640
they started fixing prices and in the

91
00:03:53.73 --> 00:03:58.230
labor markets they reinforced the

92
00:03:55.64 --> 00:03:59.549
important policies which limited the

93
00:03:58.23 --> 00:04:01.799
number of products that were available

94
00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:07.319
to buy and setting an average tariff

95
00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:13.079
which reached 66% of a summit attempt

96
00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:15.150
another one was young I am Sousa the

97
00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.370
public deficit went through the roof and

98
00:04:15.15 --> 00:04:18.780
the informal economy became the norm so

99
00:04:17.37 --> 00:04:21.389
even though there were more than a

100
00:04:18.78 --> 00:04:23.250
hundred taxes the state simply couldn't

101
00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.840
collect them and on top of all that the

102
00:04:23.25 --> 00:04:26.880
government had collapsed so no one

103
00:04:24.84 --> 00:04:29.669
wanted to lend them money now you might

104
00:04:26.88 --> 00:04:31.800
be wondering what exactly did Peru do

105
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.470
well they started to print more money

106
00:04:31.8 --> 00:04:37.139
which basically made the indc Peruvian

107
00:04:34.47 --> 00:04:39.289
currency worse about as much as monopoly

108
00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.289
money

109
00:04:39.43 --> 00:04:43.060
as if all of that wasn't enough for Peru

110
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:45.070
today always they also have to deal with

111
00:04:43.06 --> 00:04:47.710
the narco traffic and terrorist actions

112
00:04:45.07 --> 00:04:49.750
by groups such as M RTA and Sendero

113
00:04:47.71 --> 00:04:51.160
Luminoso which were causing tens of

114
00:04:49.75 --> 00:04:54.130
thousands of deaths all across the

cacao as Vandiver narco traffic on tape

119
00:05:01.21 --> 00:05:05.410
well what was the result of all this

120
00:05:03.1 --> 00:05:08.740
well by the end of the decade GDP had

121
00:05:05.41 --> 00:05:10.840
dropped by 25 cents further its GDP per

122
00:05:08.74 --> 00:05:12.639
capita with similar to the 1960s and

123
00:05:10.84 --> 00:05:14.440
inflation every year was about seven

124
00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.460
thousand five hundred percent it was at

125
00:05:14.44 --> 00:05:17.860
this point that the World Bank

126
00:05:15.46 --> 00:05:20.350
recognized Peru as one of the poorest

133
00:05:36.61 --> 00:05:41.889
he was recording the situation was so

134
00:05:39.46 --> 00:05:43.840
grave that the World Bank estimates that

135
00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.570
if this has never happened pairing of

136
00:05:43.84 --> 00:05:48.970
GDP and purchasing power parity would

137
00:05:46.57 --> 00:05:52.330
today be similar to Italy's Spain or

138
00:05:48.97 --> 00:05:54.639
South Korea's no more no less in many

139
00:05:52.33 --> 00:05:56.440
ways the crisis that Peru faced was very

140
00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.419
similar to the crisis facing Venezuela

141
00:05:56.44 --> 00:06:00.849
today for example you can see lots of

142
00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.409
public spending plenty of taxes lots of

143
00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.150
printing money are dropping the price of

144
00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.610
commodities oh and also plenty of

145
00:06:04.15 --> 00:06:08.110
violence so when we released our video

146
00:06:06.61 --> 00:06:10.300
about Venezuela many people asked what

147
00:06:08.11 --> 00:06:13.620
we would do to solve the problems well

148
00:06:10.3 --> 00:06:13.620
let's have a look up to room

149
00:06:13.81 --> 00:06:22.170
[Music]

150
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:24.570
way too serious in 1990 a strong plan of

151
00:06:22.17 --> 00:06:26.280
reforms and economic stabilization began

152
00:06:24.57 --> 00:06:28.560
and in fact this is the same plan that

153
00:06:26.28 --> 00:06:30.690
really does still exist today it passed

154
00:06:28.56 --> 00:06:32.760
through the following stages in order to

155
00:06:30.69 --> 00:06:35.340
slow down inflation first of all the EMT

156
00:06:32.76 --> 00:06:37.050
was replaced by a new currency the new

157
00:06:35.34 --> 00:06:39.330
soul in addition to this the

158
00:06:37.05 --> 00:06:41.100
dollarization of the economy was allowed

159
00:06:39.33 --> 00:06:42.630
which is essentially where US dollars

160
00:06:41.1 --> 00:06:45.450
are used in dates of a national currency

161
00:06:42.63 --> 00:06:47.430
from that moment monetary stability in

162
00:06:45.45 --> 00:06:50.130
the country became a national priority

163
00:06:47.43 --> 00:06:52.230
the tax system was changed and greatly

164
00:06:50.13 --> 00:06:54.630
simplified with the elimination of 64

165
00:06:52.23 --> 00:06:57.030
taxes further the pension system was

166
00:06:54.63 --> 00:06:58.860
also reformed and the Chilean system was

167
00:06:57.03 --> 00:07:01.230
used as a model but there were also many

168
00:06:58.86 --> 00:07:02.850
improvements made this is actually quite

169
00:07:01.23 --> 00:07:04.470
a controversial topic and something that

170
00:07:02.85 --> 00:07:06.420
we're going to be addressing in a future

173

further an ambitious program to attract

174
00:07:09.12 --> 00:07:12.750
investors and privatized public

175
00:07:10.77 --> 00:07:15.630
utilities was put into motion

176
00:07:12.75 --> 00:07:17.970
soon companies such as Aero Peru electro

177
00:07:15.63 --> 00:07:20.460
Lima and the Peruvian telephone company

178
00:07:17.97 --> 00:07:22.380
were put into private hands a trade open

179
00:07:20.46 --> 00:07:24.660
the strategy was put into place which

180
00:07:22.38 --> 00:07:26.690
reduced that ridiculously high 66

181
00:07:24.66 --> 00:07:29.340
percent tariff to something closer to

182
00:07:26.69 --> 00:07:31.440
1.5 percent at the same time as this

183
00:07:29.34 --> 00:07:33.540
happened numerous free trade deals were

184
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:35.310
signed including very important ones

185
00:07:33.54 --> 00:07:38.340
with the United States as well as the

186
00:07:35.31 --> 00:07:40.350
European Union then in 2002 a gradual

187
00:07:38.34 --> 00:07:41.970
decentralization of power started

188
00:07:40.35 --> 00:07:43.860
happening the result of this was that

189
00:07:41.97 --> 00:07:46.290
most public investment spending today

190
00:07:43.86 --> 00:07:48.900
happens with regions and municipality

191
00:07:46.29 --> 00:07:51.630
and finally and probably the most

192
00:07:48.9 --> 00:07:54.420
important point was their commitment to

193
00:07:51.63 --> 00:07:56.340
budgetary stability this is something

194
00:07:54.42 --> 00:07:58.770
that since it was put into place every

195
00:07:56.34 --> 00:08:00.660
government has respected pero register

Osasco nero actually in 1999 a law which

201
00:08:09.51 --> 00:08:13.680
put in the place called the fiscal

202
00:08:11.37 --> 00:08:15.540
transparency and prudence law this

203
00:08:13.68 --> 00:08:17.130
restricts the discretionary power of

204
00:08:15.54 --> 00:08:19.170
government to spend more than they

205
00:08:17.13 --> 00:08:21.270
receive this includes corrective

206
00:08:19.17 --> 00:08:23.660
elements for public deficit situation

207
00:08:21.27 --> 00:08:25.580
many experts on the subject can test

208
00:08:23.66 --> 00:08:28.790
this is one of the most important laws

209
00:08:25.58 --> 00:08:30.710
in the history of Peru but it's not all

210
00:08:28.79 --> 00:08:33.110
roses don't think that we've forgotten

211
00:08:30.71 --> 00:08:35.419
League dark side of Peru this was

212
00:08:33.11 --> 00:08:37.820
amazing like these cells Berto cookie

213
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.010
Maurice regime this was an authoritarian

214
00:08:37.82 --> 00:08:42.770
regime and the president of it is now

215
00:08:40.01 --> 00:08:44.120
serving a 25 year jail term he was

216
00:08:42.77 --> 00:08:46.520
convicted for crimes against humanity

217
00:08:44.12 --> 00:08:48.440
and corruption what's important to keep

218
00:08:46.52 --> 00:08:50.360
in mind is the situation that Venezuela

219
00:08:48.44 --> 00:08:53.360
faces today is similar to the situation

220
00:08:50.36 --> 00:08:55.450
that Peru faced so keep in mind there's

221
00:08:53.36 --> 00:08:57.850
always a way out

222
00:08:55.45 --> 00:09:02.060

223
00:08:57.85 --> 00:09:03.830
hello today and tomorrow so now you

224
00:09:02.06 --> 00:09:07.220
might have in your mind the question why

225
00:09:03.83 --> 00:09:08.510
is Peru still a poor country today as we

226
00:09:07.22 --> 00:09:10.640
said at the beginning of this video the

227
00:09:08.51 --> 00:09:12.650
institutional shortfalls and the

228
00:09:10.64 --> 00:09:14.930
challenges that Peru faces today are

229
00:09:12.65 --> 00:09:17.600
many among them we can't stress enough

230
00:09:14.93 --> 00:09:19.580
the high degree of legal uncertainty and

231
00:09:17.6 --> 00:09:21.500
corruption this is something that we can

232
00:09:19.58 --> 00:09:23.930
definitely see with the death squads

233
00:09:21.5 --> 00:09:27.290
case this is where under Tomales regime

234
00:09:23.93 --> 00:09:29.150
from 2011 to 2015 a group of policemen

235
00:09:27.29 --> 00:09:31.190
killed innocent people for money those

236
00:09:29.15 --> 00:09:33.080
kills included a general and a major

237
00:09:31.19 --> 00:09:34.940
from Peru's National Police further

238
00:09:33.08 --> 00:09:36.290
there are extremely high levels of crime

239
00:09:34.94 --> 00:09:38.330
and there's also the chance that the

240
00:09:36.29 --> 00:09:40.670
mining industry will face the same Renzi

241
00:09:38.33 --> 00:09:42.440
a problems that Chile faces today not to

242
00:09:40.67 --> 00:09:43.760
mention there is a very sharp difference

243
00:09:42.44 --> 00:09:47.590
between the living standards in

244
00:09:43.76 --> 00:09:50.420
different regions on the 5th of June

245
00:09:47.59 --> 00:09:52.460
2016 the second round of presidential

246
00:09:50.42 --> 00:09:54.710
elections were held where Pedro Pablo

247
00:09:52.46 --> 00:09:57.260
Kaczynski was elected as the new

248
00:09:54.71 --> 00:09:59.180
president of the Republic of Peru these

249
00:09:57.26 --> 00:10:01.520
elections were the closest in Peru's

250
00:09:59.18 --> 00:10:04.280
history and truces in ski beat out his

251
00:10:01.52 --> 00:10:07.040
rival Keiko Fujimori who by the way is

252
00:10:04.28 --> 00:10:09.710
Alberto Fujimori daughter he beat a by

253
00:10:07.04 --> 00:10:12.020
just 40,000 votes the policies announced

254
00:10:09.71 --> 00:10:14.390
by Kaczynski includes to keep working on

255
00:10:12.02 --> 00:10:17.300
the agenda of pushing competitiveness

256
00:10:14.39 --> 00:10:19.370
and trade openness in this regard he is

257
00:10:17.3 --> 00:10:21.230
pledged to reduce tax by 10 percent for

258
00:10:19.37 --> 00:10:23.450
SMEs that small or medium sized

259
00:10:21.23 --> 00:10:25.180
enterprises as well as battle against

260
00:10:23.45 --> 00:10:27.860
bureaucracy remove unnecessary

261
00:10:25.18 --> 00:10:29.300
regulation and to pursue regional

262
00:10:27.86 --> 00:10:34.300
economic integration

263
00:10:29.3 --> 00:10:34.300
similar to the TPP or RCEP led by China

264
00:10:35.53 --> 00:10:39.770
if Kavinsky gets to remain at the helm

265
00:10:38.18 --> 00:10:42.050
and fight all of the problems that are

266
00:10:39.77 --> 00:10:43.310
affecting peru despite his relative

267
00:10:42.05 --> 00:10:45.320
political weakness because they're not

268
00:10:43.31 --> 00:10:47.330
very friendly congress i'm sure that the

269
00:10:45.32 --> 00:10:49.460
growth of peru will continue and will

270
00:10:47.33 --> 00:10:51.530
remain a leader in growth so latin

271
00:10:49.46 --> 00:10:53.090
america and maybe in a few years peru

272
00:10:51.53 --> 00:10:55.670
which is a young nation with an average

273
00:10:53.09 --> 00:10:58.100
age of 27 could follow the example of

274
00:10:55.67 --> 00:11:01.370
the Asian Tigers and get transformed

275
00:10:58.1 --> 00:11:03.230
into a major global power so that is our

276
00:11:01.37 --> 00:11:05.660

become an economic powerhouse and is

280
00:11:10.1 --> 00:11:13.880
