3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,170
recently we've published a lot of videos

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,850
about Venezuela in the terrible

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,890
political situation that that country is

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,630
facing we told you how they've got to

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,670
this point the basic characteristics of

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,590
this narco dictatorship and how the

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,750
revolution involved the Bolivarian

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,279
revolution has condemned most

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,500
Venezuelans to poverty even causing one

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,129
of the greatest Exodus in history

13
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:39,390
Venezuelan refugees now number three

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,280
point four million humanitarian

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,789
implications massive UN warns however

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,680
while events rushing had a warp speed

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,750
with this man Juan Gordo leading a

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,070
thermal position against the Maduro

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,780
regime we thought that we needed to make

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,239
a general review of a fundamental issue

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,730
who Nicolas Maduro is main allies who

22
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,469
are the players that continue despite

23
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,690
everything to support this regime and

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,540
why what are their interests it may seem

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,920
incredible given the current

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,689
circumstances but the Chavez regime

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,580
continues to have some very formidable

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,890
allies and listen up because these are

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,960
the four most influential partners the

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,610
four strongest allies that the

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,460
Venezuelan regime still has forth today

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,240
for you tomorrow for me 2010 saw the

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,310
beginning of a beautiful relationship or

34
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,960
perhaps it would be more accurate to

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,960
call it a hateful fellowship leave that

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,970
up to you to decide Mayor Nicolas Maduro

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,680
travelled to Turkey as Venezuela

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
Stansell a very met current Turkish

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,270
president type arrogant these are two

40
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,399
politicians who feel attacked by the

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,590
West and the relationship is mainly

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,869
based on emotions Berta Wan doesn't

43
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,060
forget that Maduro was one of the first

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,890
leaders who supported him during the

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,670
attempted coup of July 15 2016 now

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,950
turkey is returning the support they

47
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,680
received met/met OSCON center for global

48
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,929
policy of Washington so we can

49
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,670
understand this better the relationship

50
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,080
goes a lot something like

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,850
this hey look it turns out the rest of

52
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,410
the world has it in for us they say that

53
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,600
we're a thorough terian bringing about

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,790
order why such a bad thing

55
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,010
they say we don't respect freedom of the

56
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,110
press either say how about if you

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,840
support me announcer for a year

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,150
these populist and authoritarian leaders

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,890
are seeking to develop man-to-man

60
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,690
relations rather than relying on

61
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,240
institutions bureaucracies or rules Matt

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,280
met bossk on the fact is that since the

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,800
Turkish coup d'etat took place for as is

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,840
suspected the auto coup d'etat trade

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,420
between both countries has multiplied 13

66
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,590
fold in 2018 alone exports from

67
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,780
Venezuela to Turkey surpassed a billion

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,740
dollars and no this wasn't industrial or

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,230
even agricultural products not at all

70
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,120
I'm talking about the last source of

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,590
foreign currency with which the

72
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,510
Venezuela regime has attempted to stay

73
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,080
alive talking about gold turkey has

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,090
become a satellite headquarters for

75
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,280
refining certifying and distributing

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,459
Venezuelan gold it is the perfect

77
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,350
laundry so to speak allowing Nicolas

78
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,970
Maduro as government to continue to

79
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,950
obtain foreign currency this is becoming

80
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,300
more and more complicated however

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,980
especially after the collapse that the

82
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,700
oil industry has been experiencing

83
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,280
Venezuela oil exports slumped to a

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,870
28-year low

85
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,300
[Music]

86
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,680
apparently the agreement that Venezuela

87
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,330
in Turkey signed would be allowing

88
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,070
Caracas to evade United States sanctions

89
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,990
mysterious Turkish firm helped Maduro

90
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,900
move 900 million in gold in the last few

91
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,670
months sightings of private Russian and

92
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,560
Turkish jets have been frequent at

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
Caracas Airport some of them by the way

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,670
around by signer a mining company that

95
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,350
is very close with the president of

96
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,270
Turkey well what is suspected is that

97
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,190
these planes are arriving in Caracas to

98
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,140
get gold from the country in a rather

99
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,140
shady way and I'm sure you can probably

100
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,790
guess where a lot of that gold is gonna

101
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:21,359
end up relationships they go beyond that

102
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,820
in December of 2018 not all that long

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,650
ago arrogance starred in the first visit

104
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,480
of a Turkish head of state to Venezuela

105
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,100
during this trip commercial agreements

106
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,510
with a value of more than five million

107
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,490
dollars were signed into the creation of

108
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,380
joint ventures for exploration and

109
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,110
exploitation of coal gold and oil were

110
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,009
also announced

111
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,619
for example it's highly significant that

112
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,479
the Turkish food industry provides about

113
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,460
70% of the food that the Venezuelan

114
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,469
government distributes under the Clapp

115
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,449
program these are food bags that are

116
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,399
delivered to families monthly as a means

117
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,889
to gain some sort of popular support but

118
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:13,729
let's move on what about my things it's

119
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,779
well known that throughout the

120
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,969
Bolivarian revolution Cuba's role was

121
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:20,500
extremely significant

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,700
[Applause]

123
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,500
[Music]

124
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,140
Cuba first supplied Hugo Chavez and then

125
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,480
Nicolas Maduro with paramilitary forces

126
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,490
protection and intelligence teams

127
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,870
practically everything that the

128
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,940
Venezuelan bigwigs needed to consolidate

129
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,060
their power Venezuela is nine times

130
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,490
larger than Cuba and has three times its

131
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,740
population and its economy as four times

132
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,330
larger the country is home to the

133
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,400
world's largest oil reserves

134
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,530
however some crucial functions of the

135
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,810
Venezuelan State have been delegated to

136
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,310
Cuban officials or are directly

137
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,660
controlled by Havana

138
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:09,620
moisÃ©s many controversial to say but

139
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,169
Cuba has basically become a super market

140
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:14,840
of tariffs of all dictators according to

141
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,160
the Secretary General of the

142
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,840

149
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,960
none of this has come for free

[Music]

152
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,990
you see in exchange for supplying

153
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,330
doctors and paramilitary forces Cuba has

154
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,250
received a lot of oil in more than

155
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,930
advantageous conditions from the

156
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,030
Venezuelan government in recent years in

157
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,530
fact during the Bolivarian revolution

158
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,480
the Cuban economy was very dependent on

159
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,150
Venezuela although not quite as much as

160
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:15,220
the Soviet Union however as things

161
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,200
continued to progress and although they

162
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,910
still seem to be playing a key role in

163
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,950
the repression today the island simply

164
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,690
doesn't have enough economic resources

165
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,690
to keep the narco savez regime on its

166
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,460
feet what I mean is that in the future

167
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,440
Cuba's biggest role may be only to give

168
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,389
refuge that Nicolas Maduro and his

169
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,550
cronies so long as the DEA doesn't

170
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:41,490
capture them first

171
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,510
second business is business if you

follow this channel regularly may know

173

Caracas Beijing relationship and this

175
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,510
isn't an ideological issue it was is and

176
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,550
probably will be with but without Maduro

177
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,270
a pure matter of business oil is the

178
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,729
most fundamental reason why China and

179
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,580
Venezuela joined powers China needed a

180
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,580
lot of oil and Venezuela had it the

181
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,680
relationship flourished since then and

182
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,010
both built ties based on oil financing

the Latin American countries huge energy

193

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,019
economy needed at all costs they're all

195
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,490
consumption rates increase year after

196
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,200

199
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,670
and we are talking about small numbers

200
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,389
here according to data from the Center

201
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,429

University between 2007 and 2008 een

203
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,319
China lent the latin-american country

204
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:23,139
almost seventy billion dollars today the

205
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,029
dev seems to surpass 20 billion and to

206
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,459
be fair we must say that Maduro he

207
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,999
hasn't exactly been a good payer came on

208
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,740

Herondale de the estaba venezuela

210
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,029
Beijing trusted that the Venezuelan

211
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,679
authorities would be able to do

212
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,179
something productive with all of the

213
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,860
money that they put on the table at the

214
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,230
very least invest enough to maintain oil

215
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,509
production levels Beijing never imagined

216
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:47,920
that the Venezuelan government would be

217
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,199
quite so disastrous and so for the

218
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,339
Chinese all of this is just

219
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:53,139
fundamentally a matter of business

220
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:57,910
leading to incidents like this

221
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,850
China sues Venezuela's oil company over

222
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,950
unpaid bills in spite of everything

223
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,690
Beijing suspects that their agreements

224
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,950
could be endangered if there's a

225
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,810
government change which could mean not

226
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,060
charging part of the debt that Venezuela

227
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,460
has to pay in oil or even losing the

228
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,930
privileged access that they are getting

229
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,240
from Venezuela huge reserves it is

230
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,920
precisely for this reason that one of

231
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,990
President Juan Guido's objectives seems

232
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,850
to be to assure the Chinese that rather

233
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,420
happens the past agreements will be

234
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,610

237
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,110
Venezuela cooperation should not be

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,390
undermined gang strong foreign ministry

China in any case if you want to learn

241
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,270
more about this relationship do not miss

242
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,640
this video and finally we get to the

243
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,710
last Ally into what may be Nicolas

244
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,830

[Music]

246
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,839
first a spearhead against the West

247
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,339
nowadays Vladimir Putin's Russia is the

248
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,050
biggest international supporter that

249
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,250
Nicolas maduro's regime has in the last

250
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,930
two decades Russian companies have

251
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,089
secured important military contract and

252
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,579
since 2015 many rights to some of the

253
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,589
most significant oil and gas fields in

254
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,569
Venezuela and they have achieved all of

255
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:21,850
this at bargain prices what an example

256
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,720
well take a look at this

257
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:32,519
[Music]

258
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,680
in exchange for a desperate 1.5 billion

259
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,209
dollar rescue the Venezuelan government

260
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,380
to set 49.9% of its stake in Citgo PDVSA

261
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,180
s crown jewel and oil company that

262
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,860
operates in the United States where it

263
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,660
owns three refineries a huge gas

264
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,550
pipeline network and almost six thousand

265
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,980
service stations as warranty if PDVSA

266
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,140
doesn't pay the 1.5 billion dollars they

267
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,269
owe to Rosneft and Gazprom Venezuela

268
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,190
could be forced to sell what is today

269
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,680
its most valuable industrial asset at a

270
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,649
very low price all for just 1.5 billion

271
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:07,959
dollars and at this point we really have

272
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,660
to point out that 1.5 billion dollars

273
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,899
for half of Citgo is almost a joke with

274
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,120
that we can say well welcome to maduras

275
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,630
desperation sale

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,100
[Music]

277
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,600
the point is folks that Russia has

278
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,430
become the Venezuelan government's

279
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,260
number-one supplier of weapons military

280
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,779
equipments and instruments of repression

281
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,980
we seek a peaceful transition of power

282
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,470
but all options are own missiles tanks

283
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,570
planes in recent years the Bolivarian

284
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,339
government has spent a lot of money on

285
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,060
Russian equipment for Putin Venezuela

286
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,339
has meant a huge amount of business for

287
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,839
his military industry which is

288
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,970
incredibly important in Russia but also

289
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,769
now Putin sees it as an opportunity to

290
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,140
continue poking the West's eye while he

291
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,300
increases his control over some of the

292
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,110
planets and largest energy reserves

293
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,760
[Music]

294
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,620
anyway folks these are the four most

295
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,690
important allies on which Nicolas Maduro

296
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,360
is narco dictatorship still counts also

297
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,620
on the list would be countries like

298
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,750
Bolivia and Nicaragua and not a ruse but

299
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,430
they have a much smaller influence

300
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,290
globally as it stands the Bolivarian

301
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,880
governments will do anything it can to

302
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,370
secure Russia China and turkeys they

303
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,860
already have Cuba's full expressed and

304
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,930
firm support even if they have to sell

305
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,779
what little remains in Venezuela however

306
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,640
the political weakness and the chaos

307
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,050
that the scheffers government has

308
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,779
created is so extreme that this may no

309
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,130
longer be enough to bargain with

310
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,649
basically with this video we wanted to

311
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,870
better explain who continues to support

312
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,690
this trainwreck of a regime but now is

313
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,579
your turn do you think that Maduro will

314
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,829
manage to stay in power at least for

315
