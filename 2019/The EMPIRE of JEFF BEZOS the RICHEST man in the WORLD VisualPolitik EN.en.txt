37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,160
blank

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,870
Jeff who on the other hand if I say the

39
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,940
word Amazon then I have no doubt that

40
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,340

[Music]

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,400
well Jeff Bezos is none other than

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,320
Amazon's founder and is currently the

45
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,630
richest person on the planet we're

46
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,370

to Bloomberg hold on here hatea of more

48
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,410
than a hundred and ten billion dollars

49
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,060
although of course his recent divorce

50
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,290
wasn't cheap Jeff Bezos to give McKenzie

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,270
25% of his Amazon stake worth tens of

52
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,820
billions in divorce but just a second

53
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,740
its power Neth did the son of a Cuban

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,480
immigrants managed to become the richest

55
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400

[Music]

58
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,280
what basis is the perfect example of

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,349
what is popularly known as the American

60
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:18,969
Dream the popular belief that anyone

61
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,829
with a good idea and a lot of hard work

62
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,109
and reach the top in the USA well in

63
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,060
this video here on visual politic we

64
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,650
want to tell you all about the EM bar

65
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,900
that Bezos has managed to build so

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,310
listen up

67
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,870
[Music]

68
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,090
Big Ideas start in a garage

69
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,709
have you ever wondered what's up with

70
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:41,630
garages in the United States companies

71
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,819
like Apple Microsoft Google and Disney

72
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,580
all began their adventures in garages no

73
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,830
doubts we all need a garage maybe we at

74
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,540
visual politics should actually get one

75
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,310
an Amazon also began this way the garage

76
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,260
of the house that Jeff Bezos rented when

77
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,030
he moved near Seattle was where the

78
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,280
company began it was its first office

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,319
and distribution point all in that one

80
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,390
garage no doubt about it this was the

81
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,340
most profitable garage of all time but

82
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,650
well now how did that idea come about

83
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,100
why was Amazon creators well you see

84
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,530
back in 1994 Jeff Bezos worked at a

85
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,239
major Wall Street investment bank

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,890
eventually becoming vice presidents in

87
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,340
only eight years one day he came across

88
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,170
a report that said that the internet was

89
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,120
growing in users and size as a rate of

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,920
two thousand three hundred percent per

91
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
year and this is where the difference

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,280
between what we can call a regular

93
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,200
person and a visionary appeared upon

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,849
seeing that report Bezos knew that he

95
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,709
had to dive into the internet world he

96
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,480
simply couldn't miss out on all of that

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,160
growth Jeff thought that selling books

98
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,840
online could be a great idea something

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
that might seem obvious today but which

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,590
at the time was very risky at that time

101
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,910
the book mark is in the united states

102
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,010
was dominated by a group of large

103
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,069
bookstore chains

104
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,560
but mazes was going to pursue his idea

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,810
against store Lots I didn't think I'd

106
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,370
regret trying and failing and I

107
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,319
suspected I would always be haunted by a

108
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,700
decision to not try

109
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,560
I took the less safe path to follow my

110
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,090
passion and I'm proud of that choice

111
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,090
Jeff Bezos

112
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,220
and that's how it all started Bezos had

113
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,410
created the first online sales company

114
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,570
of course today we take online shopping

115
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,760
for granted but in 1994 things were very

116
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,060
different selling online was a

117
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,340
revolutionary and an almost crazy idea

118
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,810
very few people had access to the

119
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,790
Internet and even fewer knew that you

120
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,320
could buy all kinds of things through

121
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,240
this new technology things such as books

122
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,650
but hold on a second because there's

123
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,330
something even more complicated he had

124
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,250
to face the two big problems that every

125
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,470
entrepreneur faces one how to make a

126
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,960
completely new idea a success and two

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,760
how to get financing to carry out your

128
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,979
plans he needed to be persuasive

129
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,780
that's why Jeff Bezos his own parents

130
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,630
lens in $300,000 from their pension

131
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,550
funds n Bezos and four more workers

132
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,199
began selling and distributing books

133
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,789
from his garage they worked in many

134
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:10,820
cases 15 hours a day

135
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,920
Bezos himself took the books to the post

136
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,450
office to make the shipments getting

137
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,620
started it was heart

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,360
however within a single month this

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,580
company had already sold books in all 50

140
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,260
states that make up the United States

141
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,960
and in 45 overseas countries as well Ian

142
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,559
voiced around $20,000 per week

143
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,469
that's how in 2007 after just 13 years

144
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:35,139
in business Amazon already had 614

145
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,699
workers of course that was just the

146
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,559
beginning by 2018 that figures

147
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,830
skyrocketed to almost 650,000 workers

148
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:50,150
[Music]

149
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,340
this company conceived in a regular old

150
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,740
garage now employs hundreds of thousands

151
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,260
of people and covers 49% of all online

152
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,630
sales in the United States so they must

153
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,729
have done things very very well wouldn't

154
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,710
you think but well how far to Jeff Bezos

155
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,020
his tentacles reach I'll listen up our

156
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,430
failures have to grow with the company

157
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,470
we need big failures if we're gonna be

158
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,270
moving the needle we need to have you

159
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,460
know billion-dollar scale failures and

160
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,860
if we're not we're not swinging

161
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,500
we're not swinging hard enough business

162
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,199
growth and diversification as a guiding

163
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,270
light if there's one thing that Jeff

164
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,160
Bezos likes it's new projects new

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,350
challenges and above all a concept and

166
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,300
that's growth and grow is exactly what

167
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,690
he did

168
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,160
taking advantage of the resources that

169
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,650
Amazon's successes provided Bezos has

170
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,360
built one of the largest investment

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,100
portfolios in the world from technology

172
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,510
companies to the transport sector

173
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,550
through to robotics or medicine nothing

174
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,180
escapes in its space OSes empire in

175
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,889
addition to its personal investment

176
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,479
spaces created a venture capital firm

177
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,550
called Bezos expeditions to manage his

178
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,229
investments these types of investment

179
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:53,240
instruments specialize in startups that

180
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,919
is they provide financing to fledgling

181
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,330
companies companies with a good idea

182
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,220
that who need money to grow and achieve

183
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,860
their goals

184
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,020
so which startups specifically has Bezos

185
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,880
expeditions put its money behind well

186
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,860
surely the most familiar is Twitter the

187
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,270
company which received fifteen million

188
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,099
dollars in 2008 when it was still just

189
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,260
starting out that's not all much of

190
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,849
their investments have gone to the field

191
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,680
of robotics especially to rethink

192
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,630
robotics a company which received cash

193
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,580
injections seven times in four years

194
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,590
from Bezos expeditions although in this

195
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,090
case the company ended up holding and

196
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,949
I'll not everything can be a success but

197
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,360
if there's one thing that catches our

198
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,870
attention

199
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,880
it's how Bezos expeditions have changed

200
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,919
their investments over time Briggs on

201
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,419
bought their first investments were very

202
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:36,889
much directed towards the world of

203
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,050
technology the Internet's and robots but

204
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,820
over time they've evolved in the fields

205
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,949
such as online education bio pharmacy

206
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,169
and biotechnology and have even invested

207
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,669
in a vertical farming company actually

208
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,070
this is Bezos expeditions is largest

209
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,050
investment totaling two hundred million

210
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,780
dollars

211
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,160
but if this already sounds amazing what

212
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,930
we're gonna tell you next is even more

213
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,730
so because Jeff Bezos has already made

214
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,280
significant personal investments in 1998

215
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,450
he became one of Google's first

216
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,420
investors yet he invested $250,000 when

217
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,010
Google was little more than a project

218
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,510
can you imagine what that quarter of a

219
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:16,140
million dollars is worth today just with

220
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,060
that investment even forgetting Amazon

221
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,930
and everything else

222
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,240
Bezos would be a billionaire

223
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,560
the fact is that among his personal

224
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,090
investments in many well-known companies

225
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,190
such as uber and airbnb that he bags

226
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,630
when they were just starting out the guy

227
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,550
certainly has an incredible eye for

228
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,910
investment and it doesn't end there

229
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,530
don't think for a moment that Bezos

230
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,060
doesn't have time for philanthropy in

231
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,160
2018 he announced the creation of a

232
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,020
solidarity fund of two billion dollars

233
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,920
to finance education for the poor but

234
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,870
this still isn't the end of our story

235
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,060
in 2013 mezzo sport one of the most

236
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,860
influential newspapers in the world the

237
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,020
Washington Post why well far from what

238
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,490
you might think it wasn't to influence

239
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,560
the press or politics in fact first

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,060
Bezos didn't want to enter the media

241
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,950
business at all I have respect for Jeff

242
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,380
Bezos but he bought the Washington Post

243
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,770
to have political influence and I get it

244
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,600
tells you we have a different country

245
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
than we used to have we have a different

246
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,400
he owns Amazon he wants political

247
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,850
influence so that Amazon will benefit

248
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,250
from it that's not right

249
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,900
he had to be convinced by Donald Graham

250
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,150
himself the former CEO of the Washington

251
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,980
Post and a member of a family that has

252
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,020
owned the newspaper for 80 years screen

253
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,520
thought that Bezos had everything

254
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,230
required to lead the newspapers

255
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,210
transition from the paper to the digital

256
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,770
era and without that transition

257
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,390
bankruptcy was only going to be a matter

258
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,130
of time in the end he managed to

259
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,740
convince him and yes once again bezos's

260
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,330
investment seems to have been a success

261
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,400
since the founder of Amazon arrived the

262
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,720
Washington Post has increased its

263
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
workforce by more than 200 journalists

264
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,410
it has fully entered business journalism

265
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,330
it has more than one and a half million

266
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,070
digital subscribers and has run at a

267
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,820
profit for the last three years when I'm

268
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,680
90 it's going to be one of the things

269
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,660
I'm most proud of that I took on the

270
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,280
Washington Post and helped them through

271
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,890
a very rough transition Jeff Bezos but

272
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,270
the funny thing with Bezos is that we

273
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,160
can be talking about a newspaper as much

274
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,990
as we could be talking about space in

275
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,180
2000 Bezos founded Blue Origin an

276
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,530
aerospace transport company Blue Origin

277
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,450
is an aerospace company that aims to

278
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,370
facilitate human beings private access

279
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,500
to space here's more than 2000 employees

280
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,420
and hopes to be able to send tourists to

281
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,660
space by no later than this year 2019

282
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,660
but the most curious thing of all is the

283
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,390
reason why it was born deaf buzos I

284
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,550
spend my billions on space because we're

285
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,770
destroying earth and what's more the

286
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,180
thing about billions is literal

287
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,680
Blue Origin has become bayes's his

288
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,630
greatest adventure and see finances the

289
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,640
project by cashing in his own amazon

290
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,560
shares at a rate of 1 billion dollars

291
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,589
per year

292
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,940
but speaking of Amazon phases as

293
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,100
tentacles don't stop exclusively at his

294
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,050
personal investments he still Amazon's

295
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,610
largest shareholder one of the 10

296
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,320
largest companies on the entire planet

297
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,899
and the question we can ask ourselves is

298
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,390
this how far do bezos's adventures go

299
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:19,740
via Amazon Amazon an empire within the

300
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,560
Empire ok so far we've talked about

301
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,690
Bezos in his venture capital but this

302
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,670
online distribution giant also makes

303
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,260
significant investments and has bought a

304
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,970
lot of companies outright it's got to

305
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,589
the point that today Amazon isn't just a

306
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:33,330
commercial distribution company in fact

307
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,339
not at all cloud services movies music

308
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,200
Amazon is covering more and more

309
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,860
activities every day throughout the

310
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,839
years Amazon has bought companies of all

311
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,940
kinds some well-known examples are the

312
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,709
acquisition of Alexa Internet and

313
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,959
analytics web company Kiva systems which

314
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,940
develops robotic automatic warehouses

315
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,800
and is now called Amazon robotics or

316
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,930
twitch a famous game streaming platform

317
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,399
for gamers however its biggest

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,470
acquisition to date worth more than 13

319
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,000
billion dollars has been the u.s.

320
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,829
supermarket chain Whole Foods which

321
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,570
Amazon wants to compete against Walmart

322
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,459
and Costco worth taking advantage of its

323
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,560
online distribution experience but the

324
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,089
question that many people ask about

325
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,579
Amazon is could this huge Empire pose a

326
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,529
problem for small businesses at first

327
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,180
glance the answer seems to be a

328
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,120
resounding yes we're looking at a Giants

329
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,890
that is getting increasingly involved in

330
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,600
more and more sectors and this Giants

331
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,070
has stormed into the commercial

332
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,600
distribution business like a true

333
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,490
hurricane that just hold on a second

334
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,050
because there are some important details

335
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,970
that some people usually don't think

336
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,310
about

337
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,000
[Music]

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,610
last year in 2018 a 58% of everything

339
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,440
that was sold on Amazon were products by

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,180
third party companies who took advantage

341
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,310
rama sons huge sales platform to reach

342
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,290
millions of customers fewer and fewer

343
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,210
products are being sold by Amazon itself

344
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,770
and more are being sold through their

345
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,840
website by third party suppliers and

346
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,370
it's not just physical goods the company

347
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,050
is also allowing many writers musicians

348
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,240
and audio-visual content creators to

349
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,530
release their work for sale on the

350
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,610
platform therefore it would be sensible

351
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,170
to think that Amazon itself isn't

352
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,030
destroyed businesses that forcing them

353
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:13,180
to transform Jeff Bezos he was a pioneer

354
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,100
in online commerce and over time his

355
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,810
idea and that of the thousands and

356
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,400
thousands of companies that accompanied

357
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,260
him along the way have changed the way

358
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,760
that we shop and the way that we live

359
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,260
and that's exactly what he's trying to

360
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,030
do right now with a lot of different

361
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,410
businesses from the media to the

362
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,900
aerospace industry Jeff Bezos may not be

363
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,910
an extremely well-known character but in

364
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,170
one way or another

365
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,600
his actions having a huge impact on all

366
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,520
of our lives with this video we not only

367
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,170
wanted to make him better known but we

368
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,000
also wanted to show you how sometimes a

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,710
person's success ends up translating

370
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,960
into a huge benefit for everyone because

371
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,790
the reason Amazon has been so successful
