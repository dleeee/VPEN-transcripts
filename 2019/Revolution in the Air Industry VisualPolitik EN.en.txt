3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,190
after 9/11 the world of aviation changed

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,620
forever nowadays things seem to be about

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,910
change once again

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,220
[Music]

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,530
in this era of globalization where

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,550
everything is becoming increasingly

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,220
connected who hasn't been on a plane the

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,990
fact that flying is relatively common in

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,250
most countries of the world these days

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,320
is kind of an extraordinary feat it's

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,850
actually much more extraordinary than

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,230
you could imagine don't believe this

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,610
well check out the following data in the

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,250
middle of the 20th century in 1950 31

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,900
million passengers travelled the world

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,120
by air back then flying was a luxury

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,980
that only a few people could afford by

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,890
1986 that number had increased to 960

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,720
million passengers pretty incredible

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,890
right what if I told you that last year

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,170
in 2018 a whopping four point four

24
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,089
billion passengers were transported by

25
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:04,650
air on 38 million flights

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,030
American Airlines alone the largest

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,650
airline in the world transported almost

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,460
200 million people in its 6,500 daily

29
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,080
flights in 2018 it's crazy

30
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,140
[Music]

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,880
Aviation is so essential today that one

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,159
couldn't imagine a world without it now

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,049
times change and aviation has also

34
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,000
changed and some of the questions we can

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,039
consider these how are the airlines

36
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,689
business models changing the how will

37
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,729
this sector evolve in the future and how

38
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:39,959
will that affect us well listen up

39
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,130
different models for different times

40
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,179
traditionally folks the big airlines of

41
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:48,640
the world concentrated their operations

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,369
in one or very few airports from these

43
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,869
bases they offered long all destinations

44
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,610
that way passengers coming from domestic

45
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,649
flights cooled feeders spent transit

46
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,149
time in these airports before then

47
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:03,369
traveling abroad often wasting a lot of

48
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:04,899
time at the airport I'm sure you've

49
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:06,909
experienced this annoyance this model is

50
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,920
known as hub-and-spoke though we will

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,330
call it the central hub model

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,200
[Music]

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,720
this model based on giant airports has

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,180
made sense for many years why well

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,099
because it facilitated long-haul routes

56
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,140
which were operated with huge airplanes

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,270
airplanes that needed to transport many

58
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,200
passengers to be profitable these were

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,540
called dense routes Airlines needed

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,709
passengers to come from different

61
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,470
origins and converge in the hub so that

62
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,670
they could later put them all together

63
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,470
on a single flight to take them to their

64
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,140
final destination it's pretty logical

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,890
[Music]

66
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,360
and not only that the sector was also

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,340
affected by huge regulations for example

68
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,440
in the United States all routes between

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,450
states were considered to be of public

70
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,459
utility and in most cases the government

71
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,410
itself was in charge of setting prices

72
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,269
programming frequencies and even

73
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,019
proposing or rejecting new routes so

74
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,700
every time an airline wanted to open a

75
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,110
new route it had to get the state's

76
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,970
approval sometimes years would pass

77
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,860
before they managed to approve new

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,989
routes and they often let too long legal

79
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,580
battles

80
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,550
but folks all this changed up once with

81
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,800
the airlines deregulation law which was

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,480
approved in 1978 this law introduced

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,370
free competition and gave airlines a lot

84
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,170
of reiden to operate based on their own

85
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,830
market criteria it was precisely this

86
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,600
change within a very short time that led

87
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,310
to a new business model that Southwest

88
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,200
Airlines managed to exploit to the

89
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,240
fullest and that was the birth of the

90
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,540
low-cost model

91
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,840
in contrast air industry deregulation

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,849
arrived in Europe much later competition

93
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,560
between Airlines it wasn't allowed until

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,890
1993 nonetheless it saw such huge

95
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,290
success that in just four years by 1997

96
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,329
the entire process was completed

97
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,250
nowadays markets in the United States

98
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,200
and Europe quite difference perhaps due

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
to their evolutions in the United States

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,950
the variety of destinations the numbers

101
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,989
of users and above all the weight of

102
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:08,489
their regional routes make it the

103
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,550
largest air market on the planet

104
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,950
[Music]

105
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,720
low cost companies such as Southwest or

106
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,730
JetBlue offer a huge variety of

107
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,650
point-to-point destinations that is the

108
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,600
passenger travels from their origin to

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
their destination without having to stop

110
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,020
at an intermediate airport and you know

111
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,940
what I can already tell you that this

112
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,250
model is the future in Europe on the

113
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,810
other hand though they are moving out

114
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,910
with huge strides the sector is still

115
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,770
less developed than in the United States

116
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,270
as many small airlines coexist in

117
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,680
addition Regional Transport isn't so

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,150
important largely thanks to the

119
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,680
excellent railway connections the

120
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,080
Achilles heel of the United States and

121
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,580
that's another topic we certainly have

122
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,230
to talk about here on visual politics

123
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,120
some day but not today but folks the big

124
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,700
question is where is the future of

125
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,180
aviation going

126
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,919
well everything indicates that the

127
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,840
market is inclined to offer more and

128
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,789
more direct routes that is routes

129
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,800
without stopping the major airports and

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,729
this explains news headlines like this

131
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,190
a380 Airbus to stop making super jumbo

132
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:26,240
as orders dry up you see the fact is

133
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,590
that thanks to the evolution of

134
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,270
airplanes which are much more efficient

135
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,830
and cheaper than before longer flights

136
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,810
can be operated by smaller airplanes at

137
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,180
a lower price this is called a thin

138
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,370
route and it is shaping the future of

139
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,320
aviation we're talking about a huge

140
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,270
paradigm shift here under this concept

141
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,340
the big airport hubs of the world could

142
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,740
suffer a great deal

143
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,669
[Music]

144
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,830
and that's not all let's consider the

145
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,900
two largest aeronautical manufacturers

146
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,710
in the world

147
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,300
Boeing and Airbus have taken the race to

148
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,189
lead the new revolution in the sector

149
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,319
very seriously for example a few years

150
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,150
ago the American Boeing released the

151
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,729
Boeing 787 which promised an efficiency

152
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:09,389
never seen before in aviation that was

153
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,430
until the Airbus a350 arrived a

154
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,439
groundbreaking aircraft combination of

155
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,909
the best European technology the

156
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,830
lightest and most sustainable materials

157
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,659
and the most efficient engines on the

158
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,379
market in this battle to leave the new

159
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:24,330
aviation revolution competition is

160
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,340
fierce so fierce in fact that some

161
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,719
companies are having to make great

162
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:35,300
efforts to adapt to the new times

163
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,080
Emirates and the end of the a380 who has

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,089
in terms of Emirates and it's gigantic

165
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,879
a380 with luxury suites showers and

166
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,589
on-board shops we're talking about one

167
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,240
of the most luxurious and reputable

168
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,490
airlines in the world here but the

169
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,560
company based in Dubai is about to

170
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,180
launch the biggest change in its history

171
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,740
see Emirates is the most radical example

172
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,930
of the over-exploitation of the old

173
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,240
traditional hub centered model virtually

174
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,279
all of its passengers pass through Dubai

175
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,439
either as their final destination or to

176
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,930
make a stopover on one of its 3,600

177
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,270
weekly flights to 138 destinations

178
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,990
around the world in addition every one

179
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,800
of its aircrafts is huge its fleet was

180
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,899
based solely on the Boeing triple7 and

181
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,080
110 mammoth Airbus a380s the largest

182
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,669
passenger plane in the world in fact

183
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,649
Emirates has the largest fleet of this

184
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:37,059
model on the planet and actually without

185
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,189
Emirates as a customer the a380 program

186
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,129
would simply be unsustainable the future

187
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,680
of the Airbus a380 on the line as

188
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,460
Emirates considers a 350 switch if a

189
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,199
significant portion of the Emirates

190
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,899
orders cancelled we believe the a380

191
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,669
program must end

192
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,309
sandy Morris analyst at Jefferies

193
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,319
International this may be the clearest

194
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,029
sign that the aviation sector is

195
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,339
beginning to undergo a revolution think

196
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:04,539
about it for a minute the fact that

197
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,610
Emirates itself owned by the emirate of

198
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,259
Dubai is thinking about no longer

199
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,479
relying exclusively on do buyers a hub

200
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,759
pretty significance equally significant

201
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,379
is the decisions you no longer continue

202
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,689
to acquire the a380 the company's

203
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:19,870
flagship airline Emirates rethinks its

204
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,259
network for a world without the a380 we

205
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,059
haven't been growing at the pace we used

206
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:27,039
to because of geopolitical issues in the

207
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,809
region and elsewhere but that's given us

208
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,789
time to take stock of what the network

209
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,680
is going to look like in five to ten

210
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,899
years and what fleet will fit in that

211
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,029
Network and the type of aircraft that

212
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,130
it's going to be tim clark president of

[Music]

215
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,850
by the way another question we could ask

216
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,770
ourselves is how would this paradigm

217
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,170
shift affect Dubai a city that as you

218
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,700
know isn't enjoying the best of times

219
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,490
right now

220
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,200
the thing is that airplanes like the

221
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,320
Boeing triple7 X the a330 neo into the

222
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,020
a350 have become the new stars of the

223
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,600
market these three new models boast much

224
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,370
more efficient performance which allows

225
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,230
them to operate on less dense routes

226
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,030
with a greater profit margin thus this

227
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,680
makes the hub's obsolete of course

228
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,330
changing times brings the most

229
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,340
opportunities for new competitors in

230
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,330
this game there are companies doing

231
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,130
things differently and that is allowing

232
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,860
them to have huge success so listen up

233
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,089
[Music]

234
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,389
airasia

235
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,290
the success of the low-cost hybrid one

236
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,790
of the greatest examples of recent

237
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,829
success has its origins in none other

238
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,950
than Malaysia AirAsia is a low-cost

239
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,170
company with more than 250 aircrafts and

240
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,970
it transported almost 45 million

241
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,550
passengers in 2018 it's hybrid strategy

242
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,380
a mix of both the central hub and

243
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,850
point-to-point model has made it the

244
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,339
continents largest low-cost airline in

245
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:09,690
just over 20 years their secret a model

246
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,820
based on low-cost subsidiaries in which

247
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,889
each subsidiary has several operations

248
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,779
centers these are sort of like micro

249
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,000
hubs or small domestic hubs that way

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,070
AirAsia manages to take advantage of the

251
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,750
high-density population and the huge

252
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,820
number of tourist areas that exist in

253
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,410
this part of the world now with its

254
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,260
affiliate AirAsia X its new big bet it's

255
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,089
trying to go a step further you see

256
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,160
AirAsia X is its long distance

257
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,959
subsidiary its objective to operate

258
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,910
long-haul flights from these domestic

259
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,750
hubs

260
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,209
thanks to new aircraft such as the a330

261
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:42,889
near this company we'll be able to offer

262
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,720
attractive prices without needing a

263
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,850
large passenger demand in Europe perhaps

264
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,439
the closest thing to this model is

265
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,569
Norwegian of course on the old continent

266
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:52,100
we have our own way of doing things and

267
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,319
we have a world-renowned company that is

268
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,970
often talked about that has forever

269
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:03,900
transforms the European aviation market

270
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,120
Ryanair the democratization of air

271
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,710
transport in Europe

272
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,990
can you imagine Europe without the

273
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,910
possibility of escaping for a weekend to

274
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,800
visit the city you dreamed of when you

275
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,630
were a child well today it seems hard to

276
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,880
believe but that was Europe not so long

277
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,120
ago the low-cost airline model that was

278
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,770
born from the deregulation of the

279
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,990
aviation market hasn't only changed the

280
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,030
industry but also the lives of all

281
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,520
Europeans we've already talked about

282
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,590
this here previously on visual politic

283
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,780
Ryanair began its journey in 1985 with

284
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,630
25 workers and a single 15 seat plane

285
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,280
flying the route between Waterford

286
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,700
southeast Ireland and London Gatwick now

287
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,980
the company has grown into a giant with

288
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,130
more than 400 aircraft that fly to 225

289
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,500
destinations in 35 countries and that is

290
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,430
certainly no small achievement their

291
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,320
success looking at Southwest and

292
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,180
importing the low-cost model to Europe

293
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,590
for the very first time the model that

294
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,600
is based on sacrificing services in

295
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,700
exchange for paying less and flying from

296
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,950
origin to destination in a single flight

297
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,660
that is from point to point

298
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,130
thanks to this millions of people who

299
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,870
previously couldn't travel within Europe

300
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,270
now do so frequently on this or another

301
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,520
of the many low-cost European companies

302
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,200
that have sprung up in the last decade

303
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,180
or so this has definitely been a huge

304
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,520
advantage in European integration even

305
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,230
traditional companies have had to adapt

306
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,420
to compete creating reduced rates with

307
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,800
fewer services in Europe this model has

308
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,080
grown exponentially in 2018 more than

309
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,480
500 million low-cost seats were offered

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,490
which is a historic record and although

311
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,500
it many anticipated the ends of

312
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,240
traditional aviation the truth is that

313
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,220
the opposite is actually happens there

314
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,930
has been a democratization of the

315
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,460
markets because the prices of the big

316
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,260
flag companies have drops to be able to

317
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,110
compete in a changing market annoucer

318
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,180
accessible to many more people

319
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,770
but the question is can all these

320
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,390
changes completely eliminate the

321
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,270
centralized large hub model well that is

322
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,010
gonna be really complicated even though

323
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,900
the traditional hub model is no longer

324
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,730
as important as it used to be then dis

325
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,560
likely to decline the big traditional

326
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,600
companies have enormous structures that

327
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,100
are linked to this model which they

328
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,500
won't be able to change easily right now

329
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,060
it seems unfeasible to think that the

330
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,710
point-to-point model will impose itself

331
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,450
on long-haul flight routes in the short

332
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,490
and medium term but of course that

333
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,350
doesn't mean that many airlines and many

334
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,750
large hubs such as Dubai won't start

335
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,550
having problems in fact there are many

336
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,560
indications that they will hear a visual

337
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,910
politic we're going to be keeping an eye

338
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,130
on all of these changes so I really hope
