now let's get on with it shall we

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,690
dubai is very different place from any

14
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,250
other place in the Persian Gulf its

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,649
economy isn't based on oil on natural

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,750
gas or any other raw material but

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,180
instead mainly on tourism transport

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,710
trade and finance

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,300
but despite not being rich in natural

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,339
resources in the last four decades Dubai

21
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:55,500
became one of the most prosperous cities

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,820
in history

23
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,309
since the first towers began to emerge

24
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,380
in the deserts this city's growth has

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,780
been non-stop the tallest building in

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,580
the world the largest shopping mall the

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,130
largest airport the most luxurious hotel

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,290
you can find everything here and we

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,540
could say that this city is made by and

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,790
for money everything absolutely

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,000
everything in this Enclave is shaped by

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,880
the money flowing into and out of it

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,190
however 2018 hasn't exactly been the

34
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,610
Emirates happiest yeah in the last 12

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,080
months the Dubai stock market has

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,350
plummeted by almost 25 percent new

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,660
business licenses have decreased and for

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,970
the first time ever employment has also

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,630
fallen look we have to we have to plan

40
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,829
for the worst

41
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,750
today more and more analysts are

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,310
wondering whether Dubai is about to

43
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,750
undergo a huge crisis and this precisely

44
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,850
is the main question today and that's is

45
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,420
Dubai and losing its shine well listen

46
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:11,580
up

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,500
signs and shadows while much of the Arab

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,030
world is facing a great deal of chaos

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,950
economic crises political crises

50
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,500
violence Dubai is very busy developing

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,570
3d printers theme parks air taxi

52
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,790
services and even working to send a

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,190
probe to Mars within just three years

54
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,440
but as I was saying 2018 there hasn't

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,240
been a very good year look even though

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,520
more than 90% of Dubai's population is

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,530
foreign schools for expatriates are

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,750
closing or losing students and moving

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,060
companies are showing one clear trend

60
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,070
more people are leaving than arriving

61
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,320
and although the construction pace is

62
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,730
still in full swing it's becoming

63
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,620
increasingly clear that many of these

64
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,520
new buildings are half empty apartments

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,930
offices hotels shopping centers

66
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,120
obtaining official statistics it's not

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,860
easy but what happens when this more

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,350
supply than there is demand swell prices

69
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,080
drop and that's exactly what is

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,550
happening

71
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,360
[Music]

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,730
and not only that in our property stocks

73
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,590
the company that built the Burj Kalifa

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,180
and those of lots of other large

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,950
developers listed on the device stock

76
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,750
exchange have suffered a collapse of

77
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,510
almost 40 percent in the last year and

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,560
known what more well dxb entertainments

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,090
the company that owns most of the theme

80
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,470
parks that have opened in Dubai in

81
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,870
recent years such as Legoland by motion

82
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,910
gate and Bollywood Park is negotiating

83
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,950
with banks to restructure more than 1

84
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,720
billion dollars in debt

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,700
simply because the number of visitors is

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,280
much shallower than expected so you can

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,390
probably see now that it's not exactly

88
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,060
time to celebrate and so the question we

89
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,650
can now ask ourselves here on visual

90
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,890
politic is well what the is happening we

91
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,050
got to ask why is divide facing this

92
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,180
possible crisis and is this the end of

93
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,680
the Emirates that has broken every

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
middle-eastern moles well let's see

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,930
[Music]

96
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,110
the store

97
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,359
davai is facing a completely new

98
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,640
scenario in this case the origin of the

99
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,250
problem made lie far beyond its rulers

100
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,760
competence allow me to explain Dubai is

101
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,830
perhaps the most famous emirate in the

102
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,290
United Arab Emirates but it's Abu Dhabi

103
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,150
that has the oil the money and the power

104
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,130
in fact even though Sheikh Mohammed bin

105
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,980
Rashid governs Dubai it's this man here

106
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,350
Mohammed bin Zayed the crown prince of

107
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,140
Abu Dhabi who de facto rules all the

108
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,980
United Arab Emirates well the key to

109
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,990
devise huge success was becoming

110
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,030
something like the Switzerland of the

111
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,860
Middle East the freest space the most

112
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,440
legally secure and the most open to the

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,540
rest of the planet and of course yes

114
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,669
they absolutely had low taxes however

115
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,770
now some of these things starting to be

116
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,770
questioned

117
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,599
in the last two to three years the

118
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:07,400
United Arab Emirates government has

119
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,949
adopted a very active foreign policy

120
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,990
Prince Mohammed bin Zayed has completely

121
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,849
aligned himself with Saudi Prince

122
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,190
Mohammed bin Salman specifically on two

123
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,830
fronts qatar and iran check this out on

124
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,720
the one hand both countries have led the

125
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,610
blockade against qatar a country that

126
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,130
has very close ties with dubai in fact

127
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,840
many international companies settled in

128
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,880
dubai and their executives traveled to

129
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,949
and from doha and jebel ali devised

130
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,930
great port was also Qatar's most

131
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,860
important supply center now while that's

132
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,659
all over with the blockade to the UAE

133
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,789
ordered all Qatari citizens to leave the

134
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:45,680
country most flights were suspended and

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,509
freight traffic was interrupted now

136
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,000
Qatar is directly provisioned by or

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,220
through a man but no longer through

138
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,300
Jebel Ali with the blockade Dubai has

139
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,669
lost a very important commercial partner

140
00:05:58,669 --> 00:05:59,870
in addition to all of this many

141
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,490
companies and investors have noticed

142
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,319
that legal security and maneuverability

143
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,819
weren't as strong as they previously

144
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,740
thought because as you can see Dubai

145
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,960
ultimately depends on decisions made in

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,270
Abu Dhabi but that's not all

147
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:18,110
[Music]

148
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,000
you may also has very important

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,130
relations with Iran in fact thanks to

150
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,230
its proximity Dubai became something of

151
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,240
an escape route a place for many Iranian

152
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,070
leaders and entrepreneurs to stay for a

153
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,140
few days have some fun and spend some

154
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,330
money and not only that every year their

155
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,920
commercial business transactions with

156
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,990
Iran surpassed twenty billion dollars

157
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,910
but now because of US sanctions and the

158
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,410
growing diplomatic conflicts between

159
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,210
your yard and Tehran this trade is

160
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,550
shrinking by leaps and bounds the ships

161
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,290
that used to send Goods every week and

162
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,400
now go once a month in other words in

163
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,350
just over a year Dubai has lost two of

164
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,360
its largest trading partners due to

165
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,700
decisions made in Abu Dhabi and do you

166
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,400
think that's all well it's absolutely

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,350
not just as dy became sort of a

168
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,330
playground and second safe zone for

169
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,830
Iranians the same thing happens with

170
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,260
Saudi citizens and businessmen of course

171
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,640
given all the restrictions that Saudi

172
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,070
Arabia has for the Saudis Dubai is an

173
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,620
oasis of freedom and safety well when

174
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,240
the Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman

175
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,490
unleashed his war against corruption nor

176
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,440
a move to consolidate his power rather

177
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,630
and locked up or kidnapped dozens of

178
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,160
Saudi businessman and senior officials

179
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,200
the Arab Emirates Central Bank demanded

180
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,630
all banks operating in the country to

181
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,460
give Riyadh all the information they had

182
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,710
on the detainees accounts and they

183
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,360
delivered all this information even when

184
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,910
they hadn't been charged information of

185
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,010
course we ant used to get the money from

186
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,540
all those businessmen who then had to

187
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,719
buy their freedom with their checkbooks

188
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,949
that way the Saudi businessman who

189
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,599
thought that Dubai was the true

190
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,460
Switzerland of the Middle East realized

191
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,639
that this wasn't really the case yes in

192
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,590
Dubai there's legal security and your

193
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,300
savings are safe but not the information

194
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,979
with which the autocratic Saudi

195
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,909
government can extort you so probably

196
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,349
beginning to see where the problem is

197
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,300
well due to these reasons and others the

198
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,249
Dubai financial industry is also

199
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,960
suffering but oh no we haven't yet

200
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,029
reached the end of this list the

201
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,650
headaches they don't simply stop here

202
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,120
the dropping oil prices in recent years

203
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,680
have affected the purchasing power of

204
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
many of the people who spend their money

205
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,909
in Dubai a lower oil price means less

206
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,770
income and that as we've seen her and

207
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,090
visual politic has meant that some

208
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,099
countries like Saudi Arabia have to make

209
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,750
many many cuts and finally there's

210
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,399
another factor that depends on Dubai

211
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,349
itself in a certain way the city runs

212
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,180
the risk of becoming a victim of its own

213
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,890
success and yes you heard that right

214
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,870
thanks to demise huge success its prices

215
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,120
of skyrocketed especially when it comes

216
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,280
to real estate and yet Dubai does have

217
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,260
very low taxes but the stay gets many

218
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,540
resources through building licenses you

219
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,430
which hasn't helped either if do all of

220
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,990
this we had the fact that many Middle

221
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,520
Eastern countries to reduce their

222
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,170
dependence on oil have launched plans to

223
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,820
copy this city by giving many advantages

224
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,620
to their investors the result is that

225
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,480
Dubai has lost its appeal to

226
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,970
international companies in recent years

227
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,430
anyway as you now see these are the

228
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,290
roots of the problem Abu Dhabi Qatar

229
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,570
Iran and the cost of its own success

230
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,490
they've all decreased this emirate

231
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,190
cities attractive Oasis status but what

232
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,560
many of you might be wondering is well

233
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,610
what now so listen up

[Music]

237
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,860
even though its economy is expected to

238
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,860
grow by just over 2% in 2019 as you can

239
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,110
see Dubai isn't going through the best

240
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,790
of times but hold on a second because

241
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,190
this doesn't mean everything's lost not

242
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,730
at all in spite of everything this city

243
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,830
emirate continues to be an oasis in the

244
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,540
desert and its government seems to have

245
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,970
a clear idea of the keys to its success

246
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,350
therefore what sheikh mohammed bin

247
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,300
rashid x' government is doing now is

248
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,220
trying to make Dubai's economy even more

249
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,230
competitive with its neighbors do so

250
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,150
that making it easier to obtain a visa

251
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,950
they're ensuring that expatriates who

252
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,300
lose their jobs have an easier time

253
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,040
staying ins they're decreasing the

254
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,690
obstacles of foreign business owners

255
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,280
outside of the special economic zones in

256
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,840
other words they want to connect dubai

257
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,180
even more with the rest of the world in

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,890
fact local authorities have high hopes

259
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,830
for the arrival of Chinese investors

260
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,390
this is a market cycle that we have to

261
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,220
accept the government is doing what it

262
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,170
did in past slumps sitting down with

263
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,970

Emirates NBD folks this is what is

271
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,040
happening in this city stage this has

272
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,050
had such a positive impact on the Middle

273
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,390
East yes in Dubai a lot of unfortunate

274
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,640
things may be reported opening up to the

275
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,530
world has been a breath of fresh air for

276
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,660
one of the most hostile areas on the

277
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,880
planet in terms of human rights in Dubai

278
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,190
not only can you drink alcohol eat pork

279
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,170

only the future will be able to tell if

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,050
this city-states frenetic growth pace

286
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,540
will continue or if instead to Dubai is

287
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,180
doomed to suffer a huge crisis and lose

288
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,840
its shine so far the party continues a

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,820
Dubai company would build the largest

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,490

291
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,260
hope you enjoyed that video and as I

292
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,520
said at the beginning this one was made

293
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,530
possible by blinkers now do you manage

294
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,210
to read all the books you want you

295
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,950
managed to get all of that knowledge in

296
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,360
your hair's probably not right I mean

297
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,170
everyone see

298
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,420
busier than ever it seems like there's

299
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,860
hardly time to spend learning it's much

300
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,120
easier just to click on that other

301
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,160
tempting video over there on the right

302
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,050
about some nonsense or other now you

303
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,070
might not think that you have a ton of

304
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,720
time to read but the good news is that

305
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,910
even if you don't you can use blinkers

306
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,200
blinkers there's an app that takes the

307
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,279
best insights and need-to-know

308
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,079
information from thousands of

309
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,820
non-fiction books and condenses them

310
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,410
into fifteen minutes which you can

311
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,180
either read or listen to they've got a

312
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,130
huge library and eight million users I

313
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,329
think I'm actually probably the ideal

314
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:20,399
Linkous customer I spend a lot of time

315
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,380
working and far less time learning than

316
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,180
I should and I often play into the audio

317
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,829
versions and listen to them while I'm

318
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,810
like unloading the dishwasher and boring

319
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,519
tasks like that listen they've got tons

320
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,959
of popular titles like the 4-hour

321
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,730
workweek from Tim Ferriss but they've

322
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,139
also got stuff you guys probably really

323
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,940
be into lots of political stuff and you

324
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,290
know like I often see on this channel

325
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,730
let's take a look back at the history

326
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,470
they've got books condensed like the

327
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,720
Silk Roads by Peter Frank a man the

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,190
