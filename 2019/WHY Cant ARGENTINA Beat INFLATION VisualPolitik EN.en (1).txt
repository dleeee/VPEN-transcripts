no cream on no me more um capping shame

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,500
of the kingdom Argentina is one of the

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,790
few countries in the world that is

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,800
undergoing chronic inflation inflation

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,690
that they just can't get rid of when you

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,760
look at the statistics it leaves you

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,539
speechless

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,950
the country has experienced high

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,989
inflationary processes for at least the

15
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,809
last five decades fifty years in fact

16
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,730
since the Central Bank of Argentina was

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,949
created in 1935 the accumulated

18
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,510
inflation amounts to this spectacular

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,369
figure that you see on screen right now

20
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,810
that's a crazy 256 thousand trillion

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,270
percent this is the result of an average

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,130
annual inflation of more than 60 percent

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,080
since 1935

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,760
[Music]

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,170
but why can't Argentines get rid of

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,820
inflation what role does the political

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,920
class businesspeople and citizens plan

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,229
all of this why is the dollar so present

29
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,670
in the minds of Argentine sois listen up

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,180
[Applause]

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,310
[Music]

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,659
Debu up first of all we need to know

33
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:50,750
exactly what we mean by inflation is

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,640
often said that there's inflation when

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,840
the prices of goods and services

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,549
demanded by a country's population

37
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,640
increase in a general manner that's why

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,619
does it happen and what causes this

39
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,240
phenomenon and here is where that

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,159
special tool that we all use to make

41
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,500
exchanges comes into play and that of

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,290
course is money everyone knows that

43
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,110
money currency was historically metallic

44
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,269
and it's value was given precisely by

45
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,700
each metals weight and composition like

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,069
copper silver or gold but obviously this

47
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,380
wasn't very practical so overtime notes

48
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,970
that could be converted into gold and

49
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,100
silver began to be issued as these were

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,380
easier to carry it divided and therefore

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,269
used the convertibility system was

52
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:37,099
implemented until the thirties when due

53
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,480
to the Great Depression countries

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,100
gradually began to abandon the

55
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,590
convertibility system finally in 1971

56
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,870
Richard Nixon gave it to the final punch

57
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,730
I have directed secretary Connolly this

58
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,049
was Finn temporarily the convertibility

59
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:50,900
of the dollar in the gold or other

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,810
reserve asset from then on the value of

61
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,730
bills became completely dependent on the

62
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,049
trust that the market had on the

63
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:59,239
economic power of the solvency of the

64
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,829
country that issued them that's why the

65
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,600
notes issued by the richest countries

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,549
usually lead to the greatest value and

67
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:10,190
confidence in the markets

68
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,110
meanwhile government's no longer have to

69
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,210
stockpile gold and silver to support

70
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,290
their currency the ends of

71
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,970
convertibility gave the government's the

72
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,440
chance to use that all trend of ours as

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,300
much as they wanted that's of course the

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,730
bill printing machine

75
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,320
up until then if a government wanted to

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,810
spend more they'd be that to raise taxes

77
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,370
or borrowing money however the end of

78
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,750
convertibility gave them another

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,850
possibility finance public spending with

80
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,920
the creation of new money that is what

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,930
is popularly known as running the bill

82
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,960
printing machine the reality is that

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,460
these days all you need to do is push a

84
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,560
key and boom you've created all of the

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,620
electronic money you could possibly want

86
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,450
of course this has consequences if

87
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,370
central banks are prudence and economic

88
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,930
growth accompanies the issuance of new

89
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,210
money the effects of inflation won't be

90
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,740
excessively damaging but when

91
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,630
governments pass that barrier that's

92
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,490
when a very very serious problem begins

93
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,050
suddenly an artificial demand is created

94
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,060
that pushes up the price of goods on the

95
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
one hand and on the other makes people

96
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,780
lose confidence in that currency the

97
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,910
results a bolting of inflation of course

98
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,170
the government responsible for this

99
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,540
situation never wants to acknowledge its

100
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,060
responsibility which is why in the end

101
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,220
it always ends up liming entrepreneurs

102
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,530
accusing them of being speculators and

103
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,720
being greedy so then comes the magic

104
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,400
solution which only makes things worse

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,460
and that's price controls Argentina

106
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,830
unveils price controls to tame inflation

107
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,110
and no don't think this is a new idea

108
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,500
not at all rights control in Argentina a

109
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,910
history repeated by different

110
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,919
governments from Peron to alfonsín

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,660
everyone tried to do the same and were

112
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:50,590
never successful

113
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,030
Eloy hemos hecho nada niente McConkey

114
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,790
areas in your prison I'm a Robbie's code

115
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,280
unearthed in 1902 which was enacted

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,090
before 2000 BC set prices wages and

117
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,710
interest rates which means that price

118
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,320
controls are at least 4,000 years old

119
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,980
Henry Hazlitt

120
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,900
of course as this doesn't work either

121
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,090
and prices go up even more politicians

122
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,160
usually start raising salaries through

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,950
decrees and spending more on every kind

124
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,960
of plan and all of this is backed with

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,030
even more unpacked money being issued

126
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,340
it's a vicious cycle that only leads to

127
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,690
more and more inflation which means

128
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,160
destroying the value of savings

129
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,470
destroying a country's capital

130
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,820
annihilating legal security preventing

131
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,560
businesses from making calculations

132
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,450
which are vital for decisions and

133
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,700
depreciating the national currency and

134
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,650
few countries in the world know this

135
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:51,990
process better than Argentina the land

136
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,520
of inflation we told you in several

137
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,810
videos that Argentina's economic

138
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:11,760
situation is terrifying Network low

inflation folks

142
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,750
Argentina's high inflationary process

143
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,340
has been growing steadily since the

144
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,000
1950s Argentina on the podium year after

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,520
year inflation of 51.3% is the third

146
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,230
highest in the world behind only

147
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,420
Venezuela and Zimbabwe

148
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,730
now can you see the process we just

149
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,680
described who on earth is responsible

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
for this inflationary spiral well check

out this chart prepared by the economist

152
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,530
nicolas checque an auskey web we can see

153
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,630
the lack of control that Argentina's

154
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,070
public accounts are experiencing as you

155
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,360
can see it doesn't matter who governs

156
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,610
military civil perónist or radical the

157
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,010
result is the same every Argentine

158
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,600
government has devoted itself to

159
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,300
spending uncontrollably resorting to

160
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,670
both issuing debt first internal and

161
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,770
then also external as well as issuing

162
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,450
money and that's precisely what has

163
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,520
caused Argentina's current economic

164
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,370
disaster

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,560
yes you heard that right not imports not

167
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,360
vulture capitalism not greedy

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,850
businessman the truth is that these huge

169
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,100
public deficits have been financed and

170
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,740
continued to be financed with a huge

171
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,170
external debt very high inflation rates

172
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,480
that is with the bill printing machine

173
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,890
check out this table where you can see

174
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,840
the average annual inflation rates that

175
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,440
each argentinian president has had since

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,670
1943

177
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,770
[Music]

178
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,660
some presidents weren't in power for

179
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,580
long even less than a year others were

180
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,080
in the presidential chair much longer

181
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,819
presidents such as the well-known Peron

182
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,250
Videla or Alphonse in Cristina Fernandez

183
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,440
de Kirchner or Mauricio Macri were very

184
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,060
different but practically every

185
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,650
president had something in common very

186
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,630
high inflation rates this process has

187
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,940
become so constant that Argentines are

188
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,770
now used to living with huge inflation

189
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,479
of course that doesn't lessen their

190
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:12,949
disastrous economic effects at all

191
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,300
indeed it can make it even worse it's

192
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,650
logical that when you get used to a

193
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,750
quickly devaluing currency all market

194
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,009
participants act accordingly

195
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:23,990
entrepreneurs try to compensate for risk

196
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,090
for example by raising prices even more

197
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,639
the unions demand wage increases just in

198
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,349
case and the government in an attempt to

199
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,209
compensate for all the economic and

200
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,950
social problems that have emerged keep

201
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,270
approving all kinds of regulations

202
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,729
issuing debt in foreign currency because

203
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,169
of course the time comes when local

204
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,789
financial markets no longer serve any

205
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,589
purpose and continue to run the bill

206
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,270
printing machine and the problem just

207
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,820
accumulates and continues a kind of race

208
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,220
organized and driven by politicians in

209
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,899
which all participants lose especially

210
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:53,660
the poorest those who depends on their

211
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,190
salary to survive

212
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,470
and we can't fool ourselves a clear

213
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,149
result of high inflation is that it

214
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,250
destroys a country's competitiveness how

215
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,949
well first by consuming its savings the

216
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:07,019
local capital and then when governments

217
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,029
introduced restrictions of all kinds to

218
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,529
deal with the uncontrolled price

219
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,899
increases that ends up creating unstable

220
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,699
industries and economies that can't

221
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,990
compete in the world this folks is

222
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,000
precisely what is happening in Argentina

223
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,769
and that's why Argentina can't get out

224
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,720
of a crisis without getting into another

225
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,670
one is we're talking about more than 50

226
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,800
years of mistakes here it just seems

227
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,050
that Argentinian politicians they just

228
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,350
don't learn recurrent fiscal deficit in

229
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,170
2018 the state covered only 85% of its

230
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,740
expenses with actual income Argentine

231
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,990
debt is now close to ninety seven point

232
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,029
seven percent of the country's GDP and

233
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:46,649
is the highest in the region now the

234
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:48,600
question is do Argentinians have any

235
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,129
defense mechanism is there an

236
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,540
instruments that can help them protect

237
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,339
themselves from the stubbornness of

238
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,129
politicians and yes in a certain way

239
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:03,779
there is actually one so listen up

240
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,850
the dollar world you don't need to be an

241
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,830
economist to know that having savings in

242
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,470
argentine pesos is a very very bad idea

243
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,180
it's something that those of you who

244
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,890
follow us from argentina will probably

245
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,660
know so if your currency is losing value

246
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,550
by the day in such a significant way

247
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,920
then you have no choice but to look for

248
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,930
another currency to better preserve the

249
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,970
value of your savings and in Argentina's

250
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,440
case and for actually every other

251
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,640
country in the world with the same

252
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,000
problem that currency is the US dollar

253
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,740
the Argentine economy is de facto

254
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,200
dollarized it must be done for real

255
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,370
Roberto cata knows

256
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,590
in Argentina is usual for everyone to

257
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,270
know the exchange rate of the dollar to

258
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,520
the Argentine peso and for Argentinians

259
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,050
the dollar is important for several

260
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,520
reasons that's because the price of

261
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,530
products is closely linked to the price

262
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,090
of the dollar allow me to explain

263
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,890
Argentine import several goods since

264
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,900
with their own currency the peso losing

265
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,520
so much value so quickly practically

266
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,410
everything is traded in dollars which is

267
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,480
also the international reserve currency

268
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,090
this also happens with Argentine exports

269
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,920
the dollar is more stable and ultimately

270
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,840
becomes the reference units prices in

271
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,090
pesos like a crazy thermometer that

272
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,020
changes temperature constantly secondly

273
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,820
and most importantly the dollar is a

274
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,860
currency that allows Argentinian stupid

275
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,960
maintain the value of their savings yes

276
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,700
it's true that the dollar also suffers

277
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,710
from inflation but it's in proportions

278
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,510
that can't really be compared to the

279
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,300
Argentine peso for example in 2001 if we

280
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,340
have saved 20 thousand pesos in a drawer

281
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,930
that would be enough at the time for the

282
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,720
average car by 2019 with that same

283
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,340
amount of money we could hardly afford a

284
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,080
smartphone and no it wouldn't be an

285
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,190
iPhone the loss of value of the

286
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,490
Argentine peso is simply spectacular

287
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,860
[Music]

288
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,510
so that explains why in countries with

289
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,100
high inflation the dollar circulates

290
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,290
almost as if it were a national currency

291
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,600
it happens in Argentina and even North

292
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,790
Korea used its dollars since 1950

293
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,950
Argentina has barely managed to go ten

294
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,620
years between 1993 and 2002 with

295
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,779
inflation at moderate levels below 4%

296
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:20,050
that's only ten years in almost seven

297
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,810
decades

298
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,700
thus Argentina has become one of the few

299
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,440
countries in the world that can't

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,329
control its inflation and make no

301
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:33,579
mistakes the solution is clear reduce

302
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,470
public spending balanced budgets and

303
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,779
stop being so dependent on the central

304
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,269
bank politicians know this the question

305
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,610
is why on earth don't they implement it

306
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,930
and this leads me to another question

307
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,480
will Argentinian politicians be able to

308
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
end this eternal spiral of inflation

309
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,890
