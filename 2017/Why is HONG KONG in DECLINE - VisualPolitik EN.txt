[Music]

3
00:00:07.01 --> 00:00:11.210
on the first of July this year a very

4
00:00:09.48 --> 00:00:13.620
special anniversary was celebrated

5
00:00:11.21 --> 00:00:15.179
twenty years has passed since Hong Kong

6
00:00:13.62 --> 00:00:17.910
stopped being part of the United Kingdom

7
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.250
and returns to the People's Republic of

8
00:00:17.91 --> 00:00:21.750
China they did this under the model one

9
00:00:20.25 --> 00:00:23.460
country two systems'

10
00:00:21.75 --> 00:00:25.439
as you know although China is a

11
00:00:23.46 --> 00:00:27.300
dictatorship Hong Kong was incorporated

12
00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.670
into the country as a special

13
00:00:27.3 --> 00:00:32.099
administrative region where the basic

14
00:00:29.67 --> 00:00:33.870
law applies this is a law that grants

15
00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.250
the citizens of Hong Kong a list of

16
00:00:33.87 --> 00:00:37.620
rights and liberties which would be

17
00:00:35.25 --> 00:00:39.719
unthinkable in the rest of China perhaps

18
00:00:37.62 --> 00:00:41.280
with the exception of Macau

19
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.320
besides this Hong Kong has its own

20
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:45.510
currency its own immigration policy as

21
00:00:43.32 --> 00:00:47.460
well as its own police customs and

22
00:00:45.51 --> 00:00:49.230
courts so in its everyday life the

23
00:00:47.46 --> 00:00:51.600
country works almost as if it were an

24
00:00:49.23 --> 00:00:53.969
independent country but hold on just a

25
00:00:51.6 --> 00:00:56.370
minute here because I did say almost

26
00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.500
Beijing's interference has been getting

27
00:00:56.37 --> 00:01:00.840
more and more intense and don't think

28
00:00:58.5 --> 00:01:03.300
that Beijing is being discreet about it

29
00:01:00.84 --> 00:01:04.589
not at all in fact we already told you

30
00:01:03.3 --> 00:01:06.270
about it here on visual politic how

31
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.970
prose and mock recei advocates have been

32
00:01:06.27 --> 00:01:10.439
tortured and killed as an interesting a

33
00:01:08.97 --> 00:01:12.780
cited by the way China has recently

34
00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.490
kidnapped five librarians in Hong Kong

35
00:01:12.78 --> 00:01:16.200
for spreading ideas against China's

36
00:01:14.49 --> 00:01:18.390
control of the city so in order to

37
00:01:16.2 --> 00:01:20.520
celebrate this 20th anniversary Xi

38
00:01:18.39 --> 00:01:23.040
Jinping made his first visit to Hong

39
00:01:20.52 --> 00:01:28.490
Kong he is the president of China after

40
00:01:23.04 --> 00:01:31.470
all see Jinping in Hong Kong

41
00:01:28.49 --> 00:01:33.390
well Xi Jinping's visit was loaded with

42
00:01:31.47 --> 00:01:35.369
symbolism since it has happened at a

43
00:01:33.39 --> 00:01:37.560
time when China has been receiving lots

44
00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.600
and lots of criticism about Hong Kong

45
00:01:37.56 --> 00:01:41.549
this visit the viewer lasted for three

46
00:01:39.6 --> 00:01:43.590
days and in this short period of time

47
00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.590
the Chinese president has decided to

48
00:01:43.59 --> 00:01:49.020
make things pretty yeah

49
00:01:46.59 --> 00:01:51.240
any attempt to endanger national

50
00:01:49.02 --> 00:01:53.159
sovereignty and security challenge the

51
00:01:51.24 --> 00:01:55.530
power of the central government or use

52
00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.659
Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and

53
00:01:55.53 --> 00:01:59.939
sabotage activities against the mainland

54
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.729
is an act that crosses the red line and

55
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.649
is absolutely impermissible see Jim

56
00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.450
Payne in other words for Beijing all

57
00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.179
that stuff about freedom and speech and

58
00:02:06.45 --> 00:02:11.700
democracy in Hong Kong has a lot of

59
00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.040
limits and they are certainly not going

60
00:02:11.7 --> 00:02:16.380
to allow any activist or politician to

61
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:21.780
let things get out of hand and challenge

62
00:02:16.38 --> 00:02:23.430
Beijing's control in any way and well Xi

63
00:02:21.78 --> 00:02:29.819
Jinping doesn't just want to let them go

64
00:02:23.43 --> 00:02:31.620
with a warning absolutely not the

65
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.420
president of China also use this visit

66
00:02:31.62 --> 00:02:35.640
to preside over the largest military

67
00:02:33.42 --> 00:02:37.650
march in the history of Hong Kong with

68
00:02:35.64 --> 00:02:39.510
Chinese troops of course he also used

69
00:02:37.65 --> 00:02:41.459
his visit to attend the inaugural speech

70
00:02:39.51 --> 00:02:48.239
of Carrie Lam the chief executive of

71
00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.950
Hong Kong Xi Jinping is the superior

72
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.630
authority and even though basic law

73
00:02:49.95 --> 00:02:53.310
clearly forbids him from meddling in

74
00:02:51.63 --> 00:02:55.200
local politics he did take the

75
00:02:53.31 --> 00:02:57.510
opportunity to ask the new chief

76
00:02:55.2 --> 00:02:59.609
executive two things first he asked

77
00:02:57.51 --> 00:03:01.739
about the passing of an anti subversion

78
00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.269
law in order to convict all dissidents

79
00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.519
who dare to defend things such as

80
00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.010
democracy or independence for Hong Kong

81
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.920
and second the approval of a plan of

82
00:03:08.01 --> 00:03:12.269
patriotic education for the youth yep

83
00:03:10.92 --> 00:03:14.670
you heard that right and this is what

84
00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.410
happens in dictatorships they like their

85
00:03:14.67 --> 00:03:21.840
kids to be educated about their

86
00:03:16.41 --> 00:03:23.670
obedience to the regime so as you can

87
00:03:21.84 --> 00:03:25.680
probably imagine Hong Kong citizens were

88
00:03:23.67 --> 00:03:27.810
not particularly willing to do this and

89
00:03:25.68 --> 00:03:30.180
on July the first 60,000 people

90
00:03:27.81 --> 00:03:33.720
demonstrated demanding more freedom and

91
00:03:30.18 --> 00:03:36.569
more democracy I urge the people of Hong

92
00:03:33.72 --> 00:03:38.609
Kong do not give up once we give up then

93
00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.680
we will for certain slowly deteriorate

94
00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.470
into what is becoming of China today

95
00:03:40.68 --> 00:03:45.299
Avery in the chairman of the League of

96
00:03:43.47 --> 00:03:46.950
Social Democrats this is what things are

97
00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.359
like in Hong Kong and here a visual

98
00:03:46.95 --> 00:03:49.980
politic we're going to continue to pay

99
00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.109
close attention to the developing

100
00:03:49.98 --> 00:03:54.239
situation do not forget to subscribe if

101
00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.129
you haven't already so now that this

102
00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.200
20th anniversary has taken place there

103
00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.810
are some question

104
00:03:57.2 --> 00:04:01.849
that we can't help but ask how did Hong

105
00:03:59.81 --> 00:04:04.400
Kong do in the last 20 years haven't

106
00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.500
changed much as well what is the current

107
00:04:04.4 --> 00:04:07.120
situation well let's have a look at all

108
00:04:06.5 --> 00:04:11.440
of that

109
00:04:07.12 --> 00:04:16.290
[Music]

110
00:04:11.44 --> 00:04:18.210
Hong Kong is still Hong Kong

111
00:04:16.29 --> 00:04:20.040
that's the best news after these 20

112
00:04:18.21 --> 00:04:22.140
years is that Hong Kong well it still

113
00:04:20.04 --> 00:04:23.970
simply is Hong Kong a city completely

114
00:04:22.14 --> 00:04:26.300
different compared to the rest of China

115
00:04:23.97 --> 00:04:30.520
let me elaborate on this one

116
00:04:26.3 --> 00:04:33.400
[Music]

117
00:04:30.52 --> 00:04:36.009
Hong Kong it's still the wealthiest and

118
00:04:33.4 --> 00:04:37.210
freest city in China the courts were too

119
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.280
media and not under the control of

120
00:04:37.21 --> 00:04:41.560
censorship and political debate is

121
00:04:39.28 --> 00:04:43.539
vibrant vibrant enough in fact that

122
00:04:41.56 --> 00:04:45.550
protests against China they're quite

123
00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.259
frequent in fact a demonstration for

124
00:04:45.55 --> 00:04:49.180
freedom with more than sixty thousand

125
00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.289
people against Xi Jinping's visits

126
00:04:49.18 --> 00:04:52.289
there's a good example of this

127
00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.270
furthermore during these years economic

128
00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.520
growth has been an average of 3.3% every

129
00:04:58.27 --> 00:05:02.770
year and well this is a decent figure

130
00:05:00.52 --> 00:05:04.750
now it might not be as high as in some

131
00:05:02.77 --> 00:05:06.580
other Asian countries like Singapore or

132
00:05:04.75 --> 00:05:08.740
some non Asian countries like Islands

133
00:05:06.58 --> 00:05:11.349
but this is still higher than the growth

134
00:05:08.74 --> 00:05:13.150
rate of most rich countries in fact

135
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.710
during this time more than 1 million

136
00:05:13.15 --> 00:05:16.780
Chinese have moved to Hong Kong in

137
00:05:14.71 --> 00:05:19.090
cetera that a future the city has also

138
00:05:16.78 --> 00:05:22.000
cemented its position as a leading

139
00:05:19.09 --> 00:05:23.440
global financial center the number of

140
00:05:22.0 --> 00:05:25.509
publicly listed companies on the

141
00:05:23.44 --> 00:05:28.060
exchange has increased three times since

142
00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.000
1997 and market capitalization reached

143
00:05:28.06 --> 00:05:33.069
three point two trillion by 2016

144
00:05:31.0 --> 00:05:36.340
that's equal to almost all of Germany's

145
00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.949
GDP also with 60 million tourists a year

146
00:05:36.34 --> 00:05:41.380
Hong Kong has also become quite a power

147
00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.789
in the tourist sector however still hold

148
00:05:41.38 --> 00:05:44.440
on for just a second because the country

149
00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.509
is also showing symptoms which could

150
00:05:44.44 --> 00:05:55.510
indicate that the model is getting

151
00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:57.910
obsolete the downfall of a single model

152
00:05:55.51 --> 00:05:59.590
it is true that economic growth on this

153
00:05:57.91 --> 00:06:02.140
island has been decent but it's also

154
00:05:59.59 --> 00:06:03.850
true that it has slowed down with time

155
00:06:02.14 --> 00:06:06.520
further savings have collapsed and the

156
00:06:03.85 --> 00:06:08.320
future just seems worse and not just for

157
00:06:06.52 --> 00:06:10.600
the political situation this is probably

158
00:06:08.32 --> 00:06:13.570
the worst time in 20 years for Hong Kong

159
00:06:10.6 --> 00:06:15.490
jong-hong Xinhua former financial

160
00:06:13.57 --> 00:06:17.800
secretary of Hong Kong there is an

161
00:06:15.49 --> 00:06:19.930
increasing feeling that Hong Kong hasn't

162
00:06:17.8 --> 00:06:21.760
succeeded in adapting to the modern

163
00:06:19.93 --> 00:06:23.980
economic environment and that there is a

164
00:06:21.76 --> 00:06:25.930
risk of them being a source of cheap

165
00:06:23.98 --> 00:06:28.330
tacky seen parts of businessman and

166
00:06:25.93 --> 00:06:29.620
tourists so maybe it's the cities of the

167
00:06:28.33 --> 00:06:31.420
Pearl River Delta where the lack of

168
00:06:29.62 --> 00:06:33.070
drawing from Hong Kong can many be

169
00:06:31.42 --> 00:06:34.900
better understood this is the region

170
00:06:33.07 --> 00:06:36.550
which hong kong belongs to and

171
00:06:34.9 --> 00:06:39.340
traditionally the city has been the

172
00:06:36.55 --> 00:06:41.020
center of attention today this is just

173
00:06:39.34 --> 00:06:45.220
not the case anymore i mean take a look

174
00:06:41.02 --> 00:06:47.140
at Shenzhen for example this Chinese

175
00:06:45.22 --> 00:06:49.480
city with nothing but a poor fishing

176
00:06:47.14 --> 00:06:51.970
town of 50,000 inhabitants 50 years ago

177
00:06:49.48 --> 00:06:53.890
today the city is actually massive with

178
00:06:51.97 --> 00:06:55.690
a population of more than 15 million

179
00:06:53.89 --> 00:06:58.000
people they also have as many companies

180
00:06:55.69 --> 00:07:00.130
in the fortune 500 as Hong Kong and it

181
00:06:58.0 --> 00:07:02.680
is an important high-tech Center which

182
00:07:00.13 --> 00:07:05.890
holds many notable companies like 10

183
00:07:02.68 --> 00:07:07.660
cent and Huawei and now many believe

184
00:07:05.89 --> 00:07:10.030
that the Duchenne's then north hong kong

185
00:07:07.66 --> 00:07:12.460
who is destined to be a major player in

186
00:07:10.03 --> 00:07:15.850
the area and also consider this other

187
00:07:12.46 --> 00:07:17.860
stat in 1997 Hong Kong represented 20%

188
00:07:15.85 --> 00:07:20.830
of the Chinese economy today that figure

189
00:07:17.86 --> 00:07:23.500
is less than 3% this illustrates well

190
00:07:20.83 --> 00:07:25.540
just how much things are changing Hong

191
00:07:23.5 --> 00:07:27.640
Kong's economy is stuck with remarkably

192
00:07:25.54 --> 00:07:28.270
little change to show for the past two

193
00:07:27.64 --> 00:07:30.910
decades

194
00:07:28.27 --> 00:07:32.860
címon cartilage and the truth is know if

195
00:07:30.91 --> 00:07:35.110
it has very little to do with luck

196
00:07:32.86 --> 00:07:37.210
Hong Kong has made significant mistakes

197
00:07:35.11 --> 00:07:39.070
so well the question might now be well

198
00:07:37.21 --> 00:07:40.780
what are the major one well these two

199
00:07:39.07 --> 00:07:42.670
they're a great place to start first

200
00:07:40.78 --> 00:07:44.889
there's a housing market which has been

201
00:07:42.67 --> 00:07:47.349
a total disaster

202
00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:49.060
real estate prices in Hong Kong have

203
00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:50.620
gone through the ceilings the prices

204
00:07:49.06 --> 00:07:52.090
have gone so crazy that most of its

205
00:07:50.62 --> 00:07:53.740
citizens and though that the only chance

206
00:07:52.09 --> 00:07:55.300
they have of getting a house is to get a

207
00:07:53.74 --> 00:07:58.900
public one and the odds of that

208
00:07:55.3 --> 00:08:00.460
happening are really really low and when

209
00:07:58.9 --> 00:08:02.710
there aren't enough houses available all

210
00:08:00.46 --> 00:08:04.659
spaces becomes very expensive and this

211
00:08:02.71 --> 00:08:06.789
makes it complicated for startups and

212
00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:08.830
new companies to establish themselves in

213
00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:11.860
Hong Kong and this triggers crazy

214
00:08:08.83 --> 00:08:13.689
situations like this one Hong Kong

215
00:08:11.86 --> 00:08:15.639
parking space sells for record six

216
00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:19.150
hundred and sixty four thousand three

217
00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:21.490
hundred dollars and the problem here is

218
00:08:19.15 --> 00:08:23.469
not a lack of land not at all in fact

219
00:08:21.49 --> 00:08:25.569
less than 25 percent of Hong Kong's

220
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:27.779
surface area is urbanized and there are

221
00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:31.360
other possibilities like using the sea

222
00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:33.550
land it's really not the issue Hong Kong

223
00:08:31.36 --> 00:08:35.110
it has a very free economy the priest in

224
00:08:33.55 --> 00:08:37.570
the world according to the index of

225
00:08:35.11 --> 00:08:39.880
economic freedom but it is not free when

226
00:08:37.57 --> 00:08:42.099
it comes to land housing and Town

227
00:08:39.88 --> 00:08:43.449
Planning in Hong Kong the government is

228
00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:46.240
the one in charge of the housing sector

229
00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:48.550
and it has become a complete failure in

230
00:08:46.24 --> 00:08:50.350
the last few decades there are over 200

231
00:08:48.55 --> 00:08:52.209
hectares of land available for building

232
00:08:50.35 --> 00:08:53.890
in the urban areas the shortage of

233
00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:55.899
housing is real but that is because of

234
00:08:53.89 --> 00:08:58.449
deliberate manipulation of the market by

235
00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:01.089
the government John White a barrister

236
00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:02.589
and chairman of friends of cyclones pay

237
00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:04.029
close attention here because housing

238
00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:06.370
developments have been frozen because

239
00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:07.959
they law from the colonial times for

240
00:09:06.37 --> 00:09:09.699
decades the local government leased

241
00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.680
farmer's land in order to grow rice

242
00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:14.320
these communities support the government

243
00:09:11.68 --> 00:09:16.360
in Beijing and and nobody wants to mess

244
00:09:14.32 --> 00:09:18.760
with them it really is a totally crazy

245
00:09:16.36 --> 00:09:20.709
system and some people are suspicious

246
00:09:18.76 --> 00:09:22.240
that they have good reason to be the

247
00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:24.519
government may have tried to go on a

248
00:09:22.24 --> 00:09:27.699
favor from some oligarchs with big real

249
00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:29.529
estate deals some convictions have

250
00:09:27.699 --> 00:09:31.390
actually shown this corruption and have

251
00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:33.279
concerned these suspicious links between

252
00:09:31.39 --> 00:09:36.550
government workers and the real estate

253
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:39.190
magnets of Hong Kong this might explain

254
00:09:36.55 --> 00:09:42.350
why seven of the 14 richest real estate

255
00:09:39.19 --> 00:09:44.940
investors are from Hong Kong

256
00:09:42.35 --> 00:09:47.070
as well this leads us on to another

257
00:09:44.94 --> 00:09:55.490
issue and that's the growing amount of

258
00:09:47.07 --> 00:09:58.410
crony capitalism an uncertain future

259
00:09:55.49 --> 00:09:59.970
most people agree capitalism has lost

260
00:09:58.41 --> 00:10:02.580
its strength in the last years - a

261
00:09:59.97 --> 00:10:04.560
system with a similar name but a totally

262
00:10:02.58 --> 00:10:09.750
different essence and that system is

263
00:10:04.56 --> 00:10:11.490
crony capitalism under the British the

264
00:10:09.75 --> 00:10:14.190
government was pro-business but not of

265
00:10:11.49 --> 00:10:15.360
business since 1997 business interests

266
00:10:14.19 --> 00:10:17.010
have been baked into the political

267
00:10:15.36 --> 00:10:20.220
system conflicts of interest of

268
00:10:17.01 --> 00:10:22.350
multiplied cronyism has grown in many

269
00:10:20.22 --> 00:10:24.210
sectors competition has been replaced by

270
00:10:22.35 --> 00:10:25.860
well-connected oligopolies and

271
00:10:24.21 --> 00:10:28.170
monopolies and the worst thing is that

272
00:10:25.86 --> 00:10:30.300
things are getting worse as China is

273
00:10:28.17 --> 00:10:32.460
regaining its power in the city as an

274
00:10:30.3 --> 00:10:34.530
example the liaison office which is like

275
00:10:32.46 --> 00:10:36.480
the Chinese delegation there is even

276
00:10:34.53 --> 00:10:38.460
giving out loans with better conditions

277
00:10:36.48 --> 00:10:39.900
to friendly companies in order to

278
00:10:38.46 --> 00:10:42.180
increase their influence and their

279
00:10:39.9 --> 00:10:43.440
political power and what to know was

280
00:10:42.18 --> 00:10:46.830
required in order to get one of these

281
00:10:43.44 --> 00:10:49.080
loans well you need to have connections

282
00:10:46.83 --> 00:10:50.370
and to make all of this worse this is

283
00:10:49.08 --> 00:10:52.530
all surrounded by the political

284
00:10:50.37 --> 00:10:54.360
conflicts that we've already told you

285
00:10:52.53 --> 00:10:56.580
about anyway there is Terry lambs

286
00:10:54.36 --> 00:10:58.980
mission to address all these problems

287
00:10:56.58 --> 00:11:00.900
her legitimacy is also questionable

288
00:10:58.98 --> 00:11:03.150
natural she wasn't elected buying the

289
00:11:00.9 --> 00:11:05.190
citizens she was elected by a group of

290
00:11:03.15 --> 00:11:08.000
people who are led by Beijing's

291
00:11:05.19 --> 00:11:08.000
directive

292
00:11:08.48 --> 00:11:13.110
so there was this kind of you when the

293
00:11:10.95 --> 00:11:15.060
Hongkong was thought to be the city on

294
00:11:13.11 --> 00:11:17.220
the hill for China's political change

295
00:11:15.06 --> 00:11:18.930
unfortunately those things look quite

296
00:11:17.22 --> 00:11:21.300
different nowadays and the question

297
00:11:18.93 --> 00:11:23.910
becomes what was the future of Hong Kong

298
00:11:21.3 --> 00:11:25.920
be like would it be in the light or will

299
00:11:23.91 --> 00:11:27.270
it be in the shadows well now it's your

300
00:11:25.92 --> 00:11:29.460
