1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,520
in the past most of the people in this

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,310
room voted for a wall but the proper

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,090
wall never got built I will get it built

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,969
on February the 15th 2019 the presidents

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,740
of the United States Donald Trump

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,680
decreed a state of national emergency to

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,289
confront this national security crisis

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,660
last month I declared a national

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,119
emergency initially he did this against

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,769
his own lawyers recommendation and

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,780
opposition from practically all of the

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,090
Democrats as well as a good number of

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,879
Republicans I watch some good people

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,840
they're friends of mine

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,550
very concerned by his own accounts the

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,140
president made this decision to

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,210
accomplish what Congress was preventing

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,590
him from doing building the

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,449
controversial wall along the Mexican

20
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,399
border according to the president the

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,170
United States is suffering from an

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,789
invasion of drugs immigrants and

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,500
criminals that is putting national

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,289
security at risk not one more American

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,920
life should be lost because our nation

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,290
fails to control it's very dangerous

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,540
border now according to Mick Mulvaney

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,159
the president's chief of staff the

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,630
administration will have about eight

30
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,369
billion dollars to close the Mexican

31
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:16,500
border in the name of national security

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,470
but Istavan effects because this is

33
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,909
significant when we started this project

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,740
visual politic we wanted to create a

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,150
channel where we could tell you about

36
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,890
the things that were happening in the

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,840
worlds in a free and independent way

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,430
always backed up with data and

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,590
information as references and folks

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,880
that's precisely what we like to do

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,380
where the along Donald Trump or not no

42
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,150
matter how you feel about immigration

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,890
what we are going to tell you in this

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,659
video is what the latest information

45
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,890
tells us

46
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,410
[Applause]

47
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,240
[Music]

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,700
a little more than two years ago Donald

49
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,049
Trump arrived at the White House with a

50
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:55,180
promise that stood out above the rest to

51
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,610
build a huge wall along the entire

52
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,590
Mexican border we're gonna build the

53
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,060
wall we have no choice a wall of almost

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,560
2,000 miles that's more than 3,000

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,390
kilometers give you an idea of what this

56
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,399
means we can take a look at what this

57
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,870
project might end up costing first let's

58
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,250
say in the consideration that there are

59
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,170
more than 600 miles of walls and fences

60
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,970
already built to close the border to

61
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,890
Trump specifications that is by building

62
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,840
a wall that is at least 30 feet high

63
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,250
with mario's that hinder the

64
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,750
construction of tunnels would cost

65
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,640
according to the best estimates more

66
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,130
than 30 billion dollars the Department

67
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,750
of national security has estimated the

68
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,250
cost of completing the borders closure

69
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,470
to be more than 20 billion that is if

70
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,180
they opted for a more modest alternative

71
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,130
based on the existing section a

72
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,989
combination of walls and fences and a

73
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,530
still rings in a twenty billion dollars

74
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,310
and we're not only talking about

75
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,080
construction costs because you can tell

76
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
you that maintaining such an

77
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,470
infrastructure is not going to be cheap

78
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,910
now before we just write this whole

79
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,230
thing off on cost alone I think there

80
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,150
are a few questions that we should

81
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,610
probably answer why has this wall been

82
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,140
so controversial

83
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,180
why opposable that in principle would

84
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,250
maintain order at the border enforce the

85
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,870
law and dissuade many people from

86
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,549
embarking on a journey that could cost

87
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,440
them their lives and is there any truth

88
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,209
in Trump's claim that with this wall the

89
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,340
United States would be a safer country

90
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:21,640
well listen up the wall history and

91
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
unexpected consequences the truth is

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,590
that Donald Trump's proposal it isn't

93
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,420
exactly original idea of closing the

94
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,519
Mexican border it began in 1986 when

95
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,680
Ronald Reagan built 22 kilometres of

96
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,989
steel fences in San Diego he did this in

97
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,239
exchange for legalizing millions of

98
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,859
illegal immigrants in what has become

99
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,930
the largest naturalization program in

100
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,850
the history of the United States is the

101
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,070
most comprehensive reform of our

102
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,070
immigration laws since 1952 it's the

103
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,570
product of one of the longest and most

104
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,670
difficult legislative undertakings in

105
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,280
the last three congresses further it's

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,049
an excellent example of a truly

107
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,260
successful bipartisan effort Hispanics

108
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,840
honor Nancy Reagan and thank the amnesty

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,930
signed by her husband Ronald in 86 yep

110
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,850
that was certainly a rather different

111
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,220
era for the Republican Party and these

112
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,139
are employers down through the years who

113
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,970
have encouraged the illegal entry into

114
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,250
this country because they then hire

115
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,739
these individuals and hire them as

116
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,870
starvation wages and with none of the

117
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,579
benefits that we think are normal and

118
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,540
natural for workers in our country I

119
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,570
believe in the idea of amnesty for those

120
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,400
who have put down roots and who have

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,590
lived here even though some time back

122
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,220
they may have entered illegally

123
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,920
the fact is that by the year 2000 the

124
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,540
length of the fortified border with

125
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,210
walls or fences had barely grown to 60

126
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,520
miles or about a hundred kilometers and

127
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,350
almost all of that was in urban areas

128
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:53,210
what is it we have here

129
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,070
your Spanish today was just been fatal

130
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,770
bus in 2006 there was a dramatic turning

131
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,930
point in exchange for putting forward a

132
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,880
bill that would help naturalize almost

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
all illegal immigrants a law that in the

134
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,140
end wasn't approved George Bush agreed

135
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,300
to build a border fence of almost 700

136
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,810
miles

137
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,940
most of these agreed fences are in place

138
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,690
today the point is that these barriers

139
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,400
have had consequences that just might

140
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,870
surprise you see until the 1990s people

141
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,580
could move rather freely across the

142
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,290
border so many workers mainly from

143
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,910
Mexico crossed between the two countries

144
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,430
numerous times for example they crossed

145
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,020
it for agricultural work during the

146
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,730
summer and then returned home during the

147
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,380
winter that way although many people

148
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,300
crossed the border irregularly the

149
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,950
number of illegal immigrants permanently

150
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,360
living in the United States remained

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
more or less stable at around 3 million

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,450
people however as the kilometers of

153
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,580
fences walls and border controls

154
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,590
increased that cost of crossing the

155
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,530
border it skyrocketed between 1995 and

156
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,870
2009 the cost of crossing the border for

157
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,850
an immigrants rose from 500 dollars to

158
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,699
more than 5,000 they multiplied by 10

159
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,050
this huge increase in the cost of

160
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,249
crossing the border along with the

161
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,960
higher risks of being detained caused

162
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,639
people who did make it to the United

163
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,490
States to simply stay there and work and

164
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,150
not leave and that's precisely one of

165
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,099
the reasons why in spite of having three

166
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:21,990
times as many border agents in more than

167
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,969
600 miles of completed fences and walls

168
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,620
the number of illegal immigrants living

169
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,300
in the United States today is much

170
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,310
higher than it was in the 70s 80s or 90s

171
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,349
now there are other factors that

172
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,840
contribute to this of course but this is

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,669
a significant one it supports the

174
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,800
argument that the wall might not be as

175
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
effective in reducing immigration as it

176
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,339
would seem at the end of the day the

177
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,990
incentive to cross the border is so

178
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,969
great that walls haven't been an

179
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,099
impediment even though the mechanisms to

180
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,870
cross them have become more expensive

181
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,849
it appears that balls are indeed having

182
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,439
the opposite effect on permanent

183
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,360
immigration to the intended one

184
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,980
[Music]

185
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,660
what's more we can't forget that in

186
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,310
recent years there has been another

187
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,870
great change these days the vast

188
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,880
majority of illegal immigrants no longer

189
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,230
cross the border illegally basically

190
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,730
they take a plane that lands in the

191
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,140
United States and when their visa

192
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,160
expires as they just stay and the wall

193
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
it's not going to do anything to stop

194
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,100
that happening

195
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,810
[Music]

196
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,510
the folks this only partially answers

197
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,190
our questions we need to now see how the

198
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,050
war could stem the invasion of criminals

199
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,490
which Donald Trump considers for

200
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,560
national emergency

201
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,100
[Music]

202
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,069
the non national emergency

203
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,050
the white house is very clear on one

204
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,939
point the Mexican water has become an

205
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,499
entry points for foreign criminals to

206
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,629
enter the u.s. ceiling this border is a

207
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:54,580
matter of national security but how true

208
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,909
is this really well if it were true

209
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,919
would likely see three things first

210
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,270
there would be some evidence of

211
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,979
criminals arriving across the border

212
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,389
second the border zones would be

213
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,490
dangerous places for example for the

214
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,349
people working border security I mean if

215
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,149
the border was infested with criminals

216
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:11,740
and drug dealers cross it like it's

217
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,300
their territory than being a border

218
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,409
guard would be quite a dangerous

219
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,689
profession and third the state's most

220
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,339
affected by crime would be those that

221
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,379
have the most illegal immigrants so ask

222
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,759
yourself this question do you think

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,789
these three points bear outs in reality

224
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,199
well let's start with the first question

225
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,740
shall we

226
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,230
if the border is leaking criminals it

227
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,460
would follow that you would see many

228
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,410
criminals going through it well folks

229
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,480
according to the US government's own

230
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,880
data this isn't quite so illegal

231
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,470
immigrants detained by Border Patrol's

232
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,200
to have very low crime histories and on

233
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
top of that the number is getting

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,460
smaller for example only point zero four

235
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,170
percents of illegal immigrants arrested

236
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,150
had convictions for serious crimes like

237
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,010
homicide

238
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:05,970
[Music]

239
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,310
this rate is lower than that of the

240
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,830
United States as a whole because the

241
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,480
thing is at the border we typically see

242
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,190
families arriving you want some more

243
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,470
data the rate of murders of Border Guard

244
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,300
security staff that is the people who

245
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,190
are on the front lines against all those

246
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,650
invading criminals is just two agents

247
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,870
per hundred thousand this is almost ten

248
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,300
times lower than the 19.7 rate recorded

249
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,590
for the police force throughout the rest

250
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,780
of the country it is also less than half

251
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,220
of the murder rates in the general

252
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,880
population of the United States

253

[Music]

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:51,150
[Music]

255
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,920
in other words border guards are less

256
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,420
likely to be murdered at work than any

257
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,250
other citizen of the United States going

258
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:03,330
about their regular lives all this means

259
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,740
that to say there's a national emergency

260
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,260
at the border would mean that other US

261
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,600
cities basically war zones but I don't

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,589
want some of you might be thinking right

263
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:12,089
now you're thinking what Simon criminals

264
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,740
are very clever and they know how to get

265
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,540
past border patrol without being

266
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,310
arrested well in that case let's imagine

267
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,470
that some of these bad dudes are getting

268
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,660
through probably then expect to see some

269
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,550
evidence of increased criminal activity

270
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,410
in the border territories right well

271
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,300
let's check the data it turns out that

272
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
the crime rate in the 23 counties

273
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,510
located along the Mexican border is

274
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,400
actually lower than rates in u.s.

275
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,410
counties that knots on the Mexican

276
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:34,740
border

277
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:50,540
[Music]

278
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,580
in Texas the rate of criminal

279
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,260
convictions for illegal immigrants is

280
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,630
almost half of that of official

281
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,270
residence

282
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:05,300
[Music]

283
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,610
all of this brings us to our third point

284
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,500
is it true that the most dangerous

285
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,480
states in the United States are the ones

286
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,550
with the most illegal immigrants because

287
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,020
well they're more likely to commit

288
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,500
crimes well the answer to that is no not

289
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,320
at all in fact it really is the opposite

290
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,730
illegal immigrants are less likely to

291
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,620
commit crimes than the general US

292
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,480
population and by the way legal

293
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,760
immigrants are even less likely the

294
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,710
states where high percentages of the

295
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,540
population are made up of illegal

296
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,630
immigrants while they're actually safer

297
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,530
[Music]

298
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,760
look folks we can discuss whether

299
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,990
immigration is positive or negative

300
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,670
effects on the economy which is

301
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,140
something we've talked about here on

302
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,850
this channel in the past but in the

303
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,010
United States it's clear that immigrants

304
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,140
do not have a negative effect on crime

305
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,330
in fact it's quite the opposite it's

306
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,280
also clear that the wall is not gonna

307
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,750
stop illegal immigration

308
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,730
therefore spending millions on something

309
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,560
useless it might not be the smartest

310
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,690
move that's why so many people oppose

311
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,900
the precious wall including many many

312
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,680
Republicans we will defend the American

313
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,310
Way of life

314
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:22,220
and we will always defend we don't have

315
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,090
a country

316
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,950
when you consider facts and data the

317
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,990
wall policy is just sloppy and this

318
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,760
isn't even to mention Trump's abuse of

319
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,560
power in trying to bypass Congress's

320
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
Authority and the separation of powers

321
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,250
with a tool designed exclusively for

322
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,800
farad war cases of national emergency I

323
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,960
watch of good people that friends of

324
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,630
mine and this obviously is not an

325
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,070
emergency particularly because neither

326
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,080
national security is at risk nor biz

327
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,850
illegal immigration something that is

328
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,120
going to be solved immediately or simply

329
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,350
so finally folks with this video we

330
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,030
tried to collect the main points and lay

331
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,740
them on the table so we can understand

332
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,020
why so many people oppose the war

333
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,370
because opposing the wallet doesn't

334
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,590
necessarily imply being in favor of open

335
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,160
borders

336
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,080
it simply means being against an idea

337
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,000
that looking at the data available only

338
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,680
seems to benefit the companies that are

339
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,630
gonna build it by the way in order to

340
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,070
build it the United States government

341
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,570
would have to expropriate its rights

342
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,430
over an enormous amount of privately

343
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,140
owned territory which seems a bit

344
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,210
heavy-handed don't you think so I really

345
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,620

national security crisis last month I

359
