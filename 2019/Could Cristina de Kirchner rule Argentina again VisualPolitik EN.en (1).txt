00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,179
fernandez returned to control and

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,040
dominate argentina could something like

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,510
this ever happen

a political earthquake in argentina an

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,410
earthquake that also had significant

10
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:31,380
economic consequences you see the

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,750
consultancy firm insomnia a company that

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,399
actually has close ties to the

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,079
government's and has been working with

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,969
Macri for several years noted that if

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,129
the next argentinian elections reached

held on October the 27th and November

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,340
the 24th for the second rounds if that

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,309
happens Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner

20
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:51,899
hypothetical candidacy would win over

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,540
the current president Mauricio Macri

[Music]

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,080
right now poor economic performance is

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,790
causing support for president Macri to

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,940
plummet inflation is extremely high

26
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,100
tariff increases and the sense that

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,420
nothing has really changed in the

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,340
political level has caused Mauricio

29
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,030
macri's popularity to drop like a rock

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,540
but just a second on May the 18th the

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,159
second political earthquake shook

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,960
Argentina for the first time in history

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,150
of vice presidential candidate named her

niveau an associate our Cristina

40
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,549
Fernandez made her decision do you stand

41
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,220
for election public but not as number

42
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,950
one as the two vice presidential

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,979

46
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,100
the cash nearest candidate will be

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,170
alberta fernandez néstor Kirchner's

48
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,540
chief of staff he also held that post in

49
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,610
Christina's government for one year

50
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,130
I've asked Alberto Fernandez to present

51
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,290
the formula that we will run together he

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,630
as the presidential candidate and I as

53
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,430
vice president to participate in the

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,160
upcoming primary open simultaneous and

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,680
mandatory elections Cristina Fernandez

56
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,750
de Kirchner face do with this leadership

57
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,000
scenario at least three questions

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,370
surface the first is easy one earth did

59
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,540
Kirchner decide to do this Super Saver

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,900
era

61
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,359
eNOS objetivos nadie puede ser la cosa

62
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:45,350
dos três anos well let's just say that

63
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,730
the answer has a lot to do with their

64
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,160
currently good popularity as we've seen

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,650
for the first time since 2015 several

66
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,750
polls place Kirchner as the winner for

67
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,880
not only the first rounds but also the

68
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,890
second eat it fast so the experiment

69
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,540
goes amiga company receipt concern

70
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,709
educating and I wound up a lot of

71
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,230
seizures and plus a fee economy okay

72
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,900
Marino know why not

73
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,590
[Music]

74
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,210
now hold on just a second the same

75
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,160
forecasts also indicated a high number

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,620
of undecided votes and folks this was

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,780
very clear to election experts the fear

78
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,670
of Kirchner's return once it's election

79
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,590
time could shift many votes back to the

80
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,170
current ruling party however with this

81
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,970
decision two things happen on the one

82
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,070
hand fear of the former president is

83
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,810
somewhat diluted she's no longer

84
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,910
presidential candidate and on the other

85
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,190
the new duo could reach voters that

86
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,590
Kirchner would have never reached alone

87
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,280
[Music]

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,090
allow me to explain

89
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,770
Alberto Fernandes candidacy puts

90
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,870
regeneration ISM on the table his

91
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,910
discourse is more moderate and as the

92
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,770
idea that the new duo would apply

93
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,690
different policies to those implemented

94
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,610
by Christina in the past this is

95
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,340
essential to achieve victory because of

96
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,840
course if you want to win the elections

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,030
you can't just count on your stores you

98
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,070
have to convince new voters who are also

99
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,800
taking care not to mobilize your rivals

100
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:14,490
vote as vice president christina

101
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,410
contributes all her electoral strength

102
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,720
without causing excessive fear so based

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,790
on this scenario the former president's

104
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,650
decisions multiply her options of

105
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,080
returning to power and that's what she

106
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,850
cares about the most not just because

107
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,800
she likes power but because she needs to

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,170
maintain the rights that go with being a

109
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,120
high-level politician in order to

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,290
survive

111
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,940
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner needed to

112
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,680
participate in the elections due to a

113
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
legal situation which we already have

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,100
discussed here on visual politic the

115
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,290
ex-president has ten prosecutions and

116
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,460
five preventive detention requests you

117
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,380
see the only reason she isn't already in

118
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,210
jail is because she still has her

119
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,980
senator privileges for Senate which is

120
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,380
dominated by para nests is simply not

121
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,000
withdrawn them so the first question why

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,010
she decided to run as vice president as

123
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,360
has already been answered the second

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,550
question is can this pairing really win

125
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,900
the elections and I mean are we really

126
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,490
being serious here the previous

127
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,470
government's results before not exactly

128
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,000
brilliant and there was a lot of

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:25,490
corruption the steerer Krishnas

130
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,040
processing in notebooks scandal extended

131
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,470
judge cloudy open a deal considered her

132
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,200
a co-author of five other acts of

133
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,630
bribery and raised the embargo against

134
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:41,379
her 218 million pesos

135
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,529
well yeah at least that's what the voter

136
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:46,960
intentions studies save surveys place

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,610
Kouchner ahead with an advantage of nine

138
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,319
point five and four in two different

139
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,419
surveys we can also find surveys even

140
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,249
more important ones which put Macri in

141
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:56,259
the lead but by an increasingly smaller

142
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,149
margin and of course now with the new

143
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,919
formula many of the fears of Kirchner

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,689
ISM have diluted particularly because

145
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:03,669
Alberto Fernandez himself was very

146
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,819
critical of the form of residents she

147
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:09,460
even said that Germany was worse than us

148
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,740
in terms of poverty maintained that the

149
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,959
stocks didn't exist and that inflation

150
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,599
didn't matter in the end that's denial a

151
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,979
stubborn sometimes

152
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:21,819
absurd denial Alberto Fernandez 2015

153
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,889
that is how overnight the Kirchner

154
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,379
created formula can be seen as a sign of

155
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:29,080
change something like hey we learned our

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,789
mistakes but our intentions they were

157
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,740
always good and now we've got it figured

158
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,689
out and the important thing isn't a

159
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:37,149
person's job title but the projects

160
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:42,150
pretty incredible right

161
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,430
now let's be clear you can't really say

162
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,350
that this is a surprising or an

163
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,750
exceptional scenario not at all

164
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,600
it's part of a fairly predictable trend

165
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,940
actually Macri has gone from leading in

166
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,740
the polls in January to drawing with

167
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,270
Christina in March and then lagging

168
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,870
behind her in April as incredible as it

169
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,550
may seem according to the polls

170
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,169
Christina's support hasn't stopped

171
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,820
rising the former presidents has gone

172
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,830
from being a headache Peron ism which

173
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,600
wanted to revamp its image to becoming

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,430
its best wild cards a chance of

175
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,720
recovering the governments of the

176
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,350
Republic at the moment it seems like the

177
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,510
evolution of the economy will be the

178
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,340
decisive factor here if things weren't

179
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,620
so bad perhaps even Macri could get

180
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,510
enough support from undecided voters do

181
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,970
remain in the Casa Rosada the problem as

182
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,650
things stand breathing the economic

183
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,750
situation in the short-term seems quite

184
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,150
complicated and that that is Kirchner's

185
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,550
best card right now one more slip and

186
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,870
Macri is sent to the bench you see the

187
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,430
Argentine economy is going through a

188
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,310
very very fragile time inflation in

189
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,690
March was four point seven percent

190
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,270
that's the rate for one month not one

191
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,320
year 2019 could close with a 35 to 50

192
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,360
percent inflation rate the peso p-- just

193
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,280
keeps falling against the dollar stocks

194
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
of not doing well and the country's risk

195
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,300
is now over a thousand points and the

196
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,269
country is still in recession

197
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,679
folks that race between mockery and

198
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,509
Kirchner's hypothetical can disease has

199
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,419
become a race to be the least bad in the

200
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:19,309
eyes of public opinion and now this

201
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,409
isn't just our criticism this is just

202
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:22,600
simple fact

203
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,660
[Music]

204
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,880
both Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and

205
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,370
Mauricio Macri are reaping very negative

206
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,740
evaluations from the Argentinians in the

207
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,210
case of the current president according

208
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,830
to surveys up to 84 percent of

209
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,539
Argentinians have a negative opinion

210
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,310
about him on the other hand though it

211
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,020
may seem incredible given all the

212
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,150
scandals the former presidents data are

213
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,520
actually somewhat better but not that

214
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,320
much in our case the negative opinion

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,210
score is 76 percent but now with the

216
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,400
arrival of our Berta Fernanda things are

217
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,320
different the new candidates is less

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,150
tainted than the former presidents

219
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,130
Ginobili with Australian where the

220
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,950
single cashier from latina Brazilian

221
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,210
territory consider cosas para C&F taught

222
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,470
Maharaja Tina so you know Alberto

223
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,360
Fernandez in a figure income is

224
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,220
potential parallel economy para la vida

225
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,220
hinge so the third and most important

226
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,140
question based on what we've seen would

227
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,030
be or consequences with the victory of a

228
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,410
birthday Fernandez and Cristina

229
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,570
Fernandez de Kirchner have and some more

230
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,200
kind of public policies would they bet

231
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,880
[Music]

232
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,620
well it turns out we don't even have to

233
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,300
wait until October to start answering

234
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,459
you see the mere fact the CashNet became

235
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,410
a favorite in the polls has already made

236
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,690
all international investors very very

237
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,399
nervous and really perhaps we should be

238
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,540
just saying that it's made them even

239
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,579
more nervous than they already were and

240
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,860
that has translated into the new drop of

241
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,420
the peso against the dollar this may

242
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,490
also have fuelled the idea of this new

243
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,860
and surprising formula so why so much

244
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,690
nervousness it was assumed that

245
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,730
Christina's return to power would mean a

246
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,380
return to these same ultra

247
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,510
interventionalist policies and tons of

248
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,910
public spending as in the previous stage

249
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,529
okay so Macri he didn't lead any great

250
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,480
change either but if Christina returned

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,760
any possibility of Argentina changing

252
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
and don't tell me it doesn't need to

253
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,100
change we simply go out of the window

254
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,860
[Music]

255
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,480
the simple facts the Kirchner took the

256
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,519
lead in the polls fueled investors fear

257
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,010
of a new and upcoming Argentine default

258
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,990
and that makes things even worse to such

259
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,880
an extent that even some analysts such

260
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,100
as Carlos Malamud have warns of a

261
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,079
forthcoming exchange run that is the

262
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,399
peso will sink even more because

263
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,050
everyone will want to get rid of the

264
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,640
currency he thinks this is gonna happen

265
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,070
if Kirchner ISM continues to improve its

266
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:50,190
chances of getting back into power in

267
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,779
any case regardless of whether Macri

268
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,850
wins or loses the elections Argentina's

269
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,130
current situation is complicated the

270
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,209
government will have to return a

271
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,940
whopping thirty four billion dollars in

272
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,800
2020 in a context of a severe economic

273
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,260
recession and with a peso that is

274
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,680
depreciating full-speed Argentina is at

275
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,199
a crossroads its debt in dollars is huge

276
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,880
accounting for almost 90 percent of the

277
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,649
GDP a figure that won't stop increasing

278
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,660
due to the pesos collapse the more the

279
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,640
peso Falls the greater the burden of

280
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,260
debt in dollars for the Argentine

281
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,120
economy the probability that Argentina

282
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,680
will not succeed in paying this debt

283
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,429
within one presidential term is high

284
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,809
yes the probability of default is high

285
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,869
but it isn't a fact the situation is not

286
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,999
yet irreversible unfortunately it seems

287
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,529
that almost all political leaders are

288
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,149
clear on this the fact that Christina

289
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:41,459
has decided to run as vice president in

290
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,409
Alberta Fernandez's candidacy could be a

291
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:45,149
good test after all as we've already

292
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,739
seen Alberta fen and death was very

293
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,449
critical of Cristina Fernandez

294
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,999
management however Argentina does need a

295
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:56,279
total change of course and to be frank

296
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,169
Alberta Fernanda he doesn't seem so

297
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,269
committed to leading that change given

298
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:02,549
his current running mate is the former

299
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,129
presidents and this is what leads us to

300
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,679
this video's main question will the new

301
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,199
governments be it Macri Fernandez or any

302
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:12,239
other candidate be willing to carry out

303
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,129
that massive change well leave your
