00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
guys this video and all of our videos

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,179
they're possible because of great

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,220
sponsors for this channel like Dollar

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,899
Shave Club if you want to support us

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,550
Dollar Shave Club is one of the easiest

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,679
and best ways that you can do that and

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,049
I'll only cost you five dollars now I

8
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:14,820
don't use Dollar Shave Club on my face

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,000
obviously but I do use it on my head and

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,340
it's fantastic I used to use those cheap

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,320
razors you know the kind of one or two

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,720
blade blue plastic horrible things that

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,580
you get in the store because I didn't

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,050
want to pay the super expensive prices

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,480
and I guess it kind of works when you're

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,520
doing your face maybe not very well but

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,390
at least you're not gonna cut yourself

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,070
horribly if you're shaving your head

19
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,200
Dollar Shave god it's even better than

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,340
when you're shaving your face which is

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,140
why it's perfect for me but it's you

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,280
know if you're just shaving your face

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,559
like a normal person you can grow hair

24
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,270
then that's fantastic

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,739
get Dollar Shave Club and he may see

26
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:47,940
anything about Dollar Shave Club is that

27
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,770
it is five dollars to get started and

28
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,719
basically what that means is that you

29
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,670
get amazing quality but it doesn't come

30
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,800
with a crazy price tag I mean like I

31
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,329
said no one wants to buy those super

32
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,859
crazy expensive razors that you get at

33
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,109
the store I still go in there and wonder

34
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,239
who buys that stuff so for that five

35
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,710
dollars you get an executive raise you

36
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,530
get three tubes of shaving stuff a scrub

37
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,040
shaving butter and a post shave do ya

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,930
they also have an oral kit and a shower

39
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,790
kit which are just five dollars each as

40
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,850
well the toothbrush is great I about my

41
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,670
previous one the bristles is that what

42
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,960
you call them we're all like this and

43
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,549
now I have a nice new one which is

44
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,200
fantastic it's a solid piece of kit

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,990
shower stuff is also great as well but

46
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,189
you know as a man with a lot of hair to

47
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,229
shave the razors are really where it is

48
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,270
at for me so if you're looking to get

49
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,340
started get the razors get the other

50
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,570

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,290
about supporting visual politic in some

54
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,240
way or another Dollar Shave Club is a

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,759
fantastic and easy way to do that let's

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,750
get into it shall we

57
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,300
[Applause]

58
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,510
[Music]

59
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,650
all right so the million-dollar question

60
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,560
why is Europe not growing I mean think

61
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
about it the European Union has the

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,010
second largest economy on the planet

63
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,420
just after the United States

64
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,850
nevertheless of the world's 50 largest

65
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,940
companies only eight come from European

66
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,780
soil

67
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,080
[Music]

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,060
while the New York Stock Exchange's on

69
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,190
fire European stock markets are going

70
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,680
down this includes Frankfurt Paris and

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,260
Madrid and what about the tech giants

72
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,910
we've all heard of Google Apple and

73
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,280
Amazon to name a few but what's there

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,770
EU equivalents well Germany has s AP

75
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,450
which is a database software company

76
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,790
Sweden has Spotify but let's face it

77
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,830
none of these are really a match for

78
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,810
Facebook or for uber and this is

79
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,910
especially worrisome if we consider the

80
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,400
entire world is on the rise yep

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
dear viewer if we take the GDP of all of

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,880
the countries on the planet including

83
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,150
the wealthy and the poor ones we have a

84
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,160
3.1 percent growth rate this is great

85
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,810
news for everybody but the Europeans

86
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,390
growth rate it hardly reaches 2.5

87
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,600
percent and believe me this is not good

88
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,730
for Europeans slower growth means less

89
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,250
jobs and less money for everybody at the

90
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,450
end of the day if an American or a

91
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,310
Chinese company can take on the market

92
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,650
sooner or later European firms will soon

93
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,930
go bankrupt so you know good luck

94
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,970
finding a well-paid job this is why many

95
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,040
politicians believe the EU has to bet on

96
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,080
bigger companies and it's in this

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,330
context that we found this headline from

98
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,959
the beginning of 2019 EU blocks Alstom

99
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,780
Siemens rail merger due to serious

100
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,450
competition concerns to summarize Alstom

101
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,459
is a French high-speed train

102
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,870
manufacturer have you ever seen those

103
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,209
French TJ vs those trains that appear in

104
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,709
movies like Mission Impossible well

105
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:45,570
those were manufactured by alstom

106
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,370
Siemens is on the other hands is a

107
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,500
German bear moth with a train

108
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,209
manufacturing division had they been

109
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,739
merged they would have become the second

110
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,880
largest train company on the planet

111
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,520
[Music]

112
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,770
and you might be wondering well what's

113
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,570
the first well of course that would be a

114
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,760
Chinese company so again Europe wants to

115
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,770
compete with China in terms of

116
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,000
technology so now you might be wondering

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,060
well why did they ban the merger this is

118
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,410
where we get to one of the oldest

119
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,780
economic dilemmas the foundation of free

120
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,209
markets is free competition this means

121
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,340
that if multiple companies compete for

122
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,290
customers they will end up offering

123
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,360
better goods and services at a lower

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,430
price now what happens when a company

125
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,520
becomes so large that it can smash the

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,430
rest well then we have a monopoly for

127
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,080
example let's say that Alstom and

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,910
siemens merged at this moment in time

129
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,710
the Spanish government wants to buy new

130
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,390
high-speed trains well if there's only

131
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,040
one company capable of meeting these

132
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,990
high standards well why would that

133
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,210
company lower their price at the end of

134
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,130
the day they're the only choice on

135
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,080
European soil and that's at all if this

136
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,910
company could take all the contracts

137
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,770
well what would be the incentive for

138
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,780
other entrepreneurs to compete in the

139
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,640
Train industry in other words it would

140
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,770
be the opposite of a free market on the

141
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,150
other hand we can argue that if two

142
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,060
companies want to merge who is the EU to

143
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,220
say no to that that doesn't sound like a

144
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,500
very free-market thing either

145
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,660
[Music]

146
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,490
as you can see this is a bit of a

147
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,350
dilemma it's also one of the biggest

148
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,260
ideological debates of our time this is

149
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,670
not the classical fight between

150
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,310
socialism versus capitalism in fact we

151
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,290
can say that this is a fight between two

152
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,600
different views on capitalism we're

153
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,430
gonna say that this is French capitalism

154
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,860
versus German capitalism so now the

155
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,050
question is what was it a good idea to

156
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,840
block the Siemens Alstom merger then

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,460
what's the difference between French and

158
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,530
German capitalism and does Europe really

159
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,080
need these big companies well today we

160
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,130
are going to answer all of these

161
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,170
questions but before we do let's take a

162
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,870
look back at the history

163
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,240
French capitalism versus German

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,770
capitalism if you've been following

165
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,360
visual politics for a long time you

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,190
might remember this video that we made

167
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,050
about France France is a country famous

168
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,480
for croissants baguettes and economic to

169
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,430
reach ISM since the times of Chartres

170
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,800
gall French capitalism has worked like

171
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,190
an army

172
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,750
of course they have private companies

173
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,580
and somehow competition among them but

174
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,320
for decades the French economic playbook

175
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,180
said that the government's must help and

176
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,550
promote their big corporations this is

177
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,140
why starting a company in this country

178
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,510
can be as hard as you could imagine but

179
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,370
hey if you're a big company while the

180
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,510
state's gonna roll out the red carpet

181
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,890
for you if I could you remember this

182
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,180
list with the world's 50 biggest

183
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,280
companies so from those 80 European

184
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,560
companies and three are French and this

185
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,580
is not by chance

186
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,050
german capitalism it's the opposite of

187
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,240
course germany has regulations and taxes

188
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
but the aim of those is to protect a

189
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,380
greater good the environment labor

190
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,300
rights or competition how about an

191
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,430
example let's talk about economic policy

192
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,830
if you remember in this other video we

193
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,229
explained how Germany is totally against

194
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,270
nuclear power and how they're closing

195
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,260
all of their plants

196
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,970
this means that producing energy in this

197
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,800
country is very expensive but on the

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
other hand no other country relies more

199
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,910
on nuclear plants than France does

200
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,770
theoretically this would mean that the

201
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,360
energy bills here should be way cheaper

202
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,270
than those in Germany right well

203
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,310
actually not at all if you check out

204
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,650
expat Aston calm you'll see that if you

205
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,240
lived in Paris you would pay about the

206
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,550
same as living in Munich which is one of

207
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,500
the most expensive German cities why

208
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,570
well because of things like this french

209
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,510
consumer groups is EDF monopoly boosts

210
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,770
power prices

211
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,780
the truth is Germany has a lot of energy

212
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,430
companies competing on the same playing

213
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,979
field nobody has the government as a

214
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,449
shareholder all right so there is

215
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,820
actually a small exception here which

216
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,740
would be Eon but we're talking only

217
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,930
about 2% of the capital held by a

218
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,000
regional government the rest of the

219
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,979
companies they're fully state free they

220
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,750
also have no privileges whatsoever

221
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,949
France though that's a different animal

222
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,120
here they have a big fair mouth called

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,190
EDF 70 percent of their capital is owned

224
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,300
by the French government

225
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,919
this means a big helping hands from the

226
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,419
government in almost monopolistic

227
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,850
conditions of course it's not all bad

228
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,889
thanks to its public support EDF is the

229
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,660
world's third largest company in their

230
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,550
industry they've also got a big foothold

231
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,289
in other countries including African

232
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,699
ones the price of having such a big

233
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,830
company that's paid for by the French

234
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,250
consumers the same goes for other

235
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,070
industries as well for example

236
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,250
automobiles

237
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,500
France has to juggernauts Reynaud and

238
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,979
Fujio acetone that got merged some years

239
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,599
ago many of you might think that these

240
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,610
are horrible companies that compete on

241
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,339
free market right well this isn't quite

242
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,120
the case

243
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,459
see in both cases the French government

244
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,769
is one of the main shareholders Marino's

245
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,649
case the French government owns 15% of

246
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,279
the company

247
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,319
this means a nice little financial

248
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,110
cushion for Reynaud coming straight from

249
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,819
the taxpayers pocket thanks to this

250
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,379
renault starts from an advantageous

251
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,899
position compared with other car makers

252
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,050
but not only that having so many shares

253
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,059
the government can intervene directly in

254
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,980
the company's affairs for example paris

255
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,660
would never allow renault to fall into

256
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,220
foreign hands many times the government

257
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,379
is vetoed the closure of factories or is

258
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:19,720
given grants to develop new car models

259
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,850
so well now let's hop over and have a

260
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,379
look at what happened in germany in this

261
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,269
case the german government has no stocks

262
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,120
in any car maker BMW for example is

263
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,740
completely in private hands

264
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,629
Volkswagen they're partially owned by a

265
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,709
city hall but it's completely

266
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,569
independent from the central government

267
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,279
this means that Germany doesn't help any

268
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,110
of their companies at least in theory

269
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,910
and something similar happens in the

270
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,129
Nordic countries this is why we can find

271
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:48,129
headlines like this one ely holding

272
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,620
pleats acquisition of shares in a b

273
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,629
Volvo in this case Volvo is one of the

274
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,279
biggest companies in Sweden and Geney

275
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,259
Holdings is a Chinese group the Swedish

276
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,519
government did nothing to stop this

277
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,410
acquisition but good luck trying to do

278
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,970
the same thing in France it's not that

279
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,679
they have lots of regulations against

280
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,089
foreign investment it's just that the

281
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,470
fact that if Volvo were French they

282
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,600
would be surely owned by the governments

283
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,699
and the government let that happen but

284
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,529
if you want to see French versus German

285
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,569
capitalism in action well pay attention

286
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:17,750
to today's story let's have a look

287
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,390
[Music]

288
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,430
juggernaut on Rails by the way this

289
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,170
amazing tune you're listening to now is

290
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,970
from hard bone a German hard rock fans

291
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,830
that sent us their music

292
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,500
[Music]

293
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,630
the zone we're playing right now is

294
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,430
cooled no-man's land there was a time

295
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,920
when China was a corporate no-man's land

296
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,590
the country was growing like gangbusters

297
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,200
they needed roads bridges and trains

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,910
they didn't have companies to build

299
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,520
those this is why in 2004 it signed a

300
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,170
big contract with Siemens to build

301
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,890
high-speed trains the Chinese can

302
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,320
negotiate like nobody else one of the

303
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,270
conditions was that next to the German

304
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,040
engineers there would be Chinese ones

305
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,380
learning from them so well what was the

306
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,120
conclusion Chinese people learned how to

307
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,790
make high-speed trains no surprise years

308
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,650
later Siemens ended the contract and

309
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,720
China got what they wanted technology

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,400
with this technology they created their

311
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,070
own company see our RC and this was not

312
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,900
a normal company it soon became the

313
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,120
biggest company in its industry

314
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,270
worldwide see ah see the Chinese rail

315
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,920
juggernaut Europe is afraid of the

316
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,050
corporation brought in about 26 billion

317
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,890
euros in revenue in 2017 and size really

318
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,570
matters in the corporate world with all

319
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,490
this money you see RC can make big

320
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,590
investments and smash their competitors

321
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,060
they've already won big contracts in

322
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,670
America Serbia and the Czech Republic so

323
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,230
what does a French person think when

324
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,320
they face a foreign competitor well they

325
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,610
think this Germany Siemens

326
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,190
Frances Austin emerged to create new

327
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,830
European rail champion the new company

328
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,690
was meant to be the second largest in

329
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,820
the world and you might wonder well

330
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,380
where did they used to have their

331
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,840
headquarters and oh what a question well

332
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,090
obviously it's in Paris I mean where

333
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,770
else so everybody was happy the

334
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,120
shareholders the French government and

335
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,220
also the German governments yep in this

336
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,200
story the German government was pretty

337
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,820
much in agreement with the French one so

338
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,830
well where is the problem the problem

339
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,950
was in the antitrust laws basically if

340
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,540
two big companies merge they need

341
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,790
special authorisation in Europe the

342
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,800
limit to determine what is big and what

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,840
is not is five billion euros of gross

344
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,990
income and 250 million euros in income

345
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,030
within Europe if the company that comes

346
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,280
out of the merger surpasses those limits

347
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,570
then they need to ask for permission

348
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,880
from the European Commission which is

349
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,080
sort of the executive power in Europe

350
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,910
and this is where our friends from

351
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,370
Alstom Siemens had to face this woman

352
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,279
Marguerite for Sega also known as the

353
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,610
trust Buster vestige IRS's no to Siemens

354
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,070
Alstom mega merger is the EU

355
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,630
commissioner for competition something

356
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,790
like the Minister for regulating big

357
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,769
corporations it is my being Danish we

358
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,510
can see that vesta in this story

359
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,579
represents german capitalism her

360
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:15,230
argument was that Alstom Siemens would

361
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,519
be big enough to smash the small

362
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,839
competitors don't forget that we're

363
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,040
talking about the very political

364
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,779
industry where most of the contracts are

365
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:22,490
paid for by different governments so

366
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,500
imagine who would win all of the public

367
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,320
contracts in Germany and France and well

368
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,080
this is where the big dilemma started

369
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,109
[Applause]

370
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:35,779
French economy minister Bruno Lima has

371
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,269
vividly defended the intended merger

372
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:40,579
between European train manufacturers

373
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:44,929
Alstom France and Siemens Germany the EU

374
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:47,539
refusing a merger would be a big

375
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:50,509
economical and political mistake as you

376
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:52,249
can imagine both the French and German

377
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,509
governments had been lobbying in

378
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:55,039
Brussels as much as they could in order

379
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,689
to make this merger happen their train

380
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,039
of thought was that the Chinese might

381
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,509
end up manufacturing all of the European

382
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,259
trains

383
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,659
festa instead insisted that the best way

384
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,399
to face Chinese competitors is with

385
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,929
innovation and the best way to boost

386
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,729
innovation is to have lots of smaller

387
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:10,009
companies competing with each other so

388
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:11,959

391
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:16,639
that Europe needs to create big

corporate juggernauts to face foreign
