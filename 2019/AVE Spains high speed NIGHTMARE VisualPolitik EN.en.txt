92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,519

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,620
as a quick side note here the influence

this point the question we really have

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,020
is this can such a huge public

151
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,970
investment be justified because it helps

152
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,770
a few private companies do increase

153

their competitiveness but more about

154
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,730

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,090

advantage of this crowded calendar to

172
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,080
give Spain's international image a bit

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,819

self as a modern thriving prosperous

175
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,629

176
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:18,520
trains were one of the government's best

177
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,770

178
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,020

192
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,189
perhaps the fact that the president of

193
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:58,870
the government was from Sibel law audit

194
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,370
and Alicia was a stronghold of the

195
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,870
Socialist Party it was more of a

196
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,520
deciding factor than the economic

197
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,830
exploitation criteria you know how

198
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,710
politicians are the fact is they're

199
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,960
finally after an investment of just over

200
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,150
5 billion euros in today's value what I

201
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,339

and since then yabai has not stopped

206
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,290
growing financed by the spanish taxpayer

207
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,730
and by europeans who have contributed

208
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,250
millions if not billions in grants to

209
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,850

the fact is that it's been almost 30

214
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,530
years since the line was first

215
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,300
inaugurated more than enough time to

216
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,460
review the facts so how successful it

217
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,470
has Spain's high-speed project beam well

218
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,380
you know arts Houston rather Madrid we

219
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,000
have a problem Spain's experience has

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,710
been very different from Japan's so

221
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:02,720
let's take a look a flightless bird

222
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,290
[Music]

223
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,080
la is a faithful reflection of how

224
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,510
politicians often perform results are an

225
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,040
afterthought Spain's high-speed train

226
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,690
has grown a lot in extension of

227
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,520
infrastructure but not so much in

228
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,650
passenger volumes the result is that

229
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,510
today the Spanish high-speed network is

230
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,130
one of the most underused networks in

231
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,930
the world

232
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,170
[Music]

233
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,420
the network is used so little that its

234
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,369
profitability report is plagued with

235
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:40,359
many red numbers in fact the company

236
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,129
that manages the infrastructure loses

237
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,410
hundreds of millions of euros every

238
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,660
single year just maintaining and

239
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,160
operating the network currently there

240
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,509
isn't a single line that can be

241
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:55,990
justified from an economic perspective

242
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,100
the are they high-speed railways

243
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,480
especially though is designed to go over

244
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,569
300 km/h are very expensive to build and

245
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:08,959
very expensive to maintain and the

246
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,790
results as you can see should make

247
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,100
Spanish politicians blush with this data

248
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,649
in hand it's clear that no line in Spain

249
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:22,519
will ever be profitable according to

250
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,290
studies made by independent foundations

251
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,940
such as for DES and none of Spain's

252
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,889
high-speed networks beneficial not even

253
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,630
if they factor in social profitability

254
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,610
that is to say even if they save time on

255
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,949
traffic jams or displacements not even

256
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:39,119
when you count that are they properly

257
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,379
in fact some of the lines even have

258
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,660
negative social impact returns it's all

259
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,440
pretty crazy

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,589
[Music]

261
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,330
and if we include financial data money

262
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,880
that goes in and out the cold hard cash

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,100
then most of the lines will not only

264
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,839
never recover the investments made they

265
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,330
won't even cover their operating costs

266
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,940
[Music]

267
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,530
in other words this is a hole that

268
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,020
swallows tens of billions of euros and

269
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,580
Spain is going to have to keep paying

270
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,470
this for decades and that's not even the

271
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,300
worst of it the worst part is that many

272
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,590
of the lines that are currently under

273
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,390
construction will have an even more

274
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,520
disastrous future

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,450
[Music]

276
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,190
let me explain an the most attractive

277
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,080
lines have already been built and now

278
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,820
this infrastructure is being taken to

279
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,830
regions that don't have the basic

280
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,480
characteristics that a high-speed train

281
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,460
requires that is areas with high

282
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,840
population density high economic

283
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,010
activity and high purchasing power

284
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,630
Spain's arm a network is expanding

285
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,280
towards territories that don't meet any

286
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,800
of these criteria so future losses of

287
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,240
the network are just going to be much

288
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,710
greater a high-speed railway as Japan is

289
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,110
shown can be useful infrastructure but

290
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,330
only if it's approached with a rational

291
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,520
economic set of criteria otherwise it

292
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,860
can create a huge hole in the public

293
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,110
coffers the heavy burden on current and

294
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,500
future taxpayers

295
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,710
[Music]

296
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,820
while it's true that public

297
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,890
infrastructure can help create wealth if

298
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,260
it isn't executed based on feasibility

299
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,390
criteria it can have the opposite effect

300
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,490
what is good for a politician's campaign

301
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,590
isn't necessarily good for the citizens

302
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,390
and in this case things are they is a

303
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,640
prime example

304
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,290
[Music]

305
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,370
enormous investments in the alley

306
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,500
network has led Spain to neglect lines

307
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,300
used for moving goods but the positive

308
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,460
impacts on both the environments and the

309
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,050
competitiveness of Spanish companies

310
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,670
would be improved by replacing the

311
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,070
transport of goods by Road and bringing

312
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,990
it back to rail however instead what we

313
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,110
find a news stories like this one Spain

314
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,240
the new country that moves the least

315
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,180
Goods by train the Spain only moves 1.4

316
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,280
percent of its goods by train in fact in

317
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,660
the u.s. at the bottom of the list

318
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,670
barely beating countries like Luxembourg

319
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,190
Ireland or Greece it was quite a mess

320
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,460
really so why do politicians keep

321
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,800
focusing so much on high-speed rail well

322
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,810
I guess that's just because opening new

323
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,910
lines is pretty popular anyway that's

324
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,890
the reality of the Spanish high-speed

325
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,420
network but now it's your turn what

326
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,340
