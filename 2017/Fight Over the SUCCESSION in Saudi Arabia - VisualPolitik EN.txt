[Music]

3
00:00:06.71 --> 00:00:10.920
we told you in a previous video how

4
00:00:08.82 --> 00:00:13.259
Saudi Arabia wants to leave behind once

5
00:00:10.92 --> 00:00:15.389
and for all its addiction to oil and

6
00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.640
become a nation similar to dubai or abu

7
00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.830
dhabi in this video we're going to look

8
00:00:17.64 --> 00:00:22.109
at the country in more depth in order to

9
00:00:19.83 --> 00:00:29.400
get an idea of just how this mission to

10
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:32.160
get free from oil is going the thing is

11
00:00:29.4 --> 00:00:34.559
there is a specific name a leader behind

12
00:00:32.16 --> 00:00:36.630
this ambitious plan and my question to

13
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
you is do you know who this person is

14
00:00:36.63 --> 00:00:40.649
well for those of you don't the person

15
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.200
who is turning everything upside down in

16
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.360
Saudi Arabia is Mohammed bin Salman but

17
00:00:46.2 --> 00:00:50.070
my name alone it doesn't explain much so

18
00:00:48.36 --> 00:00:52.770
now you might be wondering who is this

19
00:00:50.07 --> 00:00:55.170
man really what are his intentions and

20
00:00:52.77 --> 00:00:56.370
what exactly is he trying to do well

21
00:00:55.17 --> 00:00:58.350
these are the questions that we're going

22
00:00:56.37 --> 00:01:01.050
to the answering in today's visual

23
00:00:58.35 --> 00:01:01.260
politic video so let's get started shall

24
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:07.680
we

25
00:01:01.26 --> 00:01:09.150
a prince of change might only be a

26
00:01:07.68 --> 00:01:11.280
little more than 30 years old but

27
00:01:09.15 --> 00:01:13.350
Mohammed bin Salman is already one of

28
00:01:11.28 --> 00:01:15.930
the most powerful people in the world

29
00:01:13.35 --> 00:01:18.540
and he controls more money than we could

30
00:01:15.93 --> 00:01:20.369
ever possibly count formerly well he is

31
00:01:18.54 --> 00:01:21.720
the Minister of Defence deputy Crown

32
00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.150
Prince second deputy prime minister

33
00:01:21.72 --> 00:01:25.619
chief of the Royal quarter hands chair

34
00:01:24.15 --> 00:01:28.170
of the Council for economic and

35
00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.630
development affairs so what does all of

36
00:01:28.17 --> 00:01:33.299
this mean well it kind of means the

37
00:01:30.63 --> 00:01:36.420
Bahamas bin Salman is in control of

38
00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.369
wealth everything he's got complete

39
00:01:36.42 --> 00:01:40.020
control over the country's oil over the

40
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.939
massive financial reserves that have

41
00:01:40.02 --> 00:01:44.310
been accumulated over the years and also

42
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.979
over Saudi Arabia's massive defense

43
00:01:44.31 --> 00:01:51.119
budget so today the power of the prince

44
00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.979
is practically total and say well this

45
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.200
isn't something normal either never have

46
00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.240
such a young man had so much power

47
00:01:55.2 --> 00:01:59.189
before up until now the norm was for the

48
00:01:57.24 --> 00:02:01.409
country to be controlled by seniors of

49
00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.740
80 or more years who were very reluctant

50
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.270
to go for any kind of change but all of

51
00:02:04.74 --> 00:02:08.250
a sudden changes on the first because

52
00:02:06.27 --> 00:02:10.800
what Mohammed bin Salman is trying to do

53
00:02:08.25 --> 00:02:13.500
with Saudi Arabia is turn it into a new

54
00:02:10.8 --> 00:02:15.450
United Arab Emirates a country which the

55
00:02:13.5 --> 00:02:17.520
prince has an enormous amount of

56
00:02:15.45 --> 00:02:19.080
admiration for later we're going to see

57
00:02:17.52 --> 00:02:21.450
just how he is doing this but for now

58
00:02:19.08 --> 00:02:24.030
you need to bear something in mind the

59
00:02:21.45 --> 00:02:26.459
use of the country cheer bin Salman as

60
00:02:24.03 --> 00:02:28.470
the savior of the kingdom and this is a

61
00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.290
country where half of its population is

62
00:02:28.47 --> 00:02:33.720
less than 25 years old and so in a

63
00:02:31.29 --> 00:02:35.610
country like that it's pretty important

64
00:02:33.72 --> 00:02:37.890
but then anyway be wondering why does

65
00:02:35.61 --> 00:02:40.890
this man come from how can such a young

66
00:02:37.89 --> 00:02:41.190
man have so much power well he's the son

67
00:02:40.89 --> 00:02:45.750
of the

68
00:02:41.19 --> 00:02:47.520
current king last way just a second

69
00:02:45.75 --> 00:02:49.920
before you explain well of course he is

70
00:02:47.52 --> 00:02:52.170
because you need to know that being the

71
00:02:49.92 --> 00:02:54.570
son of the king in Saudi Arabia wasn't

72
00:02:52.17 --> 00:02:56.880
always such an important thing in fact

73
00:02:54.57 --> 00:03:01.860
for now then samal is not even the heir

74
00:02:56.88 --> 00:03:05.400
to the Saudi throne the battle over the

75
00:03:01.86 --> 00:03:07.410
throne Salman bin Abdulaziz is the king

76
00:03:05.4 --> 00:03:09.120
of Saudi Arabia he is the son of the man

77
00:03:07.41 --> 00:03:11.880
who is considered the founder of the

78
00:03:09.12 --> 00:03:14.340
country Abdul Aziz bin Saud well since

79
00:03:11.88 --> 00:03:17.400
Sal died in 1953 the kingdom has been

80
00:03:14.34 --> 00:03:20.190
inherited by brother dr. brother dual

81
00:03:17.4 --> 00:03:22.380
Aziz bin Saud had seventeen known wives

82
00:03:20.19 --> 00:03:24.570
and it is calculated that he also had

83
00:03:22.38 --> 00:03:27.180
around thirty two sons so there were

84
00:03:24.57 --> 00:03:28.500
quite a few potential heirs the thing is

85
00:03:27.18 --> 00:03:30.300
but when the current king here is

86
00:03:28.5 --> 00:03:32.970
believed to be the 25th son reached

87
00:03:30.3 --> 00:03:35.070
power a few years ago in 2015 the first

88
00:03:32.97 --> 00:03:36.570
thing he did was change the laws of

89
00:03:35.07 --> 00:03:38.340
succession even though some of his

90
00:03:36.57 --> 00:03:40.350
brothers are still alive he has decided

91
00:03:38.34 --> 00:03:42.150
to put the new generations in charge of

92
00:03:40.35 --> 00:03:43.920
this process to do this he has decided

93
00:03:42.15 --> 00:03:45.959
to appoint his nephew Muhammad bin Nayef

94
00:03:43.92 --> 00:03:47.730
who is closer to Washington than others

95
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.040
and he has been in charge of security

96
00:03:47.73 --> 00:03:51.870
for the last few years as well as Secret

97
00:03:50.04 --> 00:03:54.099
Service's and the fight against

98
00:03:51.87 --> 00:03:56.200
fundamentalism

99
00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.180
however it seems like young Mohammed bin

100
00:03:56.2 --> 00:03:59.920
Salman the main character in this video

101
00:03:58.18 --> 00:04:02.049
it seems he's not very happy about that

102
00:03:59.92 --> 00:04:04.030
and it seems that he is taking aim at

103
00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.189
the throne he wants to be the future

104
00:04:04.03 --> 00:04:08.019
king of Saudi Arabia so his eagerness

105
00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.389
for reforms could be explained as an

106
00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.370
attempt to gain popularity in fact that

107
00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:15.370
is what most analysts currently think

108
00:04:12.37 --> 00:04:16.840
that means well it does make sense the

109
00:04:15.37 --> 00:04:18.549
fall of the price of oil has given

110
00:04:16.84 --> 00:04:20.229
Mohammed bin Salman the opportunity to

111
00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.479
aim for the throne which is something

112
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.669
needs father obviously support if sound

113
00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.169
vision 2030 starts showing good result

114
00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.449
in Salman will be in a better position

115
00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.250
to ask for a reward and become

116
00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.889
potentially the new heir to the throne

117
00:04:30.25 --> 00:04:34.630
however there are a few problems on the

118
00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.190
road ahead though for then some are as

119
00:04:34.63 --> 00:04:37.840
well as the country on the one hand

120
00:04:36.19 --> 00:04:39.970
there are problems inside the royal

121
00:04:37.84 --> 00:04:41.229
family bin Salman has made a lot of

122
00:04:39.97 --> 00:04:42.160
enemies who accuse him of being

123
00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.810
power-hungry

124
00:04:42.16 --> 00:04:46.240
on the other hand his father the current

125
00:04:43.81 --> 00:04:49.320
king is quite old 81 years and he seems

126
00:04:46.24 --> 00:04:49.320
to have some memory issues

127
00:04:49.49 --> 00:04:53.060
so this means that there are two

128
00:04:51.05 --> 00:04:54.410
possible scenarios ahead if the current

129
00:04:53.06 --> 00:04:55.910
king lives for many more years the

130
00:04:54.41 --> 00:04:57.830
prince in someone will be able to

131
00:04:55.91 --> 00:04:59.300
consolidate his power however if the

132
00:04:57.83 --> 00:05:01.099
King doesn't live so long the current

133
00:04:59.3 --> 00:05:03.530
head in someone's cousin could become

134
00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:08.990
the new king and wish goodbye both to

135
00:05:03.53 --> 00:05:10.789
the prince and his saudi vision 2013 as

136
00:05:08.99 --> 00:05:12.800
the reality is is that this is how

137
00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.360
monarchies work but I'm pretty sure that

138
00:05:12.8 --> 00:05:16.610
some of you by now are probably thinking

139
00:05:14.36 --> 00:05:18.229
well this is all fascinating Simon that

140
00:05:16.61 --> 00:05:20.930
why should I care what happens in Saudi

141
00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.949
Arabia well you should care and probably

142
00:05:20.93 --> 00:05:24.410
more than you think

143
00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.389
Saudi Arabia is still the biggest oil

144
00:05:24.41 --> 00:05:28.729
producer and it is also the most

145
00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.660
important and influential country in the

146
00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.709
Arab world

147
00:05:30.66 --> 00:05:33.709
[Music]

148
00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.669
and through the Lucian towards openness

149
00:05:35.93 --> 00:05:40.009
for this country could be something very

150
00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.020
positive for the world can spinel the

151
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.120
planned salary vision 2030 it seems to

152
00:05:42.02 --> 00:05:46.550
be the only opportunity for the country

153
00:05:44.12 --> 00:05:48.499
to progress and the involved but now

154
00:05:46.55 --> 00:05:56.469
that we've said that what exactly is the

155
00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:58.909
plan for this country incorrigibles

156
00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.949
so far in today's story we've seen a

157
00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.990
handsome prince and they battle over the

158
00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.810
throne but we need a third ingredient

159
00:06:02.99 --> 00:06:08.300
for this Saudi soap opera and that's

160
00:06:05.81 --> 00:06:10.310
luxury and money well of all the royal

161
00:06:08.3 --> 00:06:12.469
families in the world the South the

162
00:06:10.31 --> 00:06:14.599
royal household of Saudi Arabia might be

163
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:17.000
the most addicted to money and luxury

164
00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.680
and well now you're going to see why as

165
00:06:17.0 --> 00:06:20.750
we have mentioned in several videos the

166
00:06:18.68 --> 00:06:23.300
full of oil prices has jeopardized many

167
00:06:20.75 --> 00:06:26.330
countries and among them is Saudi Arabia

168
00:06:23.3 --> 00:06:28.339
only in 2016 and even though many

169
00:06:26.33 --> 00:06:30.050
adjustments were made the country had a

170
00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.409
deficit of more than eighty billion

171
00:06:30.05 --> 00:06:35.810
dollars and now the question becomes

172
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.569
what can we do in order to fix such a

173
00:06:35.81 --> 00:06:39.949
hole in their budget well in 2016 the

174
00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.169
Saudi government announced that the

175
00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.550
country was going to go on a diet sowing

176
00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.669
for the first time in decades

177
00:06:43.55 --> 00:06:48.889
austerity reached Saudi Arabia the

178
00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.199
government of bin Salman started with

179
00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.029
reductions in public wages canceled many

180
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.250
projects whose profitability was

181
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.899
uncertain reduced subsidies and gasoline

182
00:06:55.25 --> 00:06:58.899
water electricity

183
00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.300
yeah

184
00:07:05.99 --> 00:07:10.910
this was a pretty huge shock all of the

185
00:07:08.54 --> 00:07:12.860
most subsidised economies in the world I

186
00:07:10.91 --> 00:07:15.380
mean up until now their view oil it

187
00:07:12.86 --> 00:07:16.730
helps pay for everything in Saudi Arabia

188
00:07:15.38 --> 00:07:18.700
however hold on for just a moment

189
00:07:16.73 --> 00:07:21.680
because well that's not the whole story

190
00:07:18.7 --> 00:07:23.660
under Solomon's rule princes still enjoy

191
00:07:21.68 --> 00:07:26.090
many material privileges the

192
00:07:23.66 --> 00:07:29.000
subsidization system hasn't changed for

193
00:07:26.09 --> 00:07:30.950
the royal household take a look at this

194
00:07:29.0 --> 00:07:33.080
the king of Saudi Arabia has ultra

195
00:07:30.95 --> 00:07:35.210
luxurious palaces all over the world

196
00:07:33.08 --> 00:07:37.580
that are available to him in Marbella in

197
00:07:35.21 --> 00:07:40.600
Spain he has el rocío a palace inspired

198
00:07:37.58 --> 00:07:43.060
by no less than the White House

199
00:07:40.6 --> 00:07:45.290
[Music]

200
00:07:43.06 --> 00:07:47.180
but I mean it's got to be pretty boring

201
00:07:45.29 --> 00:07:49.730
right have to go to the same Palace all

202
00:07:47.18 --> 00:07:51.200
the time I mean how tiresome so lost

203
00:07:49.73 --> 00:07:53.570
some of the King built a new and

204
00:07:51.2 --> 00:07:55.820
gigantic Palace in Tangier in Morocco

205
00:07:53.57 --> 00:07:57.470
the palace has it's very own hospital

206
00:07:55.82 --> 00:07:59.990
and here the King gets French seafood

207
00:07:57.47 --> 00:08:01.580
delivered direct from France but I mean

208
00:07:59.99 --> 00:08:03.290
hey what's the problem with chartering a

209
00:08:01.58 --> 00:08:05.870
few airplanes so the king can eat some

210
00:08:03.29 --> 00:08:07.820
nice lobsters right oh and by the way

211
00:08:05.87 --> 00:08:11.510
when the king of Saudi Arabia travels

212
00:08:07.82 --> 00:08:14.090
they traveled big in his last tour

213
00:08:11.51 --> 00:08:16.970
around Asia in 2016 the king traveled

214
00:08:14.09 --> 00:08:19.640
with 1,500 people and he took within two

215
00:08:16.97 --> 00:08:22.580
mercedes-benz s 600 limousines

216
00:08:19.64 --> 00:08:24.920
in order to carry it all 27 planes had

217
00:08:22.58 --> 00:08:26.780
to be used yes so it seems that this is

218
00:08:24.92 --> 00:08:28.820
what the royal family considers

219
00:08:26.78 --> 00:08:31.000
austerity and the prince our main

220
00:08:28.82 --> 00:08:33.620
character he's no different either

221
00:08:31.0 --> 00:08:35.720
during holidays in France and at the

222
00:08:33.62 --> 00:08:37.550
same time oil prices were following

223
00:08:35.72 --> 00:08:39.650
Prince Salman saw the yacht of the

224
00:08:37.55 --> 00:08:41.660
Russian magnate Yuri schaeffler it was

225
00:08:39.65 --> 00:08:43.370
love at first sight he sent an assistant

226
00:08:41.66 --> 00:08:46.070
right away in order to close the deal

227
00:08:43.37 --> 00:08:49.730
Salman bought it for 550 million US

228
00:08:46.07 --> 00:08:52.340
dollars so now you know how the family

229
00:08:49.73 --> 00:08:54.560
likes to live and well they are quite a

230
00:08:52.34 --> 00:08:57.590
big family so estimations indicate that

231
00:08:54.56 --> 00:08:59.210
the Saudi royal family has around 15,000

232
00:08:57.59 --> 00:09:01.070
members the government has evaded the

233
00:08:59.21 --> 00:09:03.680
question of membership numbers but even

234
00:09:01.07 --> 00:09:05.390
low-end estimates put it at about 5,000

235
00:09:03.68 --> 00:09:07.430
people and we're talking about people

236
00:09:05.39 --> 00:09:09.680
who live thanks to the public budget and

237
00:09:07.43 --> 00:09:11.270
have all kinds of privileges they are

238
00:09:09.68 --> 00:09:12.680
paid impressive salaries they have

239
00:09:11.27 --> 00:09:14.990
access to hospitals which are

240
00:09:12.68 --> 00:09:16.580
essentially five-star palaces and they

241
00:09:14.99 --> 00:09:18.500
do profitable business with the

242
00:09:16.58 --> 00:09:19.400
government they have incredibly

243
00:09:18.5 --> 00:09:21.200
luxurious

244
00:09:19.4 --> 00:09:23.630
spends honestly rather incredible

245
00:09:21.2 --> 00:09:25.790
lifestyles and the reality is that that

246
00:09:23.63 --> 00:09:27.500
is very very expensive

247
00:09:25.79 --> 00:09:29.210
according to estimations from the US

248
00:09:27.5 --> 00:09:30.800
government since transparency is not a

249
00:09:29.21 --> 00:09:33.380
tradition in the royal family as they

250
00:09:30.8 --> 00:09:35.480
spend about two billion dollars every

251
00:09:33.38 --> 00:09:39.260
year in order to keep up their sumptuous

252
00:09:35.48 --> 00:09:41.480
lifestyle but some other estimates

253
00:09:39.26 --> 00:09:43.730
indicate the royal family takes over a

254
00:09:41.48 --> 00:09:48.530
million barrels of oil a day which is

255
00:09:43.73 --> 00:09:52.170
10% of the national production the

256
00:09:48.53 --> 00:09:54.329
progress of Saudi vision 2030

257
00:09:52.17 --> 00:09:56.310
to find all of this the transition of

258
00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:58.470
Saudi Arabia planned in vision 2030

259
00:09:56.31 --> 00:10:00.959
keeps moving forward

260
00:09:58.47 --> 00:10:03.180
Saudi Arabia designs a city of

261
00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:05.670
entertainment almost as big as Las Vegas

262
00:10:03.18 --> 00:10:07.800
lots of the truth is that it is moving

263
00:10:05.67 --> 00:10:09.839
slowly and for the time being Saudi

264
00:10:07.8 --> 00:10:11.910
Arabia is regaining better relations

265
00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:13.709
with the United States in fact Donald

266
00:10:11.91 --> 00:10:16.230
Trump's first international visit as the

267
00:10:13.709 --> 00:10:17.970
US president was to react but yes in

268
00:10:16.23 --> 00:10:21.029
order to achieve that or the Saudis had

269
00:10:17.97 --> 00:10:23.730
to sign some pretty big checks Trump

270
00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:25.649
signs the single largest arms deal in US

271
00:10:23.73 --> 00:10:27.470
history with Saudi Arabia were three

272
00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:29.880
hundred and fifty billion dollars and

273
00:10:27.47 --> 00:10:31.529
this has to be added to the billion

274
00:10:29.88 --> 00:10:33.510
dollar contracts they already have with

275
00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:36.120
some of the largest companies in the

276
00:10:33.51 --> 00:10:36.540
United States and it all has a target in

277
00:10:36.12 --> 00:10:38.670
mind

278
00:10:36.54 --> 00:10:40.260
Saudi Arabia wants to reinforce the

279
00:10:38.67 --> 00:10:42.240
protection it has from the u.s. to

280
00:10:40.26 --> 00:10:43.529
defend for impossible enemies such as

281
00:10:42.24 --> 00:10:45.300
Iran where are you going to be

282
00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:47.310
discussing the special relationship in a

283
00:10:45.3 --> 00:10:49.620
future video so please do not forget to

284
00:10:47.31 --> 00:10:52.079
subscribe but leaving the u.s. aside in

285
00:10:49.62 --> 00:10:53.820
the last few months Saudi Arabia has set

286
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:56.490
the world's largest fund for

287
00:10:53.82 --> 00:10:58.500
technological investments they have 100

288
00:10:56.49 --> 00:11:00.180
billion dollars available to invest

289
00:10:58.5 --> 00:11:01.949
furthermore the country is eliminating

290
00:11:00.18 --> 00:11:03.630
many restrictions on foreign investments

291
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:05.130
and some projects are being already

292
00:11:03.63 --> 00:11:07.019
discussed some of these have already

293
00:11:05.13 --> 00:11:09.360
been put into motion such as theme park

294
00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:13.920
huge hotel resorts and even nuclear

295
00:11:09.36 --> 00:11:16.380
power plants but as we have been telling

296
00:11:13.92 --> 00:11:18.899
you transforming this country won't be

297
00:11:16.38 --> 00:11:21.209
easy at all and this is just the start

298
00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:22.740
of their very own soap opera there's a

299
00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:24.180
huge money wastage of the royal family

300
00:11:22.74 --> 00:11:25.860
which means there to deal with a lot of

301
00:11:24.18 --> 00:11:27.630
criticism from the country's powerful

302
00:11:25.86 --> 00:11:29.040
religious leaders who by the way have a

303
00:11:27.63 --> 00:11:30.839
terrible lack of respect for civil

304
00:11:29.04 --> 00:11:32.730
rights then there is the war in Yemen

305
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:34.890
and the uncertainty of the heir to the

306
00:11:32.73 --> 00:11:36.600
Saudi throne so now what do you think

307
00:11:34.89 --> 00:11:38.730
about the luxurious lifestyle of the

308
00:11:36.6 --> 00:11:41.459
Saudi royal family do you think Riyadh

309
00:11:38.73 --> 00:11:42.600
will ever become some sort of Dubai well

310
00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:44.790
