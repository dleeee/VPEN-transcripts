2
00:00:07.49 --> 00:00:11.849
doesn't it seem that lately a lot of

3
00:00:09.69 --> 00:00:14.009
movies have been shot in London one

4
00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.990
example is Bridget Jones's baby a movie

5
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.029
from the bridget jones's Sarko which i

6
00:00:15.99 --> 00:00:20.100
might have seen just look at the

7
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.670
skyscrapers in the background of that

8
00:00:20.1 --> 00:00:23.130
movie

9
00:00:20.67 --> 00:00:24.119
those were simply not there in the first

10
00:00:23.13 --> 00:00:26.310
movie of the saga

11
00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.680
in fact London skyline has changed

12
00:00:26.31 --> 00:00:30.179
dramatically in the last 10 years alone

13
00:00:28.68 --> 00:00:31.740
and this is pretty surprising because

14
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.600
we're not talking about an emerging

15
00:00:31.74 --> 00:00:36.649
economy here like China or Singapore

16
00:00:34.6 --> 00:00:39.600
[Music]

17
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.280
actually the overall economy in the UK

18
00:00:39.6 --> 00:00:44.309
has not performs that well over the last

19
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:46.950
few years however London is another

20
00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.559
world entirely today it is one of the

21
00:00:46.95 --> 00:00:52.020
four fastest growing capitols on the

22
00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.210
planet almost growing at the same level

23
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:56.830
as Dubai their population has increased

24
00:00:54.21 --> 00:01:03.460
by 50% in the last two decades

25
00:00:56.83 --> 00:01:05.530
[Music]

26
00:01:03.46 --> 00:01:07.299
this is particularly odd on a continent

27
00:01:05.53 --> 00:01:09.190
like Europe where all countries are

28
00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.340
seeing overall population decline

29
00:01:09.19 --> 00:01:14.560
instead London has three million more

30
00:01:12.34 --> 00:01:16.750
inhabitants and not only that but in the

31
00:01:14.56 --> 00:01:19.720
finance world London is now more

32
00:01:16.75 --> 00:01:20.800
importance than New York City itself so

33
00:01:19.72 --> 00:01:22.750
now you might be wondering what exactly

34
00:01:20.8 --> 00:01:25.119
has happened in London that has caused

35
00:01:22.75 --> 00:01:26.710
this massive success well that's the

36
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.140
question we're going to be answering in

37
00:01:26.71 --> 00:01:34.030
today's visual politic video immigration

38
00:01:32.14 --> 00:01:36.039
the United Kingdom has always been a

39
00:01:34.03 --> 00:01:37.960
country of immigrants and London was

40
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.500
always the main destination nonetheless

41
00:01:37.96 --> 00:01:43.690
in the last decade emigration has

42
00:01:40.5 --> 00:01:45.460
absolutely skyrocketed after Poland's

43
00:01:43.69 --> 00:01:48.490
became a member of the European Union in

44
00:01:45.46 --> 00:01:50.380
2004 a lot of poles easily moved from

45
00:01:48.49 --> 00:01:51.400
Poland to London because there was no

46
00:01:50.38 --> 00:01:54.529
visa required

47
00:01:51.4 --> 00:01:54.529
[Music]

48
00:01:55.59 --> 00:01:59.490
the same happened when Bulgaria and

49
00:01:57.63 --> 00:02:02.399
Romania became part of the European

50
00:01:59.49 --> 00:02:04.649
Union in 2007 this created a whole new

51
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.930
influx of immigrants adding to those

52
00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.789
already they're from India and Pakistan

53
00:02:06.93 --> 00:02:10.259
these European immigrants typically have

54
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.380
a higher education and university

55
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.989
degrees in fact today London has 1.7

56
00:02:13.38 --> 00:02:19.170
million highly-skilled workers while New

57
00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.849
York has 1.6 million immigrants are not

58
00:02:19.17 --> 00:02:22.800
only working the jobs that British

59
00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.180
people don't want to do anymore instead

60
00:02:22.8 --> 00:02:26.250
they are coming to the country and

61
00:02:24.18 --> 00:02:28.380
starting their own businesses or getting

62
00:02:26.25 --> 00:02:30.630
hired in the high-tech sector but Tom

63
00:02:28.38 --> 00:02:33.330
started his marketing business four

64
00:02:30.63 --> 00:02:35.459
years after arriving from Warsaw he now

65
00:02:33.33 --> 00:02:37.850
employs six people and four of them are

66
00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.850
British

67
00:02:38.14 --> 00:02:43.330
butts companies are far more than just

68
00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.310
job-creating machines or economic growth

69
00:02:43.33 --> 00:02:47.590
engines the fact that London has more

70
00:02:45.31 --> 00:02:49.810
educated people means more bars more

71
00:02:47.59 --> 00:02:51.370
exhibitions more culture in summary it

72
00:02:49.81 --> 00:02:53.800
has more of all the things that make a

73
00:02:51.37 --> 00:02:55.390
city look cool for example well where's

74
00:02:53.8 --> 00:02:56.560
the best-known Peruvian restaurant

75
00:02:55.39 --> 00:02:57.850
outside of Peru

76
00:02:56.56 --> 00:02:59.470
well according to all of the

77
00:02:57.85 --> 00:03:01.300
gastronomical guides it's a restaurant

78
00:02:59.47 --> 00:03:02.600
called ceviche which of course is

79
00:03:01.3 --> 00:03:08.240
located in London

80
00:03:02.6 --> 00:03:10.820
[Music]

81
00:03:08.24 --> 00:03:13.040
and this is how London has created a

82
00:03:10.82 --> 00:03:15.920
virtuous circle that has attracted more

83
00:03:13.04 --> 00:03:17.840
and more people this is why in 2008

84
00:03:15.92 --> 00:03:20.120
after the financial crisis hit many

85
00:03:17.84 --> 00:03:22.010
Spaniards Portuguese and Italians who

86
00:03:20.12 --> 00:03:24.620
wanted to leave their countries saw

87
00:03:22.01 --> 00:03:26.210
London as the main destination it was

88
00:03:24.62 --> 00:03:28.400
more than just a good place to find a

89
00:03:26.21 --> 00:03:30.350
job it was a cool place to live this is

90
00:03:28.4 --> 00:03:33.050
something that economists call the

91
00:03:30.35 --> 00:03:34.940
network effect the more people and

92
00:03:33.05 --> 00:03:36.980
companies that you have the easier it is

93
00:03:34.94 --> 00:03:41.690
to attract highly skilled immigrants

94
00:03:36.98 --> 00:03:44.960
today a new generation of coders bankers

95
00:03:41.69 --> 00:03:47.240
and financial tech wizards are remaking

96
00:03:44.96 --> 00:03:51.380
this extraordinary place interestingly

97
00:03:47.24 --> 00:03:54.890
since 2010 over 1,000 startups have been

98
00:03:51.38 --> 00:03:56.000
created in London every single year but

99
00:03:54.89 --> 00:04:01.820
hold on a moment

100
00:03:56.0 --> 00:04:03.770
because there's more the city of London

101
00:04:01.82 --> 00:04:06.560
all the skyscrapers that you see here

102
00:04:03.77 --> 00:04:08.420
are concentrated in a single area this

103
00:04:06.56 --> 00:04:11.030
is an area not bigger than a square mile

104
00:04:08.42 --> 00:04:13.580
and it is known as the City of London or

105
00:04:11.03 --> 00:04:15.890
just of the city yes on the one hand we

106
00:04:13.58 --> 00:04:19.690
do have London and then also on the

107
00:04:15.89 --> 00:04:19.690
other hand we have the city of London

108
00:04:23.71 --> 00:04:28.330
the City of London essentially works

109
00:04:25.87 --> 00:04:30.280
like its own country within the United

110
00:04:28.33 --> 00:04:32.500
Kingdom yes now we normally say that

111
00:04:30.28 --> 00:04:34.900
Britain is made up of four nations

112
00:04:32.5 --> 00:04:37.750
England Wales Scotland in Northern

113
00:04:34.9 --> 00:04:39.729
Ireland but really this is not exactly

114
00:04:37.75 --> 00:04:41.590
true in fact we should really add a

115
00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.530
fifth one and this is the City of London

116
00:04:41.59 --> 00:04:47.050
the city has its own laws and has its

117
00:04:44.53 --> 00:04:50.020
own mayor the city is the financial

118
00:04:47.05 --> 00:04:52.590
center of Great Britain about 7,000

119
00:04:50.02 --> 00:04:55.060
people live in the city but each day

120
00:04:52.59 --> 00:04:57.509
300,000 come to work in its banks

121
00:04:55.06 --> 00:04:59.650
brokerage firms and insurance companies

122
00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.430
London's mayor is the man was showing on

123
00:04:59.65 --> 00:05:02.979
the screen now

124
00:05:00.43 --> 00:05:05.770
his name is Sadiq Khan but the City of

125
00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.500
London has its own Lord Mayor and his

126
00:05:05.77 --> 00:05:10.479
name is Jeffrey Monta vans one of the

127
00:05:08.5 --> 00:05:12.250
characteristics over the city also known

128
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.889
as the square mile is that during

129
00:05:12.25 --> 00:05:16.560
elections both citizens and companies

130
00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.820
have the right to vote for example

131
00:05:16.56 --> 00:05:21.160
Unilever has its headquarters in the

132
00:05:18.82 --> 00:05:22.330
square mile therefore when elections

133
00:05:21.16 --> 00:05:25.530
come Unilever

134
00:05:22.33 --> 00:05:25.530
is allowed to vote in

135
00:05:30.15 --> 00:05:34.410
so now you might be wondering does

136
00:05:32.01 --> 00:05:37.169
Unilever get the same voting power as a

137
00:05:34.41 --> 00:05:38.850
smaller company well the answer is no is

138
00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.949
the number of votes a company gets

139
00:05:38.85 --> 00:05:44.210
depends on how many people they employ

140
00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.210
in the city

141
00:05:49.06 --> 00:05:52.270
by the way the music that is

142
00:05:50.8 --> 00:05:54.010
accompanying this video that you were

143
00:05:52.27 --> 00:05:56.200
listening to right now is by a bands

144
00:05:54.01 --> 00:05:57.910
called The Forgotten voice they're a pop

145
00:05:56.2 --> 00:05:59.530
rock band from Island who sent us their

146
00:05:57.91 --> 00:06:00.820
music to use in this video and if you

147
00:05:59.53 --> 00:06:02.230
liked it and you would like to hear more

148
00:06:00.82 --> 00:06:03.530
from them and please do check out the

149
00:06:02.23 --> 00:06:06.820
links in the description of the live

151
00:06:13.06 --> 00:06:16.819
[Music]

152
00:06:15.05 --> 00:06:19.280
all right so now you might be wondering

153
00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:22.039
whether the City of London is a fiscal

154
00:06:19.28 --> 00:06:24.979
haven and the answer is no all across

155
00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.930
the UK taxes are fairly similar but what

156
00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.940
is true is that the square-mile does

157
00:06:26.93 --> 00:06:31.550
have more business-friendly policies

158
00:06:28.94 --> 00:06:33.199
than the rest of the UK for instance

159
00:06:31.55 --> 00:06:34.940
their urban development laws are much

160
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.680
more free and open than the rest of the

161
00:06:34.94 --> 00:06:38.900
country and this is why there are more

162
00:06:36.68 --> 00:06:41.750
skyscrapers but when it comes to taxes

163
00:06:38.9 --> 00:06:43.129
they are not a haven whatsoever let's

164
00:06:41.75 --> 00:06:45.319
hold on just a minute because the city

165
00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.150
does play a really important role this

166
00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.009
is because the main task of the Lord

167
00:06:47.15 --> 00:06:51.530
Mayor is to travel all around the world

168
00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:56.210
and promote London as a great place for

169
00:06:51.53 --> 00:06:57.259
doing business the Lord Mayor of the

170
00:06:56.21 --> 00:07:00.319
City of London

171
00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:03.169
alderman Alan yarrow is to lead a

172
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:06.110
business delegation to Indonesia helping

173
00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.240
to make sure London and the UK remained

174
00:07:06.11 --> 00:07:09.919
the original partner of choice when it

175
00:07:08.24 --> 00:07:12.879
comes to financial and professional

176
00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.879
services

177
00:07:13.43 --> 00:07:17.360
so in a way you could say that London

178
00:07:15.68 --> 00:07:19.340
has its own marketing department

179
00:07:17.36 --> 00:07:22.660
showcasing all of the benefits of doing

180
00:07:19.34 --> 00:07:26.000
business there to the rest of the world

181
00:07:22.66 --> 00:07:27.830
business concentration the US economy is

182
00:07:26.0 --> 00:07:29.539
divided among different cities for

183
00:07:27.83 --> 00:07:32.090
example politics is centered in

184
00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:34.130
Washington DC finances in New York City

185
00:07:32.09 --> 00:07:36.650
Entertainment is in Los Angeles and

186
00:07:34.13 --> 00:07:38.660
technology is centered in San Francisco

187
00:07:36.65 --> 00:07:40.880
the same happens in Germany where you

188
00:07:38.66 --> 00:07:42.889
have cities like Berlin Frankfurt and

189
00:07:40.88 --> 00:07:47.150
Munich and over in Spain you have

190
00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:50.360
Barcelona and Madrid on the other hand

191
00:07:47.15 --> 00:07:52.190
Britain has London and well just London

192
00:07:50.36 --> 00:07:54.080
the other large cities are far less

193
00:07:52.19 --> 00:07:56.960
important to the country's economy in

194
00:07:54.08 --> 00:07:59.240
fact London generates every one in five

195
00:07:56.96 --> 00:08:00.860
pounds in the British economy in this

196
00:07:59.24 --> 00:08:03.229
city you will find all of the major

197
00:08:00.86 --> 00:08:05.419
government institutions the banks the

198
00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:07.500
technological centre the fashion centre

199
00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:09.970
etc

200
00:08:07.5 --> 00:08:13.010
[Music]

201
00:08:09.97 --> 00:08:16.250
while the amount of tax generated in

202
00:08:13.01 --> 00:08:19.250
London increased by 25% in real terms

203
00:08:16.25 --> 00:08:22.520
between 2005 and 2015

204
00:08:19.25 --> 00:08:26.330
Manchester's tax intake grew by only 1%

205
00:08:22.52 --> 00:08:28.490
while Birmingham Glasgow and Leeds also

206
00:08:26.33 --> 00:08:30.770
significant decreases in their tax

207
00:08:28.49 --> 00:08:33.380
intake and to all of this we should add

208
00:08:30.77 --> 00:08:35.510
another really important element and

209
00:08:33.38 --> 00:08:37.640
that's English as you probably know the

210
00:08:35.51 --> 00:08:39.800
UK has had a rather good relationship

211
00:08:37.64 --> 00:08:41.870
with the United States well at least for

212
00:08:39.8 --> 00:08:44.060
the past two centuries even though there

213
00:08:41.87 --> 00:08:46.370
is no trade agreements between the two

214
00:08:44.06 --> 00:08:48.980
countries they do have a lot of history

215
00:08:46.37 --> 00:08:55.490
in common and importantly they speak the

216
00:08:48.98 --> 00:08:57.590
same language add to this the fact that

217
00:08:55.49 --> 00:08:59.570
the United Kingdom is currently a part

218
00:08:57.59 --> 00:09:01.670
of the European Union and you can see

219
00:08:59.57 --> 00:09:03.560
why London has become the gateway for

220
00:09:01.67 --> 00:09:06.260
American companies who want to do

221
00:09:03.56 --> 00:09:09.080
business in Europe what London does it

222
00:09:06.26 --> 00:09:12.050
is the capital of the euro and that

223
00:09:09.08 --> 00:09:13.550
means that 70% of forex trading and all

224
00:09:12.05 --> 00:09:15.530
sorts of other over-the-counter

225
00:09:13.55 --> 00:09:18.710
derivatives all sorts of fancy stuff

226
00:09:15.53 --> 00:09:20.540
gets done through London although the UK

227
00:09:18.71 --> 00:09:23.110
is not in the euro so there's a very

228
00:09:20.54 --> 00:09:26.279
difficult set of negotiations coming up

229
00:09:23.11 --> 00:09:26.279
[Music]

230
00:09:28.16 --> 00:09:33.079
but now the obvious and big question is

231
00:09:30.74 --> 00:09:35.449
going to be how is brexit going to

232
00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:37.160
affect London's growth one thing is very

233
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:39.649
clear and that's that while the majority

234
00:09:37.16 --> 00:09:42.379
of the British population wanted the UK

235
00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:45.759
to leave the European Union London was

236
00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:45.759
very much remained

237
00:09:45.77 --> 00:09:49.580
so these are our thoughts here at visual

238
00:09:48.11 --> 00:09:52.010
politic and we would love to know your
