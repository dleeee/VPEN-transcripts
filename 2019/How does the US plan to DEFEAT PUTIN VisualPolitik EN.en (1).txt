1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,460
and by law FBI directors only served for

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,259
ten years I make this nomination

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,660
confident that long after I've left

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,309
office our nation's security will be in

5
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,929
good hands with public servants like Jim

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,349
Comey this is a Fox News Alert I'm Bret

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,350
Baier in Washington moments ago breaking

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,300
news that no one saw coming today we

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,150
learned that President Trump has fired

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:28,109
FBI director James Comey on May the 9th

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,240
2017 the presidents of the United States

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,669
Donald Trump said farewell to the then

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,010
FBI director James Comey at the time

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,140
Comey was conducting an investigation to

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,370
determine whether Donald Trump's

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,140
advisers had conspired with the Russian

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,600
government during the 2016 presidential

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,020
campaign shortly after the New York

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,640
Times revealed that the FBI had begun an

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,199
investigation as to whether the

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,699
President of the United States himself

22
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,829
Donald Trump was an agent for the

23
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,260
Russian service working against the u.s.

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,390
as interests and whether he posed a

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,050
threat to national security

26
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,570
[Applause]

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:10,130
[Music]

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,390
let's see in theory Russia's influence

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,039
on the world it should be getting

30
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,930
increasingly weaker after all we're

31
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,700
talking about a very corrupt country

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,380
with a whopping a hundred and forty five

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,420
million inhabitants but has a smaller

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,789
economy than the state of Texas this

35
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,399
results in a sort of chronic stagnation

36
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,439
I mean the economy it barely grows

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,179
however at this point of time it seems

38
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:31,560
there's not a single conflict or

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,939
political problem in the world that

40
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,369
doesn't somehow involve Vladimir Putin's

41
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,179
Russia

42
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,490
this is especially when it means acting

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,810
against the interests of Western powers

44
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,679
[Music]

45
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,850
don't believe me well you only need to

46
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,439
think about Russia's position regarding

47
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,289
Venezuela Cuba Syria Iran Ukraine the US

48
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,359
elections etc and let's not forget about

49
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,960
some recent events in Western Europe

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,119
former Russian spy poisoned by nerve

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,230

[Music]

53
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,700
yup thanks to their huge nuclear our

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,300
snowland

55
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,890
all of their natural resources Vladimir

56
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,960
Putin basically does whatever he wants

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,730
when it comes to foreign policy and this

58
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,100
has been bothering Western leaders for

59
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,590
years and this leads us to that key

60
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,830
question how can Vladimir's in be

61
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,510
stopped or at least how can his

62
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,460
influence in world affairs be kept in

63
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,710
check folks that's what many capitals

64
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,840
wonder but in particular that's what

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,450
Washington wonders so listen up

66
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,120
the punishment

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,890
you break it you buy it it often

68
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,930
prevents you from breaking more things

69
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,140
this was Washington's response see for

70
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,640
four years since the invasion of the

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
Crimean Peninsula Russia's relations

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,180
with the United States and their allies

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,040
has been dominated by economic and

74
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,900
political sanctions and penalties and

75
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,519
things they haven't been any different

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,769
under Trump in fact quite the opposite

77
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,209
the Trump administration has imposed

78
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,370
many additional sanctions on Russia over

79
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,130
the past two years the sanctions remain

80
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,440
in force and will remain in force until

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,810
the required change in Russian behavior

82
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,970
john bolton Donald Trump's national

83
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,519
security adviser but having said that

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,170
before we move on we need to ask

85
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,450
ourselves a question which I'm sure many

86
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,670
of you asked yourselves before are these

87
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,360
sanctions really effective well yes but

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,910
also know allow me to explain the

89
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,040
Russian economy is certainly suffering

90
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,380
as a direct result of them that's pretty

91
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,510
clear and it's not just because of what

92
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,310
the IMF says

93
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,500
Alexei Kudrin a very important Russian

94
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,880
politician the Minister of Finance

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,670
between 2000 and 2011 a character who's

96
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,560
quite close to Putin and now who's head

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,390
of chamber of accounts argues that one

98
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,400
of the main foreign policy objectives

99
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,620
for Russia is to reduce international

100
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,150
sanctions because otherwise Putin's

101
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,020
economic objectives will not be achieved

102
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,550
but of course there's a problem with

103
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,050
this arguments because for Vladimir

104
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,670
Putin whether the Russian economy

105
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,400
performs better or worse it's not really

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,130
his priority however folks two sectors

107
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,590
are essential for him and Washington is

108
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,090
well aware of this as they've already

109
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,010
tried attacking one of them let's take a

110
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:30,380
closer look the military industrial

111
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,710
Russian complex all right I'm sure all

112
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,810
come as no surprise if I say that both

113
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,400
Russian politics and economics are very

114
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,890
very closely linked to military power

115
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,250
but just how important is the Russian

116
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,290
military industry well even though it

117
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,910
isn't as important as it was during the

118
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,320
Soviet era the military industrial

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,830
complex is still gigantic for example it

120
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,310
employs almost 3 million people

121
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,710
in other words no less than 1 in 20

122
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,389
Russian jobs depend on the military

123
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,250
industry industrial jobs tend to have

124
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,050
very high productivity rates and we're

125
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,730
talking about direct jobs without

126
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,590
counseling the actual soldiers in the

127
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,180
Russian army so imagine the enormous

128
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,010
influence that the military industry has

129
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,690
on society and politics in Russia

130
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,230
overall in fact the 10 largest arms

131
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,520
manufacturing companies in Russia

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,070
invoiced nearly 40 billion dollars alone

133
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,530
every single year and that's a lot of

134
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,330
money it's a figure that only the US

135
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,280
military industry can beat but for

136
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,600
Vladimir Putin the Russian military

137
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
industry is fundamental for many more

138
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,100
reasons first because it's such a huge

139
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,140
source of foreign currency you see

140
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,540
Russia is also the second largest arms

141
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,340
exporter in the entire planet between

142
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,610
2000 and 2017 Russian arms exports

143
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,910
accounted for 25% of all arms exports in

144
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,130
the world as more than a hundred billion

145
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,820
dollars

146
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:06,030
[Music]

147
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,950
second the sale of military equipment is

148
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,870
perhaps Russia's most effective foreign

149
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,730
policy strategy thanks to its industrial

150
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,440
capability Russia can win the favor of

151
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,690
countries like Venezuela who depends on

152
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,430
Russian weapons or they can improve

153
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,960
their diplomatic relations with others

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,060
in exchange for military technology this

155
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,830
is something they've pursued with China

156
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,230
and India and finally along with jobs

157
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,850
currency and political power there's the

158
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,140
funding of the Russian army itself

159
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,180
Vladimir Putin funds the modernization

160
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,760
of the Russian army our weapon sales to

161
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,110
the rest of the world and let's not

162
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,310
forget that the image of a strong and

163
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,200
powerful Russia that Putin sells it

164
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,490
wouldn't make any sense if Russia

165
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,440
weren't able to produce so many weapons

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,380
in other words damaging the Russian

167
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,240
military industrial complex would mean a

168
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
huge economic crisis for the country as

169
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,990
they would lose their budget to

170
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,730
modernize their army and without an

171
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,620
advanced army lose much of their

172
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,419
political influence in the world well

173
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,130
Washington knows all of this that's why

174
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,570
the latest sanction packages were

175
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,370
directly targeted towards the military

176
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,560
complex and it caused many problems

177
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,290
[Music]

178
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,210
for example both the United States and

179
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,770
the European Union have restricted the

180
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,450
sale of a lot of technologically

181
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,520
advanced equipment and components and

182
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,780
we're not only talking about military

183
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,670
components here but also other items

184
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,380
that can be used for both civilian and

185
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,880
military purposes and don't think we're

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
talking about a slap on the wrist ear

187
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,360
the European Union alone sells products

188
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,810
to Russia

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,540
totaling 20 billion u.s. dollars every

190
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,670
year in response Russian companies have

191
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,470
turned their gaze towards China of

192
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,360
course the offers not the same and

193
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,190
that's what's affecting the Russian

194
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,500
armaments effectiveness and therefore

195
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,450
the buyers interest but that's not all

196
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,980
the approved sanctions mean that the

197
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,720
United States could end up punishing

198
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,340
political leaders and businessmen who

199
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,170
buy Russian weapons which makes no

200
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,000
difference for a venezuelan but for

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
people from other countries it could be

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,020
a strong deterrence

203
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,060
[Music]

204
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,510
the u.s. imposed sanctions on a Chinese

205
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,820
government agency responsible for

206
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,980
purchasing foreign arms the weapons in

207
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,390
question were supplied by Russia here's

208
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,730
one example of what the US has done with

209
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,650
some experts in Washington saying it now

210
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,750
goes much further how well do here the

211
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,910
key lies in the customers of the Russian

212
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,650
military industry you see in the last

213
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,240
few years Russia's biggest customers

214
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,220
were India China in Vietnam exports to

215
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,080
India and Vietnam alone account for 45%

216
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,720
of all Russian military exports over the

217
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,180
last four years that helps to make sense

218
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,800
of news stories like these Obama lifts

219
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,930
US embargo on lethal arms sales to

220
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,900
Vietnam the u.s. looks to increase

221
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,390
weapons exports to Vietnam decrease

222
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,830
Russian influence u.s. recognizes India

223
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,270
as major defense partner Lockheed Martin

224
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,940
teams up with Tata to make f-16 fighters

225
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,860
in India

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:10,660
[Music]

227
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,310
and there are more the Arab countries

228
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,870
with the exception of Egypt's have

229
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,400
reduced their purchases of Russian

230
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,990
equipment and the new sanctions on Iran

231
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,430
give this country little margin while

232
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,080
other important buyers like Venezuela

233
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,240
have well just ceased to be players then

234
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,710
there's another idea that has begun to

235
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,450
emerge in Washington for buyers with

236
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,980
smaller budgets the Ukrainian military

237
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,050
industry could be a strong rival for

238
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,550
Russian companies especially if they

239
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,140
were to receive the support of the NATO

240
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,790
countries and bear with me a moment

241
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,750
because this really isn't that crazy

242
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,430
you see 15% of all Soviet military

243
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,980
production took place in Ukraine making

244
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,720
this country the 11th largest arms

245
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,550
exporter today and even until as

246
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,710
recently as 2013 it remained a very

247
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,960
important supplier to Russia itself in

248
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,190
other words many experts in Washington

249
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,200
already argue the facilitating the sale

250
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,940
of weapons from Ukraine to rush an

251
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,040
equipment buyers and therefore boosting

252
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,780
the Ukrainian military industry could be

253
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,020
a deadly blow for Vladimir Putin the

254
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,390
u.s. approves possible Patriot missile

255
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,060
sale to Turkey in bid to block Russian

256
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,250
purchase weapons aside let's talk about

257
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,840
oil

258
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,670
[Music]

259
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,750
the blood of Mother Russia the Russian

260
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,459
economy depends a lot on its oil in its

261
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,470
natural gas and as we've seen here on

262
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,630
visual politic Russia is an essential

263
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,310
supplier to the European Union and that

264
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,579
isn't gonna change any time soon it's

265
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,100
very sad when Germany makes a massive

266
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,079
oil & gas deal with Russia where you're

267
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,639
supposed to be guarding against Russia

268
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,740
and Germany goes out and pays billions

269
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,839
and billions of dollars a year to Russia

270
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,889
Donald J Trump in the short and medium

271
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,690
term just two slight dip in the price of

272
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,730
all per barrel to less than sixty US

273
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,680
dollars and fewer gas purchases by

274
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,570
European Union countries could make it

275
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,910
very difficult for Russia to finance its

276
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,480
military modernization plans now

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
obviously the first question is how can

278
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,199
the oil price be kept below 60 US

279
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,269
dollars well basically that's by pushing

280
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,970
new sources of oil and gas yep I'm

281
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,529
talking about fracking and that's what

282
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:13,940
the United States is doing obviously

283
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,860
that conflict with Russia it's not the

284
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,560
only reason but it is happening

285
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,980
[Music]

286
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,300
the other side of the coin as we've

287
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,160
mentioned is making the European Union

288
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,470
buy less gas from Russia how well

289
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,970
essentially by encouraging the use of

290
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,830
liquefied natural gas which would allow

291
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,570
countries like Australia or the United

292
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,790
States to sell their gas all over the

293
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,680
world it may be more expensive to the

294
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,600
European consumer but reduced sales

295
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,420
would certainly hurt Moscow the European

296
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,120
Union is ready to facilitate more import

297
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,280
of liquefied natural gas from the US

298
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,860
this is already the case as we speak

299
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,290
vodka younger president of the European

300
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:55,950
Commission

301
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,270
why do you we aren't saying that Europe

302
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,580
will suddenly stop buying Russian gas we

303
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,050
already said that that's simply not

304
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,800
gonna happen

305
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,540
the idea that Washington is considering

306
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,820
is to make cuts along Russia's entire

307
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,680
value chain particularly in the energy

308
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,080
and military fields resulting in a huge

309
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,970
impact on the Russian economy as a whole

310
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,140
anyway I'm sure this will help you

311
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,880
better understand many of the events

312
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,920
being mentioned in international news at

313
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
the moment and if there's a time to act

314
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,960
it's now

315
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,250
it's now

316
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,510
Vladimir Putin's popularity in Russia

317
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,310
has plummeted in the last two years due

318
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,110
to the bad economic situation and a lack

319
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,210
of progress his popularity has lost more

320
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,710
than 30 points and this isn't unusual

321
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,330
you see in dollars the average salary in

322
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,030
Russia was actually lower in 2018 than

323
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,550
in 2008 that is Russians today have a

324
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,930
lower buying power when it comes to

325
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,790
international products since Putin took

326
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,650
control of Crimea things haven't gone

327
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,360
well and according to a survey from

328
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,850
Levada Center 61% of Russians think that

329
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,470
Putin is fully responsible for the

330
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,240
problems that that country is currently

331
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,510
facing that's why in Washington many

332
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,920
think that this is the best time to

333
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,660
strike and everything suggests at the

334
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,040
White House and the State Department's

335
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,960
have bought into this idea will it work

336
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,700
well only time will tell but what is

337
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,350
certain is that right now Moscow is

338
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,940
looking to China to increase their

339
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,890
energy exports and that they are relying

340
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,330
on the ability of their military

341
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,490
industrial complex to maintain what we

342
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,530
would call the diplomacy of the arms

343
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,940
