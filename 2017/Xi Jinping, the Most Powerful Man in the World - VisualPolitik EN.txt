1
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.820
in recent decades it has been normal to

2
00:00:10.29 --> 00:00:13.950
consider the tenant of the White House

3
00:00:11.82 --> 00:00:18.080
the President of the United States has

4
00:00:13.95 --> 00:00:18.080
the most powerful person in the world

5
00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.079
however if you were things they might be

6
00:00:29.31 --> 00:00:33.059
changing or maybe they've actually

7
00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.530
already changed have you heard about the

8
00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.780
Chinese presidents well of course you

9
00:00:34.53 --> 00:00:38.940
have because I'm sure you're a very avid

10
00:00:36.78 --> 00:00:40.649
visual politic viewer now you see Donald

11
00:00:38.94 --> 00:00:42.390
from himself in statements collected by

12
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.940
The Washington Post describes the

13
00:00:42.39 --> 00:00:47.100
Chinese President Xi Jinping as the most

14
00:00:44.94 --> 00:00:49.140
powerful leader that China has had in

15
00:00:47.1 --> 00:00:50.430
the last century which is as good as

16
00:00:49.14 --> 00:00:56.309
saying that Xi Jinping is the most

17
00:00:50.43 --> 00:00:58.170
powerful Chinese leader of all times so

18
00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.210
much so that more and more analysts are

19
00:00:58.17 --> 00:01:02.280
wondering if he isn't in fact the most

20
00:01:00.21 --> 00:01:04.769
powerful political leader in the world

21
00:01:02.28 --> 00:01:07.229
yes it's true now while China's economy

22
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.090
and its army are still on a second level

23
00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.039
compared to the United States Trump

24
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:13.020
seems to consistently be losing his

25
00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.729
influence over the world and indeed his

26
00:01:13.02 --> 00:01:16.619
own country and when you go over to

27
00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.080
China you can see that the situation is

28
00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.580
pretty much the opposite but wait wait

29
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:22.110
wait wait wait trump is losing his

30
00:01:20.58 --> 00:01:24.030
influence in the US I mean how could

31
00:01:22.11 --> 00:01:25.800
this possibly be the case he wants to be

32
00:01:24.03 --> 00:01:31.649
everyone's friends I mean he seen his

33
00:01:25.8 --> 00:01:34.470
rather sweet tweets lately why would Kim

34
00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.720
jong-un insult me by calling me old when

35
00:01:34.47 --> 00:01:38.970
I would never call him short and fat oh

36
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:41.280
well I try so hard to be his friend and

37
00:01:38.97 --> 00:01:43.200
maybe someday that will happen yes it's

38
00:01:41.28 --> 00:01:44.940
definitely no surprise that the United

39
00:01:43.2 --> 00:01:46.709
States is losing his influence over the

40
00:01:44.94 --> 00:01:49.500
world in just a few months Trump has

41
00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.450
gone from nuclear war to schoolyard

42
00:01:49.5 --> 00:01:52.890
fights alright anyway back to the

43
00:01:51.45 --> 00:01:54.840
serious stuff the fact is that although

44
00:01:52.89 --> 00:01:56.849
Xi Jinping isn't the president of the

45
00:01:54.84 --> 00:01:59.009
world's leading power he does control

46
00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.810
China's leadership tightly a country

47
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.940
which is one of the most important

48
00:02:00.81 --> 00:02:04.940
economic engines on a planet

49
00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.220
and of course sport Beijing Trump has

50
00:02:10.67 --> 00:02:15.220
been something like the lottery jackpot

51
00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.640
perfectionism nationalism and Donald

52
00:02:17.78 --> 00:02:21.349
Trump's mistakes have allowed Xi Jinping

53
00:02:19.64 --> 00:02:23.870
the president of the world's largest

54
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.239
dictatorship to present his candidacy as

55
00:02:23.87 --> 00:02:28.819
a sort of global political leader in

56
00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.829
January 2017 at the Davos forum Xi

57
00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.659
Jinping promised that China would become

58
00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.420
nothing less than the champion of

59
00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.980
globalization of free trade and even the

60
00:02:35.42 --> 00:02:39.230
fight against climate change

61
00:02:36.98 --> 00:02:41.030
thus Beijing aspires but its grasp on

62
00:02:39.23 --> 00:02:43.659
the terrain that has been lost by

63
00:02:41.03 --> 00:02:43.659
Washington

64
00:02:43.87 --> 00:02:48.950
he only forgot to mention well you know

65
00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.379
freedom and all those other sorts of

66
00:02:48.95 --> 00:02:54.099
apparently unimportant things chuji

67
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.760
change your hearts hanjung Benjamin

68
00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:02.030
surely Alibaba the schandle Shinzo

69
00:02:58.76 --> 00:03:05.030
you'll be push iron condor handle a

70
00:03:02.03 --> 00:03:06.680
diffuser but now what happens in the

71
00:03:05.03 --> 00:03:09.500
last Chinese Communist Party Congress

72
00:03:06.68 --> 00:03:11.150
how much power does Xi Jingping have and

73
00:03:09.5 --> 00:03:13.940
what does he want well we're going to

74
00:03:11.15 --> 00:03:17.290
discuss all of this but first let's take

75
00:03:13.94 --> 00:03:17.290
a look at China today

76
00:03:22.15 --> 00:03:28.210
the new China

77
00:03:25.95 --> 00:03:29.530
do you think the China is still a

78
00:03:28.21 --> 00:03:31.900
country where people live in deplorable

79
00:03:29.53 --> 00:03:34.030
conditions breaking their backs for

80
00:03:31.9 --> 00:03:35.560
miserable wages well I'm sorry but the

81
00:03:34.03 --> 00:03:38.050
reality is you're actually pretty wrong

82
00:03:35.56 --> 00:03:40.240
if you think that 2018 will be the 40th

83
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:42.640
anniversary of China's reform and open

84
00:03:40.24 --> 00:03:45.310
policy and this country it's changed a

85
00:03:42.64 --> 00:03:47.080
lot in that time China is no longer a

86
00:03:45.31 --> 00:03:50.400
low-income country but indeed a

87
00:03:47.08 --> 00:03:50.400
middle-income country

88
00:03:54.87 --> 00:03:58.680
in fact you're taking price differences

89
00:03:56.76 --> 00:04:01.500
into account it would have purchasing

90
00:03:58.68 --> 00:04:05.690
power of priety of about $16,000 which

91
00:04:01.5 --> 00:04:05.690
is bigger than both Colombia and Brazil

92
00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.829
well it's economy has changed and

93
00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.400
nowadays services are the most important

94
00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.400
activity

95
00:04:15.61 --> 00:04:19.720
for example in electronic commerce a

96
00:04:17.98 --> 00:04:21.880
sector in which the country is beating

97
00:04:19.72 --> 00:04:25.600
Europe and even the United States China

98
00:04:21.88 --> 00:04:28.180
represents no less than 40% of all

99
00:04:25.6 --> 00:04:29.950
global transactions the same can be said

100
00:04:28.18 --> 00:04:31.450
of mobile payments which are so popular

101
00:04:29.95 --> 00:04:34.600
in this country that its market reached

102
00:04:31.45 --> 00:04:37.300
five point five trillion dollars in 2016

103
00:04:34.6 --> 00:04:39.330
which is 50 times more than the United

104
00:04:37.3 --> 00:04:39.330
States

105
00:04:46.36 --> 00:04:51.800
all of this could be described as not

106
00:04:49.19 --> 00:04:54.230
bad I mean that growth has been so large

107
00:04:51.8 --> 00:04:56.000
but just in the last six years China's

108
00:04:54.23 --> 00:04:58.100
private consumption is grown by 2.5

109
00:04:56.0 --> 00:05:01.340
trillion dollars an amount that equals

110
00:04:58.1 --> 00:05:03.560
India's entire GDP therefore when you

111
00:05:01.34 --> 00:05:05.600
visit one of those giant Chinese cities

112
00:05:03.56 --> 00:05:07.910
it's not at all uncommon to find a city

113
00:05:05.6 --> 00:05:11.000
full of skyscrapers billionaires and

114
00:05:07.91 --> 00:05:13.370
high-speed trains hold on just a second

115
00:05:11.0 --> 00:05:15.200
because China's poverty continues and in

116
00:05:13.37 --> 00:05:16.880
general there is a really large

117
00:05:15.2 --> 00:05:18.830
difference between the country's cities

118
00:05:16.88 --> 00:05:24.410
and the country's rural areas which

119
00:05:18.83 --> 00:05:26.540
remain poor very poor in fact they're so

120
00:05:24.41 --> 00:05:28.610
poor the 43 million people almost the

121
00:05:26.54 --> 00:05:31.280
entire population of Spain by the way

122
00:05:28.61 --> 00:05:33.980
still live in extreme poverty earning

123
00:05:31.28 --> 00:05:36.650
less than one dollar a day and not only

124
00:05:33.98 --> 00:05:38.630
that almost 40% of Chinese people still

125
00:05:36.65 --> 00:05:40.610
live at fairly low economic levels

126
00:05:38.63 --> 00:05:45.650
although the situation is much better

127
00:05:40.61 --> 00:05:47.630
than a few decades ago this is all true

128
00:05:45.65 --> 00:05:49.580
but as I said before things are changing

129
00:05:47.63 --> 00:05:52.100
very quickly and we can no longer think

130
00:05:49.58 --> 00:05:54.820
of China as we did 2010 nor even just

131
00:05:52.1 --> 00:05:54.820
five years ago

132
00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.039
by the way talking about poverty here's

133
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.749
an interesting fact do you know how the

134
00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.879
Chinese government fights against

135
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.620
poverty well one of its main strategies

136
00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.240
is actually creating new businesses and

137
00:06:09.62 --> 00:06:13.009
cooperatives in the poorest of

138
00:06:11.24 --> 00:06:15.139
communities to this end the government

139
00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.479
has granted almost 400 billion dollars

140
00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.339
in small loans to help launch several

141
00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.979
companies and they not only focus on

142
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:24.050
money but also in culture the evening

143
00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:25.669
news is filled with tales of rejuvenated

144
00:06:24.05 --> 00:06:27.860
communities and villagers turned

145
00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.539
entrepreneurs heaping praise on mr. C

146
00:06:27.86 --> 00:06:32.089
and the government for providing loans

147
00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.919
and new apartments xavier c hernandez

148
00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:35.949
china correspondent for The New York

149
00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.949
Times

150
00:06:36.52 --> 00:06:41.210
yes yes I know Xi Jinping and

151
00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.879
practically every country leader talked

152
00:06:41.21 --> 00:06:45.650
a lot about Chinese style socialism the

153
00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.930
truth is that this is just a reference

154
00:06:45.65 --> 00:06:49.969
to a kind of capitalist model locked up

155
00:06:47.93 --> 00:06:52.279
within a dictatorship China isn't an

156
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.439
ideological dictatorship nor a socialist

157
00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:56.689
or communist one it's just simply a

158
00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.370
dictatorship having said that now let's

159
00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.740
talk a little bit about Xi Jinping the

160
00:06:58.37 --> 00:07:04.389
person leading this new China with

161
00:07:00.74 --> 00:07:04.389
almost total power

162
00:07:09.49 --> 00:07:16.849
see Jinping the leader born in 1953 we

163
00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:18.680
could say that Xi Jingping is a pretty

164
00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.270
interesting dude on the one hand he's

165
00:07:18.68 --> 00:07:21.979
probably the Chinese leader who's had

166
00:07:20.27 --> 00:07:22.460
the most contact with the West his

167
00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.080
daughter

168
00:07:22.46 --> 00:07:26.240
studied at Harvard his sister even lives

169
00:07:24.08 --> 00:07:29.000
in Canada and he has visited the United

170
00:07:26.24 --> 00:07:30.650
States several times in fact in 2012

171
00:07:29.0 --> 00:07:32.569
when he visited the United States as

172
00:07:30.65 --> 00:07:35.389
vice president of China he made a

173
00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:36.319
somewhat peculiar stop he went to Iowa

174
00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.240
well at this point you probably

175
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.400
wondering well why did he go to Iowa

176
00:07:38.24 --> 00:07:41.990
well the fact is that in 1985 when she

177
00:07:40.4 --> 00:07:43.969
drinking was a young party County

178
00:07:41.99 --> 00:07:46.129
secretary in China he traveled to Iowa

179
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:48.409
to investigate agriculture related

180
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.969
issues so in 2002 we went to see the

181
00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:52.159
family that had stayed with at the time

182
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:54.560
and he brought them presents pretty cool

183
00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:56.090
right in addition president Xi's Yankee

184
00:07:54.56 --> 00:07:59.560
side it doesn't end there

185
00:07:56.09 --> 00:08:02.539
he's also known to love Hollywood movies

186
00:07:59.56 --> 00:08:04.129
but there is also another sign to this

187
00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.930
since he became China's highest

188
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:07.460
authority five years ago his government

189
00:08:05.93 --> 00:08:09.590
has been characterized for having the

190
00:08:07.46 --> 00:08:11.779
most censorship and repression for a

191
00:08:09.59 --> 00:08:13.909
very long time we only need to take a

192
00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:15.919
look at the latest cyber security law

193
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:17.719
which seeks to control even more of the

194
00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.120
internet in China by restricting

195
00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:22.099
anonymity indeed this is to such an

196
00:08:20.12 --> 00:08:24.169
extent that all social network accounts

197
00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:26.389
have to be backed by an identified

198
00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:28.400
citizen further it's been decades since

199
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.750
China saw such a strong leader we could

200
00:08:28.4 --> 00:08:31.580
say that all this propaganda has worked

201
00:08:29.75 --> 00:08:34.360
greatly but that's not really surprising

202
00:08:31.58 --> 00:08:34.360
now is it

203
00:08:37.8 --> 00:08:42.190
the factors that in these five years Xi

204
00:08:40.51 --> 00:08:44.530
Jingping has made several changes in

205
00:08:42.19 --> 00:08:46.780
China starting with the army reform and

206
00:08:44.53 --> 00:08:48.400
they're very active foreign policy we

207
00:08:46.78 --> 00:08:50.920
saw it here at visual politic how Xi

208
00:08:48.4 --> 00:08:53.020
Jinping has diverted national resources

209
00:08:50.92 --> 00:08:55.000
towards foreign policy a good example is

210
00:08:53.02 --> 00:08:57.100
this new Silk Road macro project which

211
00:08:55.0 --> 00:08:58.750
aims to invest hundreds of billions of

212
00:08:57.1 --> 00:09:00.760
dollars in several countries but

213
00:08:58.75 --> 00:09:02.800
generally that greatest commitment has

214
00:09:00.76 --> 00:09:05.020
definitely been the fight against

215
00:09:02.8 --> 00:09:08.260
corruption and this is seriously

216
00:09:05.02 --> 00:09:09.910
important since cheating thing came to

217
00:09:08.26 --> 00:09:11.620
power is a one and a half million

218
00:09:09.91 --> 00:09:14.620
members of the Communist Party have been

219
00:09:11.62 --> 00:09:16.510
sanctions and nearly 300,000 have been

220
00:09:14.62 --> 00:09:18.460
prosecuted including at forty three

221
00:09:16.51 --> 00:09:20.290
members of the central committee there's

222
00:09:18.46 --> 00:09:22.450
more within the framework of this fight

223
00:09:20.29 --> 00:09:24.190
against corruption thirteen thousand

224
00:09:22.45 --> 00:09:26.020
army officers have been dismissed and

225
00:09:24.19 --> 00:09:28.210
more than 50 generals have been

226
00:09:26.02 --> 00:09:30.430
imprisoned of course as you might expect

227
00:09:28.21 --> 00:09:33.280
not everyone sees this battle as clean

228
00:09:30.43 --> 00:09:35.620
and honest it's a selective

229
00:09:33.28 --> 00:09:37.510
anti-corruption campaign its nature is

230
00:09:35.62 --> 00:09:39.310
the Selective protection of corruption

231
00:09:37.51 --> 00:09:41.050
when you purge some corrupt officials

232
00:09:39.31 --> 00:09:42.700
you are protecting the others you

233
00:09:41.05 --> 00:09:44.410
protect the corrupt system and you

234
00:09:42.7 --> 00:09:47.290
protect corrupt people who support you

235
00:09:44.41 --> 00:09:49.210
about all Chinese activists yes Xi

236
00:09:47.29 --> 00:09:52.090
Jinping has mostly relieved his

237
00:09:49.21 --> 00:09:53.470
political rivals coincidence of course

238
00:09:52.09 --> 00:09:55.120
it's very clear that she drinking has

239
00:09:53.47 --> 00:09:57.130
gained a lot of power in these five

240
00:09:55.12 --> 00:09:58.690
years this was certainly observed in the

241
00:09:57.13 --> 00:10:00.940
last Chinese Communist Party Congress

242
00:09:58.69 --> 00:10:02.680
the most important political event in

243
00:10:00.94 --> 00:10:05.220
the country which is held every five

244
00:10:02.68 --> 00:10:05.220
years

245
00:10:08.119 --> 00:10:12.230
but 19th Congress

246
00:10:12.72 --> 00:10:16.830
the 19th Chinese Communist Party

247
00:10:15.24 --> 00:10:20.010
Congress held between October the 18th

248
00:10:16.83 --> 00:10:21.810
and 24th 2017 was quite peculiar

249
00:10:20.01 --> 00:10:23.580
especially because it may have been the

250
00:10:21.81 --> 00:10:25.650
most austere Congress that the Chinese

251
00:10:23.58 --> 00:10:26.730
Communist Party is celebrated in many

252
00:10:25.65 --> 00:10:28.620
many years

253
00:10:26.73 --> 00:10:30.540
on this occasion some amenities they

254
00:10:28.62 --> 00:10:32.850
were removed about some examples well

255
00:10:30.54 --> 00:10:34.710
among other things there was no lavish

256
00:10:32.85 --> 00:10:36.750
buffet there was no hairdressing there

257
00:10:34.71 --> 00:10:38.700
were no facials and tailoring services I

258
00:10:36.75 --> 00:10:40.320
mean all of these used to be offered for

259
00:10:38.7 --> 00:10:42.300
free to participants and it had almost

260
00:10:40.32 --> 00:10:44.220
become a tradition but above all this

261
00:10:42.3 --> 00:10:46.320
was the Congress at which Xi Jinping's

262
00:10:44.22 --> 00:10:48.270
adoration reached its highest point

263
00:10:46.32 --> 00:10:50.330
something that as you can imagine in

264
00:10:48.27 --> 00:10:54.870
China means being put on an almost

265
00:10:50.33 --> 00:10:56.490
malike level five years ago I said he

266
00:10:54.87 --> 00:10:58.380
would be China's most powerful leaders

267
00:10:56.49 --> 00:11:00.210
since dumbs helping I was wrong

268
00:10:58.38 --> 00:11:03.480
he is now China's most powerful leader

269
00:11:00.21 --> 00:11:05.460
since Mao Zedong Kevin Rudd Australia's

270
00:11:03.48 --> 00:11:06.990
former Prime Minister see this Congress

271
00:11:05.46 --> 00:11:09.540
led to the decision that the so-called

272
00:11:06.99 --> 00:11:12.450
Xi Jinping thought should be included in

273
00:11:09.54 --> 00:11:14.580
the Communist Party Constitution this

274
00:11:12.45 --> 00:11:16.650
may seem a bit strange but it actually

275
00:11:14.58 --> 00:11:18.840
means that Xi Jinping is no longer just

276
00:11:16.65 --> 00:11:21.510
another leader he is in fact the leader

277
00:11:18.84 --> 00:11:24.990
the leader whose words formed a party's

278
00:11:21.51 --> 00:11:26.970
own ideology it means he is essentially

279
00:11:24.99 --> 00:11:28.320
unassailable if you challenge see you

280
00:11:26.97 --> 00:11:30.030
are challenging the party and you would

281
00:11:28.32 --> 00:11:31.860
never want to be against the party bill

282
00:11:30.03 --> 00:11:33.840
Bishop publisher of the sinus ISM

283
00:11:31.86 --> 00:11:36.300
newsletter so far only mouths and dong

284
00:11:33.84 --> 00:11:38.130
has received such an honor in life but

285
00:11:36.3 --> 00:11:39.870
that's not all currently a president's

286
00:11:38.13 --> 00:11:41.700
mandate is limited to ten years which

287
00:11:39.87 --> 00:11:44.040
means that this would be aging things

288
00:11:41.7 --> 00:11:46.170
last term but do wait a minute F because

289
00:11:44.04 --> 00:11:47.790
no successor was considered during the

290
00:11:46.17 --> 00:11:51.060
Congress which leads us to believe that

291
00:11:47.79 --> 00:11:53.690
she Jinping maybe at least aspiring to a

292
00:11:51.06 --> 00:11:53.690
third term

293
00:11:55.66 --> 00:12:00.650
Chinese universities scrambled to open

294
00:11:58.34 --> 00:12:02.840
centers to study president si Jin ping

295
00:12:00.65 --> 00:12:04.970
thought but anyway beyond the Chinese

296
00:12:02.84 --> 00:12:06.560
border this Congress helps define three

297
00:12:04.97 --> 00:12:08.000
major priorities for the Chinese

298
00:12:06.56 --> 00:12:09.590
government in upcoming years

299
00:12:08.0 --> 00:12:11.660
first there's the economy which means

300
00:12:09.59 --> 00:12:13.430
fighting poverty and opening up more to

301
00:12:11.66 --> 00:12:15.590
the world seconds there's the idea of

302
00:12:13.43 --> 00:12:17.900
launching even stronger foreign policies

303
00:12:15.59 --> 00:12:19.640
and third start worrying about the

304
00:12:17.9 --> 00:12:21.110
environment and you know even though I

305
00:12:19.64 --> 00:12:23.030
said there were three priorities there

306
00:12:21.11 --> 00:12:25.220
is kind of a fourth and it's actually a

307
00:12:23.03 --> 00:12:28.720
pretty clear one and that's consolidate

308
00:12:25.22 --> 00:12:28.720
the Communist Party's power

309
00:12:28.73 --> 00:12:34.100
and this is because we know two things

310
00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:35.930
for sure on the one hand Xi Jingping and

311
00:12:34.1 --> 00:12:37.730
the Chinese Communist Party will stay

312
00:12:35.93 --> 00:12:39.680
for a long time and on the other hand

313
00:12:37.73 --> 00:12:41.839
China will reclaim its role as a

314
00:12:39.68 --> 00:12:43.639
superpower so the reality is we're going

315
00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:45.350
to have to get used to taking beijing

316
00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:46.639
into account and now it's your turn

317
00:12:45.35 --> 00:12:48.050
we've got an important question who do

318
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.540
you think will leave power first will be

319
00:12:48.05 --> 00:12:51.949
Xi Jingping or Vladimir Putin well you

320
00:12:50.54 --> 00:12:54.110
can leave your answer in the comments
