5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,619
we're talking about a continent that has

6
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,599
begun a process of modernization but

7
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,250
there's still a lot to do develop the

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,050
true Health Network boost industry

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,669
mechanized agriculture and of course

10
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:30,349
responds to the enormous challenge of

11
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:35,839
improving education if we look at

12
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,850
results from recent decades and identify

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,050
the countries that have taken the

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,059
greatest economic leaps we can see that

15
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,620
the common denominator has been an

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,480
effort to implement high-quality

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,070
educational systems in countries such as

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,079
Japan South Korea or Singapore the

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,879
commitment to have first-rate education

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,739
systems really facilitated their

21
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,660
economic transition within a few years

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,550
all of these countries went from poor

23
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,769
rudimentary economies to becoming high

24
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:07,190
value-added economic powers that is

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,560
exactly what is now happening in China

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,929
of course China's success is due to many

27
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:13,520
factors but throughout this entire

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,429
process of economic takeoff education

29
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:18,530
played an important role and not only

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,840
for economic reasons but also social

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,490
cultural and political ones

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,010
and now it's Africa's turn

00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,940
[Music]

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,290
schools that aren't schools obviously

35
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,760
getting sub-saharan Africa to the

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,320
education level of developed countries

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,900
will be a mammoth task and it will take

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,940
decades and just as a house is

39
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,130
constructed from the foundations up all

40
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,420
kinds of public and private

41
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,760
organizations of invested millions of

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,650
dollars in reducing illiteracy and

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,090
improving schooling throughout

44
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,920
sub-saharan Africa for more than three

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,380
decades however the challenge is so

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,540
enormous that there's still a lot to do

47
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,970
[Music]

48
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,080
for example a lack of access to

49
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,000
education in Africa is one of its

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,979
biggest problems despite all the efforts

51
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,869
made more than 20% of children aged

52
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,060
between 6 and 11 still don't go to

53
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,450
school

54
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,280
and if we talk about children aged

55
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,770
between 12 and 14 a figure rises above

56
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,880
30 percent the usual reason given for

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,709
this situation is the need in the

58
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,780
poorest regions for children to work in

59
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,430
the fields from a young age and the

60
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,050
difficulty in meeting the cost of

61
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,970
education because you see even though

62
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,739
the free public education model has been

63
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,450
adopted widely throughout the African

64
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,920
continent parents still have to pay

65
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,800
expenses such as uniforms shoes books or

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,780
transportation and of course in such a

67
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,400
poor region this is often rather

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,420
complicated but if you think that the

69
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,250
lack of access or not being able to pay

70
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,140
for expenses are the only problems

71
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,000
hindering education in Africa you're

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,950
very very wrong the other great and

73
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,330
perhaps most significant challenge

74
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,459
facing educational systems in Africa has

75
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,500
to do with the very poor teaching

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,150
quality and with the wasteful and

77
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,250
uncontrolled use of public funds how

78
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,630
many of you might not be thinking well

79
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,580
Simon I mean surely you didn't expect

80
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,830
Africa to have Ivy League class colleges

81
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,350
after just a few years but well wait

82
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,970
because when we talk about poor quality

83
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,760
teachers we mean the standard is really

84
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,460
really low

85
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,260
[Music]

86
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,849
in many African countries such as Sierra

87
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,860
Leone it's common to find fake teachers

88
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,480
these are teachers who receive a salary

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,340
from the government but who neither

90
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,519
teach nor work since 2009 in Sierra

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,010
Leone alone more than 6,000 fake

92
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,540
teachers have been detected and

93
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,709
eliminated from the state payroll

94
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,659
although to be fair this doesn't only

95
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,430
happen in Africa it's a frequent problem

96
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,230
in other poor countries as well in

97
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,000
Pakistan for example there were more

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,219
than 8,000 schools that received funds

99
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,500
from the stage but didn't really exist

100
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,260
these were simply ghost schools where

101
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,909
did that money go let's just says better

102
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,799
not to ask but that's not all even when

103
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
teachers do show up well let's just say

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,280
that in Africa skipping classes often

105
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,750
has more to do with the teachers than

106
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,620
the students check this out

107
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:12,570
[Music]

108
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,340
yep in sub-saharan Africa it is common

109
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,170
for teachers just not to show up at

110
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,700
school some studies show that in

111
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,980
countries such as Kenya on Nigeria this

112
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,770
absenteeism affects 15% of the entire

113
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,720
workforce but if this already sounds

114
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
crazy well listen up in Kenya this

115
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,910
percentage rises to almost 50% if we

116
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,890
include teachers who go to school but

117
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,780
don't actually go into the classroom to

118
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,690
teach

119
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,610
and then there's the fact that it isn't

120
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,590
uncommon that many teachers who do teach

121
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,930
to have well difficulties reading or not

122
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,510
really have a mastery of even basic

123
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,610
mathematics even if their mathematics

124
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,860
teachers basically it's a full-fledged

125
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,140
disaster and no opening more schools

126
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,700
isn't enough this isn't going to solve

127
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,620
the problem more things are needed but

128
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,300
hold on a second because not all of the

129
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,900
news is bad here in addition to public

130
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,240
schools and the schools that NGOs opens

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,980
with cooperation aid there is another

132
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,230
alternative that has recently gained a

133
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,090
strong following in the region and

134
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,250
that's private low cost education

135
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,740
private and low cost education appearing

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,199
in the same sentence

137
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,190
even though in many parts of the world

138
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,110
private education is reserved for people

139
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,330
with high incomes in Africa this barrier

140
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,669
is eroding could private education help

141
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:32,650
overcome the problems of the continents

142
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,479
educational systems well I'm pretty sure

143
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,410
that's a question that you've never

144
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,810
asked yourself to delve deeper into this

145
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,310
phenomenon and to figure out what's

146
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,870
going on here in this video we're going

147
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,940
to focus on the examples of two very

148
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,810
different countries Kenya and Liberia

149
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,789
Kenya is one of the stars of Africa's

150
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:52,330
takeoff

151
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,550
since 2013 its economy has been growing

152
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,289
at an average of more than 5 percent per

153
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,180
year

154
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,320
Liberia on the other hand is still one

155
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,760
of the 10 poorest countries in the world

156
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,590
and is bogged down with a lot of social

157
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,250
problems and a lot of economic problems

158
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,260
so what's the country is poor as Liberia

159
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,720
doing with private education how and why

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,910
would a struggling country promote a

161
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:20,520
private education model

162
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,240
Liberia aware of the disaster the

163
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,130
Liberian government has noticed that it

164
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,020
has a huge problem so huge that it's

165
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,400
practically impossible for them to

166
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,320
manage it themselves after 14 years of

167
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,360
civil war and constant epidemics

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,450
education has remained a 2nd 3rd or 4th

169
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,430
level priority add to this uncontrolled

170
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,350
corruption and the failure of public

171
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,240
services is evidence of course

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,370
disastrous management goes hand in hand

173
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,750
with disastrous results

174
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,160
however the Liberian government has

175
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,020
decided to break the malls and bet on a

176
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,850
fairly novel way to ensure that the

177
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,840
poorest have better access to education

178
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,580
[Music]

179
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,350
the people responsible for this strategy

180
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,330
change are the largest company dedicated

181
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,520
to low-cost private education in Africa

182
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,290
that's the bridge international

183
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,540
academies a company founded in 2008 in

184
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,460
Kenya by 2 American friends it currently

185
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,110
has more than 600 schools that offer

186
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,670
education to a hundred and twenty

187
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,500
thousand students but of course it isn't

188
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,910
the only company dedicated to this

189
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,890
activity not at all in fact there's also

190
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,440
the rising academies another of the two

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,270
main low-cost private school companies

192
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,160
in Africa which was founded by British

193
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,020
and Canadian entrepreneurs but as we've

194
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,310
don't have time to talk about all the

195
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,960
emerging companies we're going to today

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,360
focus on bridge which is the largest of

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
them all and the first question we need

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,900
to ask ourselves is where has it funded

199
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,340
well nowadays it can continue operating

200
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,020
mostly thanks to the support of

201
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,820
institutions such as the World Bank and

202
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,110
with donations from business

203
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,910
heavyweights like Mark Zuckerberg or

204
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,930
Bill Gates

205
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,250
because in most cases these kinds of

206
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,599
educational companies they aren't

207
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,430
profitable they only appear to be viable

208
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,259
because of the donations that they

209
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,909
receive for example let's take the case

210
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,220
of bridge international in 2016 they

211
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,139
declared an income of 16 million dollars

212
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,360
but had operating losses of 12 million

213
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,069
that means that total costs were a

214
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,810
whopping 28 million dollars meaning

215
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,120
their costs were 75% greater than their

216
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,569
income but just a second don't think

217
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:23,680
we're talking about something like an

218
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,690
NGO here not at all these companies are

219
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,639
for-profit what happens is that they

220
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,740
conceive a long-term business model they

221
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,180
hope that the economic development that

222
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,010
has begun in many African regions will

223
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,149
soon allow to reap the benefits and of

224
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,769
course in the meantime they received

225
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,419
support in the forms of multiple

226
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,979
donations such as those of Bill Gates

227
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,079
that more than compensate them for their

228
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,730
business losses but they often receive

229
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,620
these donations precisely because they

230
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,480
have a feasibility plan that is because

231
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,220
they expect it to be profitable and

232
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,290
therefore an autonomous and sustainable

233
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,100
project in the medium term of course

234
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,290
spending is easy but managing to create

235
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,209
a self-sustaining project as something

236
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,010
else and it is precisely for this reason

237
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,110
and despite all these losses that the

238
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,000
company continues with its expansion

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,770
plan it's all thanks to the more than a

240
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,630
hundred and fourteen million dollars it

241
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,640
has earned in investments and donations

242
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,740
surprised while the fact is that in 2016

243
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,390
the government of Liberia the country

244
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,310
where less than 40 percent of children

245
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,260
receive primary education decided to

246
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,240
work with bridge international why well

247
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,529
because it's obvious that public

248
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:29,770
education wasn't working in the country

249
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,569
[Music]

250
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,679
teachers don't show up even though

00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,850
they're paid by the government there are

252
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,209
no books training is very weak school

253
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,489
infrastructure is not safe we have to do

254
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:42,629
something radical

257
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,520
[Music]

258
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,720
the point is that the Liberian

259
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
government signed an agreement for

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,870
bridge international to operate 93

261
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,090
public schools with more than 27,000

262
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,710
students access to these schools is

263
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,690
still free the government pays for the

264
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,580
students today's this is the largest

265
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,080
agreement signed between an African

266
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,520
government and a private education

267
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,410
company and this experiment seems to be

268
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,370
quite a success in level tests students

269
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,810
from schools managed by bridge

270
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,280
international achieve much better

271
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,990
results than students from schools

272
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,960
operated by the state to give you an

273
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,670
idea of the divide the bridge students

274
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,590
results can be a hundred percent higher

275
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,810
that is the bridge students do twice as

276
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,430
well as students from government

277
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,430
controlled schools but just a second

278
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,930
because in spite of these positive

279
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,490
results not every country is making

280
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,260
things easy for this type of Education

281
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,540
business take for example Kenya the very

282
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,250
country where bridge International was

283
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,910
born

Kenya's Miss trust let's not fool

286
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,010
ourselves private schools can pose a

287
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,990
threat to state controlled education and

288
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,880
many governments don't like that neither

289
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,180
the public school teachers that's

290
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,190
exactly what's happening in Kenya where

291
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,780
the National Teachers Union has been

292
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,640
conducting a very tough campaign against

293
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,589
the low-cost private schools model for

294
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,540
many years supposedly they are against

295
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,160
the teachers in these types of centers

296
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,170
who don't have a government license this

297
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,940
is even though the student's academic

298
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,210
results are much better bridge is

304
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,950
were breaking the law but so are

written in the country they're destined

311
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,650
for nor do they meet the local

312
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,910
government's requirements they're

313
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,800
usually written abroad in bridges case

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,390
educational performance is even

315

tell the truth and without meaning to

317
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,089
offend everyone is probably not such a

318
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,950
bad thing when you consider Kenya's

319
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,500
politicians

320
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,050
[Music]

321
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,880
of course not everything is rosy with

322
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,290
the private model then sometimes

323
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,300
unpleasant situations occur companies

324
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,740
like bridge international are still

325
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,480
for-profit companies which require

326
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,640
parents to keep up payments and that can

327
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,960
be a struggle in a place like Africa

328
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,310
however what's the alternative public

329
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,080
schools where teachers go to class when

330
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,820
they feel like it or where maths classes

331
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,410
are taught by people who hardly know how

332
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,150
to multiply in sub-saharan Africa

333
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,310
governments have proven very ineffective

334
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,050
in providing public services that's why

335
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,150
many alternatives are emerging in some

336
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,160
cases they are companies and in others

337
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,990
they are nonprofit organizations the

338
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,040
important thing is that these

339
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,870
initiatives saw revolutionising

340
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,220
education in Africa

341
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,410
could it be that investing in private

342
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,240
low-cost schools that aim to be

343
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,710
profitable is one of the best ways to

344
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,510
help develop quality education in Africa

345
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,670
could it be the investments are better

346
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,290
