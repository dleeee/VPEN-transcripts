YouTube transcripts for VisualPolitikEN, separated by year 2017, 2018, 2019

Decided not to upload folder for 2018 because it is unnecessary. 

A text analysis and sentimental analysis R.file is included. Make sure to reset the working directory.

All text files are obtained from Youtube Subtitle Downloader. Rstudio is used to process text files. 

Note that within each .R file, text files are sorted by DATE MODIFIED, not exactly the released date of each Youtube video. Therefore it goes in order by when the text file was downloaded from Youtube. This also shows that all of the downloaded text files were never directly edited by me. 

You are still allowed to directly edit each text files without causing any problems to the code if you want to, though its not necessary and it will change the ordering of the video in the final aggregated table (but really it's not a big deal).
