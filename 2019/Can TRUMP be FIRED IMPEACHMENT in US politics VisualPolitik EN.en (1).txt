5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,650
we've all heard about the impeachment

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,379
process against Donald Trump however how

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,180
many really understand what this means

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,880
what impeachment actually consists of

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,310
and the history of this process in the

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,870
United States I can already tell you

11
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,820
that this process is much more complex

12
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,220
than a mere debate about the president's

13
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:31,250
impeachment you see the American

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,260
Constitution defines impeachment is a

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,390
tool to be used only in extremely

16
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,430
exceptional cases with it the

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,110
legislative power can practically

18
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,750
reverse the people's will will express

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,610
through the election of presidents

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,870
therefore under very serious

21
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,060
circumstances an impeachment implies the

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,520
overriding of the democratically elected

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,809
regime

24
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,940
we're talking about a process designed

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,559
for cases in which the president has

26
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,570
committed serious crimes crimes that

27
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,219
must be clearly demonstrated after a

28
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,110
thorough prior investigation by the

29
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,059
House of Representatives mainly those

30
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:07,159
crimes include cases of treason bribery

31
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,230
and other serious unspecified crimes

32
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,850
[Music]

33
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,820
however even with this explanation we

34
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,409
still need more information to be able

35
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,540
to fully understand how impeachment

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,590
works that's why in this video we're not

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,450
only going to talk about the curious

38
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,700
process we're also going to take a look

39
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,800
at its history and talk about past cases

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,630
of impeachment in the United States

41
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,340
we're going to look at the circumstances

42
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,259
that caused them and their outcomes and

43
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,630
yes why not we'll also do a roundup on

44
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,369
the impeachment that our current

45
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,380
presidents of the United States Donald

46
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:57,229
Trump is facing impeachment a key

47
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,070
counter way something good about

48
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,630
American democracy is that it was

49
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,310
designed specifically to limits the

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,289
power of politicians you see the curious

51
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,030
thing about the United States is that

52
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,399
both the Constitution and the US Bill of

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,350
Rights are limiting this means that if

54
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,300
you read the US Constitution you'll soon

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,459
realize that what it truly says helps

56
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,320
prevent the states or the people who

57
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,150
control the state from exercising

58
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,310
excessive power over the rest of the

59
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,800
citizens

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,430
[Music]

61
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,810
this strongly differentiates it from

62
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,730
most of the world's constitutions which

63
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,010
focus on defining the rights and

64
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,170
obligations of the people and this is

65
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,599
fundamental it's essential for

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,819
understanding the meaning of impeachment

67
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,569
in the US

68
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,730
allow me to explain the founding fathers

69
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,980
establish the possibility of dismissing

70
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,019
the President and other senior officials

71
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,700
from the very beginning they defined the

72
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,099
process as apolitical instead of a

73
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,200
criminal trial that way the president

74
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,939
could be removed from his functions due

75
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,709
to serious crimes without any judge

76
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,900
ruling for or against him at any moment

77
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,810
in the process

78
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,910
in fact the only judge present during

79
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,800
the entire impeachment process is the

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
president of the Supreme Court who's

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,370
responsible for overseeing the operation

82
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,260
of the political trial once it passes to

83
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,209
the Senate but the sentence in this case

84
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,670
dismissal is decided solely and

85
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,060
exclusively by the Senators but you

86
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,560
might be thinking well hang on if this

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,600
is a political process then it could be

88
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,489
used against any president who the

89
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,500
opposition simply doesn't like right

90
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,050
well the truth is no in practice that

91
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,970
isn't possible in the North American

92
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,480
system to prevent the process being

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,820
abused series of complicated steps were

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,739
established to not only guarantee the

95
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,540
completion of a justified impeachment

96
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,790
process but also to limit the number of

97
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,959
cases beginning so much so that's to

98
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,640
this date in the almost two hundred and

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,709
fifty years of United States history

100
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,900
not a single effective impeachment has

101
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,780
yet occurred not even once moreover in

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,970
that entire time only two processes have

103
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,340
been started while three if you take the

104
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,959
current one against Donald Trump into

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,060
accounts three in the entire history of

106
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,050
the country

107
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,700
[Music]

108
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,920
now how exactly does this process work

109
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,260
and what are the steps that lead to

110
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,900
dismissal well first there needs to be a

111
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,820
reason evidence that the president was

112
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,560
involved in one of the crimes mentioned

113
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
in the Constitution with this any member

114
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,890
of the House of Representatives can

115
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,170
propose an impeachment or political

116
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,570
trial under oath in Trump's case it was

117
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,830
the president of the House of

118
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,760
Representatives Nancy Pelosi then the

119
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,990
committee's responsible for

120
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,730
investigating the case and determining

121
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,110
the facts attributable to the

122
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,330
impeachment are designated finally these

123
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,430
committees write one or several articles

124
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,530
that voted for individually or jointly

125
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,510
by the House of Representatives this

126
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,670
step is equivalent to presenting charges

127
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,880
against the president's to understand

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,710
this better the House of Representatives

129
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,420
mission in this case is to present

130
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,910
charges does the impeachment or

131
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,890
political judgment truly begins and the

132
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,900
entire process is transferred to the

133
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,210
Senate which plays the main role in this

134
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,520
entire story

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,889
[Music]

136
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,159
so in fact it's actually there in the

137
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,689
Senate at the political trial takes

138
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,000
place in this way the Senate acts as a

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,650
court but instead of judges prosecutors

140
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,840
and jurors the members of the House of

141
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,300
Representatives act as prosecutors and

142
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,100
the senators as jurors

143
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,130
[Music]

144
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,140
so if the Senators vote in favor of

145
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,670
dismissal with a two-thirds majority

146
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,550
this is equivalent to a jury convicting

147
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,560
the accused in a normal trial a

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,240
successful impeachment means nothing

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,070
other than the automatic removal of the

150
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,660
president's in the transfer of his

151
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,350
powers do the vice president

152
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,810
it seems a bit complicated but really

153
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,030
it's all rather logical think about it

154
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,410
for a moment it has to be a very

155
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,360
stringent process so that a president

156
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,190
can't be dismissed impulsively like

157
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,380
someone grabbing a bargain on Black

158
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,260
Friday but now that we know how it works

159
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,210
the next big question is what can we

160
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,250
learn from the history of political

161
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,230
trials in the United States as we told

162
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,770
you earlier

163
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,660
besides Trump there are only two more

164
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,790
cases to examine those of Andrew Johnson

165
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,950
and Bill Clinton and in the case of

166
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,720
Richard Nixon well his presidency

167
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,490
actually ended with a premature

168
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,860
resignation and despite what is commonly

169
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,750
thought the impeachment process was

170
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,700
never actually started so let's learn a

171
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,350
little bit more about what happens in

172
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,150
those cases

173
00:06:52,150 --> 00:07:00,760
[Music]

174
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,310
to impeachments one resignation and zero

175
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,460
removals history of political trials in

176
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,530
the United States is short really short

177
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,540
only two presidents have been submitted

178
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,790
to the mens neither one was dismissed

179
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,040
perhaps the least known case is that of

180
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,630
Andrew Johnson and is not surprising

181
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,680
because we're talking about a man who

182
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,710
was presidents between 1865 and 1869

183
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,169
but well what did this man do that ended

184
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,629
up with him being judged by the American

185
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,050
Senate

186
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,280
well after President Lincoln's

187
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,770
assassination in 1865 Johnson who was

188
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,569
his vice presidents became presidents

189
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,490
after he took command his policies moved

190
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,800
far far away from Lincoln's

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,860
to give you an idea Johnson was both a

193
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,870
member of the Democratic Party and also

194
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,540
a massive racist he is someone who would

195
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,720
make Trump look like a poster boy for

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,110
multiculturalism and diversity yeah

197
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,820
Andrew Johnson strongly defended the

198
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,530
slavery of African Americans and

199
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,600
dedicated himself to vetoing each and

200
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,550
every one of the bills that Congress had

201
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,740
passed suit recognized the rights of

202
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,020
freed slaves he also began pardoning

203
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,490
generals of the Confederate States of

204
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,960
America who were the ones who had

205
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,940
rebelled against the United States by

206
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,300
starting the Civil War those states the

207
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,520
states that rebels considered Lincoln a

208
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,110
threat to white supremacy whose they

209
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,150
strongly opposed his plans who abolish

210
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,650
slavery throughout the country this

211
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,630
really did not sit well with them and

212
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,340
you also have to remember that some of

213
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,610
these states had a slave population of

214
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,690
49%

215
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,680
[Music]

216
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,629
but if his actions already seemed

217
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,730
serious wait till I tell you about the

218
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,230
final straw Johnson had the brilliant

219
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,509
idea of personally firing and appointing

220
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,009
secretaries for his own government

221
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,800
bypassing Congress's validation which as

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,680
you can imagine is not legal so now you

223
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,389
can get an idea of just how complicated

224
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,369
it is dude dismissive president went

225
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,709
despite all of these incredibly serious

226
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,079
accusations Johnson was saved by just

227
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,540
one vote in the Senate this single vote

228
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,800
prevented them from reaching the

229
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,749
necessary two-thirds majority he was

230
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,939
barely saved but he was saved all the

231
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:17,790
same in fact this is by far the closest

232
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,559
a US president has ever come to being

233
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,910
dismissed

234
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,100
[Music]

235
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,990
the next attempt came with Richard Nixon

236
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,000
more than a century later after the

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,550
infamous Watergate scandal in 1972 which

238
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm sure you've all heard about to

239
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,510
refresh your memory though the Watergate

240
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,010
case was a scandal that involved the

241
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,020
President and several CIA agents who

242
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,000
were spying on the Democratic Party they

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,890
raided Democratic Party headquarters and

244
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,840
tapped calls to gain an advantage in

245
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,900
Nixon's re-election as president later

246
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,250
during the investigation it was

247
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,390
discovered that this illegal

248
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,680
eavesdropping had been controlled

249
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,750
directly by the White House this news

250
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,980
triggered calls for an impeachment

251
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:07,060
process against presidents in 1972 in

252
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,470
fact the thing got so serious that

253
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,840
literally everyone turned their backs on

254
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,580
Nixon and because he didn't want the

255
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,010
investigation to proceeds in case

256
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,050
dirtier issues came up because let's

257
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,030
face it Nixon was a rather shady

258
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,530
president after seven months of

259
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,690
deliberations he resigns the day before

260
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,340
the House of Representatives were to

261
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,830
vote on the process one day before soak

262
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,970
the truth is that the impeachment

263
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,160
mechanism was never launched in Nixon's

264
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,690
case I believe the time has come to

265
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,970
bring that investigation and the other

266
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,800
investigations of this matter to an end

267
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,310
but it was launched against Clinton Bill

268
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,770
Clinton a really messed up I'm sure many

269
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,420
of you have heard the name Monica

270
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,990
Lewinsky the end of the 1990s the affair

271
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,730
the slip the extramarital meetings

272
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,130
between the then intern Monica Lewinsky

273
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,110
and Bill Commonwealth they were common

274
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,700
knowledge in Washington and his wife

275
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,690
Hillary knew nothing about it

276
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,160
but don't be mistaken the reason why an

277
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,900
impeachment process was started against

278
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,520
Bill Clinton didn't have anything to do

279
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,140
with the president being unfaithful to

280
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,970
his wife not at all

281
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,710
the real reason or at least the reason

282
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,420
for which the process was justified

283
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,060
Clinton's lies as well as his pressuring

284
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,070
of others around him to also lie to hide

285
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,930
a sordid story that took place behind

286
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:31,000
the closed doors of the Oval Office what

287
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,430
I want the American people to know what

288
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,090
I want the Congress to know is that I am

289
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,420
profoundly sorry for all I have done

290
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,340
wrong in words and deeds and believe me

291
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,900
when I tell you that in the United

292
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,760
States at least until Trump arrived

293
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,320
catching a president in a lie and

294
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,450
forcing those around him to lie as well

295
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,410
wasn't well viewed not at all so now

296
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,360
that we've looked at past impeachments

297
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,220
and how they work what about Trump the

298
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,320
truth is things don't look very good

299
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,940
because everything indicates that he's

300
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,600
done something very serious so what

301
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
exactly are the accusations against

302
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,010
Trump and can this process affect him in

303
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:27,950
2020

304
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,050
Trump Biden and Ukraine a juicy plot

305
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,209
Trump's case started a long way back and

306
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,490
far away as well more specifically in

307
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,589
Ukraine what on earth does Trump have to

308
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,050
do with Ukraine and why is Joe Biden in

309
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:48,360
this sections title

310
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,579
while the truth is that this is none

311
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,350
other than the latest chapter in the

312
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,360
often absurdist trump presidency

313
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,189
basically everything indicates that

314
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,989
Trump asked the new Ukrainian president

315
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:00,119
valo Damir szalinski directly by phone

316
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,369
to investigate Biden and his relation

317
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:04,259
with the gas company barista in which

318
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,720
hunter Biden the son of Joe Biden who is

319
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,670
Barack Obama's former vice president's

320
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,929
in one of the future Democratic

321
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,309
candidates for the White House was a

322
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,739
board member

323
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:18,089
shortly before this call Trump rose

324
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,009
almost 400 million dollars in military

325
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,170
aid to Ukraine apparently as a pressure

326
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,059
method this could be considered a bribe

327
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,660
in exchange for a favor a quid pro quo

328
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,370
[Music]

329
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,320
it doesn't end there even the US

330
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,510
ambassador to the EU Gordon sunland's

331
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,430
acknowledged being pressured by Trump

332
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,080
who forced the Ukrainian government to

333
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,000
investigate a supposed theory that

334
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,650
Ukraine would have interfered with the

335
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,350
2016 American presidential elections and

336
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,330
no this time that wasn't a favor Trump

337
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,340
which Russia is accused of having done

338
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,550
but to favor Hillary and you can imagine

339
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,740
how Ukraine's investigations are handled

340
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,210
especially if they're done under

341
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,460
pressure from Washington in other words

342
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,900
Trump seems to be using the US

343
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,640
government's means and resources to

344
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,930
pressure governments from foreign

345
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,310
countries that have more than a

346
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,250
questionable rule of law to dig up dirt

347
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,480
against his opponents it's pretty

348
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,980
unbelievable stuff given the seriousness

349
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,260
of these claims Congress decided to open

350
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,000
an impeachment process to thoroughly

351
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,190
investigate this entire matter and

352
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,200
figure out if President Trump bribed the

353
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,720
Ukrainians to gain campaign data and it

354
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,810
doesn't end there

355
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,980
apparently Trump created a kind of

356
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,050
parallel diplomacy with Ukraine which

357
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,300
lay outside the institutional channels

358
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,460
he used his personal lawyer Rudy Jelani

359
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,680
even forcing Gordon Sunland who answered

360
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,850
him

[Music]

362
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,520
so is this enough to kick out the

363
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,380
presidents well we don't know but what

364
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,390
we do know is that information keeps

365
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,310
being uncovered further complicating

366
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,710
Trump's situation information like this

367
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,740
new documents reveal details of Pompey's

368
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,140
role in Ukraine affair emails and

369
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,400
documents released by the State

370
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,230
Department support testimony showing

371
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,750
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo enabled

372
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,550
the Ukrainian pressure campaign at the

373
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,260
center of the impeachment proceedings

374
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,210
according to testimony in the

375
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,280
impeachment query Ukrainian diplomats in

376
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,110
Washington knew there was a problem with

377
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,630
aid as early as July 25th the day mr.

378
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,430
Trump spoke with the Ukrainian president

379
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,170
by phone and asked him to investigate

380
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,760
his rivals the truth is that for the

381
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,380
time being the Republican Party doesn't

382
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,090
want to turn its back on the president

383
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,100
under the current accusations especially

384
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,610
when the elections are so close all of

385
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,470
this could change however if what is

386
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,300
known in the United States as a smoking

387
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,850
gun is unleashed that is if information

388
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,470
that could bring down the president's

389
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,970
and that is a hundred percent proven

390
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,630
demonstrated and explosive is revealed

391
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,110
[Music]

392
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,060
but until that happens and if it happens

393
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,620
it's not what for the Republicans do

394
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,390
support Trump in order to hold on to the

395
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,280
presidency also remember that in the

396
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,170
Senate which is where the impeachment is

397
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,900
decided Republicans hold a majority as

398
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,030
it stands the Democrats only hope would

399
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,890
be to find flagrant evidence that Trump

400
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,480
really bribes the Ukrainian authorities

401
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,030
to do all that is claimed undoubtedly

402
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,220
this is quite the drama and we'll be

403
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,350
watching to see how this mess develops

404
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,390
but now it's your turn after knowing how

405
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,910
impeachment works how past cases happens

406
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,740
and why they happened do you think Trump

407
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,720
could be dismissed or will this process

408
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,880
and I as just another failed case and

409
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,290

410
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,000
