10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,650
here's a question for you who calculates

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,750
a country's GDP I mean where do they get

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,940
the data to measure how a country's

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,489
economy is doing how do they get it what

14
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,380
do we really mean when we say that

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,290
China's GDP is growing at a rate of say

16
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,840
7%

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,500
[Music]

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
I'm sure you've probably already came up

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,130
with the answer GDP is measured with

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,650
statistics and surveys but well your

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,200
Commission's these reports well of

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,400
course that's the government of each

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,250
country and well who governs China that

24
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,470
would be the Chinese Communist Party and

25
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,330
here comes the real question what if

26
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,040
they were fudging their numbers at the

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,260
end of the day we know Beijing spends a

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,420
lot of money on propaganda at the end of

29
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,980
the day they need their citizens do you

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,810
believe that they live in the best of

31
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,250
countries and that the Xi Jingping

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,590
government couldn't be doing any better

33
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,260
so why not use the propaganda machine on

34
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,690
their macro economic figures - what if

35
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,520
we've been crunching the wrong numbers

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,440
this whole time

37
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,180
[Music]

38
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,520
well now hear me out nobody can deny

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,380
China's growth you've just need to see a

40
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,300
photo of Shenzhen 20 years ago and

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,310
compare it to the city how it is now to

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,710
see what's going on but I mean there's

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,480
not only that the best proof that China

44
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,310
is actually growing like crazy is the

45
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,960
fact that many Western businesses are

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
starting to sell on the Chinese mainland

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,910
a company like Lego is not an NGO and

48
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,290
they wouldn't consider this market if it

49
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,790
didn't have more and more consumers

50
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,090
every year so yes China is growing fast

51
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,540
but the question is well how fast his

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,460
where we get into the wonderful world of

53
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,800
nuance and believe me it won't be the

54
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,570
first time that this country has lied

55
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,090
about its figures in fact it is much

56
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,440
more common than you would expect

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,630
[Music]

58
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,100
satellite images reveal which countries

59
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,470
cheat on their economic statistics as

60
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,820
you can imagine authoritarian

61
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,100
governments are much more likely to lie

62
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,840
at the end of the day these countries

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
have no legal opposition no

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
investigative media and no watchdogs to

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,340
do independent research this was our

66
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,380
initial hypothesis para visual politic

67
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,960
we thought it made sense that China was

68
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
lying so we started doing some research

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,020
shion's

70
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,330
well voila we stumbled across this

71
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,170
China exaggerated GDP by two percentage

72
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,720
points for at least nine years new study

73
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,550
says yes in the business that's what we

74
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,280
call being bang on because this study it

75
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,130
was published in the spring of 2019 just

76
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,710
a few months before we did this video so

77
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,230
we read the study carefully we compared

78
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,940
it with other similar studies and we

79
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,650
came up with the video that you're

80
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,660
watching right now so today's question

81
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,350
is is China lying about its GDP and if

82
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,050
this is the case why and of course the

83
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,910
most important question of all what is

84
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,040
the real definition of GDP while today

85
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,030
we're going to answer all of these

86
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,830
questions but before we do let's take a

87
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,910
look at the history of GDP measures GDP

88
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,340
the gross domestic product is a concept

89
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,260
created by Russian American economist

90
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,860
Simon Kuznets in 1932 after World War

91
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,480
two it was used as a base for

92
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,370
calculating money transfers for the

93
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,410
Marshall Plan this is how it became the

94
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,510
standard measure but well what does it

95
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,550
actually measure well we're gonna tell

96
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,440
you right now in fact Eric is going to

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
tell you GDP is the sum of the final

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,220
goods produced in a country or region

99
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,130
during a period of time typically a year

100
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,930
this means that beyond wealth it

101
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,240
measures actual economic productivity

102
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,709
[Music]

103
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:03,140
so for example if you have oil fields

104
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,939
but you don't exploit them that doesn't

105
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,799
count towards GDP similarly if you have

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,720
a factory but it stops production for a

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,819
year the factory is not contributing to

108
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,549
GDP either but if that factory produces

109
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,009
one car then the market price for that

110
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:18,560
car we'd be considered part of the GDP

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,419
the gross domestic product for that year

112
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,340
so in other words more than money and

113
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,680
assets the GDP indicates the health of

114
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,090
an economy it doesn't care about what

115
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,039
you have but instead about what you can

116
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,440
produce and yes we're always talking

117
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,169
about final goods so for example let's

118
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,940
say that you have a restaurant and we're

119
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,220
making a salad we use a lettuce and

120
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,169
tomato and an onion each of those

121
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,570
ingredients costs $1 and we sell the

122
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,870
salad for $5 only those five dollars are

123
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,180
taken into account for GDP because the

124
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,070
salad is the final product that

125
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,870
consumers are going to buy another very

126
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,070
important thing we need to know about

127
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,960
GDP is that it only takes into account

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,720
new products this is why when you buy a

129
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,669
pre-owned house the transaction doesn't

130
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,560
count but if you build a brand new

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,690
dwelling and you sell it then the market

132
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,400
price for that will be taken into

133
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,280
account all of that said is GDP really

134
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,440
the ultimate figure for economics well

135
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,180
of course not if you want to analyze a

136
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,889
country's economic wealth you need to

137
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:18,110
consider many other figures too but so

138
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,940
far it really is one of the best tools

139
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,390
that we have

140
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,960
[Music]

141
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,300
so again we must ask where does the data

142
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,949
come from do they go to all of the

143
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,539
companies and all of the families and

144
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,669
ask them well you know what did you

145
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,620
produce now obviously that doesn't

146
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,479
happen they take samples in most

147
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,979
countries there are laws that force

148
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,990
companies to disclose their numbers to

149
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,120
the Statistics Department with those

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,550
figures they'd then do estimations then

151
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,800
other international organisations take

152
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,270
the same numbers and do their own

153
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,819
estimations as well for example the CIA

154
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,130
has a certain fact book the World Bank

155
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,720
or the International Monetary Fund has

156
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,810
something similar to that as well

157
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,640
[Music]

158
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,710
bands well you might be wondering well

159
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,780
why do people need so many ways of

160
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,550
measuring the same thing

161
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,570
well that's because throughout history

162
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,550
we've had lots of cases where different

163
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,870
governments were cheating and this

164
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,480
includes several democracies like Greece

165
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,400
and Argentina but hold on a minute

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,930
because there are many other ways to

167
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,850
make sure that GDP is accurately

168
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,070
measured we can compare the import and

169
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,350
export figures or tax collection also

170
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,030
some years ago satellite pictures

171
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,370
started to be used it turns out this can

172
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,590
be a very accurate system for measuring

173
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,690
a country's growth and one thing is

174
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,120
absolutely certain pictures like these

175
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,860
ones are extremely revealing

176
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,860
but okay this is all theory now let's

177
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,200
get into the facts what exactly is going

178
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,020
on in China are they lying or are their

179
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,420
figures accurate well let's take a look

180
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,850
the ideal political system imagine a

181
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,560
country where only the best educated

182
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,450
citizens can get into politics a

183
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,610
political system with no voting and

184
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,380
democracy but where instead of rewarding

185
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,840
empty promises made by politicians they

186
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,360
reward talent and results I'm sure many

187
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,740
of you wouldn't mind living in a place

188
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,380
like this right well that country's got

189
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,090
a name and that name would be the

190
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,800
Democratic People's Republic of China

191
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,290
this is the so called cadre system in

192
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,940
China politics is just another

193
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,740
professional career since they have no

194
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,870
elections the only way you can start is

195
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,210
from the very bottom then you can simply

196
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,460
work your way up the ladder in this

197
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,380
regard the system is very similar to

198
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,300
working for the big four you start as an

199
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,040
analyst and you climb up until you

200
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,260
become a partner in facts this political

201
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,420
system was created by Deng Xiaoping's

202
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,730
the architect of modern day China yes

203
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,870
here in the West we know him as the man

204
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,820
who opens up China's economy but there

205
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,530
he is also regarded as the man who

206
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,630
brought meritocracy to China prior to

207
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,100
him during the times of Mao Zedong

208
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,990
Chinese politicians were promoted based

209
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,820
on their compliments to the leader and

210
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,610
their praise of communism as a religion

211
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,009
nevertheless things changed in the 1980s

212
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,110
politicians started being judged based

213
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,460
on their ability to meet goals

214
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,939
furthermore in 1978 only 26% of Chinese

215
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:13,650
leaders had studied at University in

216
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,199
1990 that figure jumped to more than 90

217
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,240
percent but without a doubt the turning

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,789
point in this story is 1998 that was

219
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,620
when the Chinese Communist Party changed

220
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,569
the law that regulated the evaluation

221
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,879
system after that China would never be

222
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
the same again since then leaders have

223
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,479
been judged based on comparative

224
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,849
performance indicators for example if

225
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:34,500
the governor of a province goes to the

226
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,209
central committee with much worse

227
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,310
results than his neighbors he's going to

228
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,549
have problems

229
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,750
[Music]

230
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,000
now the goals are somewhat realistic but

231
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,680
the punishment is real if you don't meet

232
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,079
them in 2005 the mayor of the town where

233
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,139
the singing mine is was demoted why well

234
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,939
he didn't do everything he could to

235
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:56,040
avoid an accident so said the committee

236
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
what's more as there are many

237
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,100
anti-corruption investigations

238
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,779
if these investigations catch one of the

239
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,000
leaders doing something fishy sometimes

240
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,800
those leaders pay with their own lives

241
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,839
so I know other than the whole execution

242
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,060
thing Chinese communism doesn't sound so

243
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,399
bad right well this hold on a minute

244
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,589
because as we always say here on visual

245
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:18,090
politic the devil is in the details

246
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,060
[Music]

247
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,129
shooting at solitaire I'm going to ask

248
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,350
you again who compiles the numbers in

249
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,089
order to calculate China's GDP

250
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,459
you know I'm thinking well Beijing right

251
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,160
well actually no in such a huge country

252
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,410
statistics have to be done by local

253
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,939
governments that of course the local

254
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,290
leaders they cannot present worse

255
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,730
figures than what the Chinese committee

256
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,000
expects from them so what do they do I'm

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
sure you already guessed it they just

258
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,230
tell them what they want to hear this is

259
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,480
such a well-known fact that even Beijing

260
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,770
is aware of it

261
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,150
now you might be wondering well hang on

262
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,430
Simon but how do you know what Beijing

263
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,220
knows or doesn't know well because if we

264
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,839
add up all the local GDP s we get a

265
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,460
different number than the official one

266
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,170
that's provided by China's government

267
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,010
that's right

268
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,630
year after year Beijing has been

269
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,880
collecting their local estimations in

270
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,860
other words in China leaders pretend to

271
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,150
tell the truth and the Central Committee

272
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,250
pretends they believe it everyone lies

273
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,170
and everyone pretends to be happy just

274
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,260
look at this chart we can see a bit of a

275
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,290
pattern here up until 2006 local GDP was

276
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,120
lower than the official one after that

277
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,310
year it is the other way round this

278
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,350
could be an unintended consequence of

279
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,660
this meritocracy policy that was coming

280
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,000
into effect at that time now the local

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
leaders they're expected to do as well

282
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,020
as possible to get promoted and so they

283
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:47,020
inflate their figures but there is still

284
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,600
one more question how does Beijing know

285
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,370
the degree to which they have to adjust

286
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,770
those figures and the truth is we don't

287
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,720
have any idea what we do know is how the

288
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,339
guys from the American think tank the

289
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,290
Brookings Institute did it for example

290
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,790
one of the ways they did it was by

291
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,320
comparing those official numbers with

292
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,390
tax collection it is hot add sheet on

293
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,010
tax collection because this is not an

294
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,050
estimation but actual money that's

295
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,670
coming into the government's pocket and

296
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,380
we can always track that so where each

297
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
of the money streams comes from

298
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,920
businesses from the eighty this is from

299
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,410
the special tax on a particular industry

300
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,779
and so on after that we can see if both

301
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,459
numbers match if China says their

302
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:23,830
industrial output has grown by 10% then

303
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,810
the tax collection for industries should

304
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,150
grow accordingly and of course the tax

305
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,070
figures don't show that on this chart

306
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,290
you can see by industry the deviation

307
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,420
between tax collections and official

308
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,950
data

309
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,410
[Music]

310
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,000
if you look closely you will realize

311
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,830
that the deviation between both numbers

312
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,630
is completely random so it is easy to

313
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,550
believe that China might be playing with

314
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,110
their own numbers out of sheer

315
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,110
convenience and now let's hear the final

316
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,660
conclusion of this study this is going

317
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,360
to blow your mind

318
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,460
[Music]

319
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,890
our best estimate is that the true

320
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,870
growth rate of GDP is probably

321
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,910
overstated by almost two percentage

322
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,200
points from 2008 to 2016 2% year after

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,029
yep if this was proved mean that China's

324
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,550
GDP is 10% lower than what we've been

325
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,529
led to believe again this does not mean

326
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,450
that China hasn't grown during this time

327
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,520
at all but chances are this growth is

328
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,350
slower and we always thought and this

329
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,550
opens up the door to many other

330
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,380
investigations if they've been lying

331
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,940
about these figures what about the

332
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,560
others in fact this is not the first

333
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,180
time that we found something dodgy in

334
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,670
this country's finances in 2008 many

335
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,470
Chinese companies committed fraud when

336
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,940
they wanted to enter the American stock

337
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,130
market we're talking about non-existent

338
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,959
factories fake accounting books an

339
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,760
inflated numbers it took a team of

340
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,680
researchers working like something out

341
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,140
of a spy movie to unmask those scams in

342
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,520
fact you can find out more about their

343
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,899
work and the documentary called the

344
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,490
China hustle not a sponsor or anything

345
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,990
just a recommendation if you're

346
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,610
interested I will leave a link in the

347
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,560
description below so well now any of you

348
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,450
the question do you think China really

349
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,130
has been cheating on their accounting

350
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,140
because they have other frauds that we

351
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,430
don't yet know about and what

352
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,410
consequences will all of this have on

353
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,000
the world's economy well please leave

354
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,980
your answer in the comment section below

355
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,720
just before we end today though this

356
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,570
video was made possible by nord VPN if

357
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,640
you're buying things online and using a

358
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,410
public Wi-Fi spot that coffee shops

359
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,600
airports etc you really must be using a

360
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,880
VPN and that's where Nod VPN comes in I

361
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
know it's tempting not to bother and

362
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
just sort of hope for the best but

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,740
really these stories you read online

364
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,630
about people having their data stolen it

365
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,279
does happen and you don't want to make

366
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,810
it easy for people to do that whenever

367
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,670
I'm browsing public Wi-Fi I just keep

368
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,680
noord VPN on all the time so I don't

369
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,330
have to worry about anyone stealing my

370
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,160
data but it's not just about security

371
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,570
you can also use it to change the

372
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,279
country that you appear to be in so you

373
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,680
can get content that might normally only

374
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,380
be available in specific geographic

375
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,640
locations

376
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,290
nor VPN is super fast so watching a

377
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,240
video is a breeze there's no lag

378
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,520
whatsoever if you have a used VPNs and

379
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,590
thought they were slow well no more with

380
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,330
Nord VPN and you can use it on all of

381
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,130
your devices very easily Android Chrome

Windows Linux and on six different

383
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,820
devices with one account they might have

384
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,070
heard about the Nord breach in the news

385
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,810
recently but it's important to point out

386
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,540
that no user information was exposed in

387
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,460
this breach because Nord VPN doesn't

388
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,130
keep any logs on its servers because it

389
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,260
doesn't keep any logs at all it's based

390
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,420
out of Panama so it doesn't have to

391
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,670
however Nord VPN are still moving to a

392
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,400
100% owned server model unlike most

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,010
