3
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.599
guitar is the wealthiest country on the

4
00:00:09.96 --> 00:00:15.299
planet their citizens enjoy a higher GDP

5
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.250
per capita than the Swiss or indeed any

6
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
of the Nationals from any of the other

7
00:00:17.25 --> 00:00:22.320
oil-rich monarchies but today we are not

8
00:00:20.1 --> 00:00:24.150
going to talk about this it's actually

9
00:00:22.32 --> 00:00:25.769
most important fact of this country is

10
00:00:24.15 --> 00:00:27.840
not their wealth nor their absolute

11
00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.290
monarchy or their ties with radical

12
00:00:27.84 --> 00:00:36.329
terrorist groups the owners any doubt

13
00:00:34.29 --> 00:00:39.059
what made this country famous can be

14
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.340
summarized in just two words and those

15
00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.440
words are al-jazeera it is the most

16
00:00:44.34 --> 00:00:48.539
influential TV network in the Arab world

17
00:00:46.44 --> 00:00:50.700
and one of the most important news

18
00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.800
networks on the entire planet at the

19
00:00:50.7 --> 00:00:54.960
beginning of the 1990s the royal family

20
00:00:52.8 --> 00:00:57.719
that ruled guitar with an iron fist the

21
00:00:54.96 --> 00:00:59.489
Al Thani house had a dream they wanted

22
00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.559
to turn their nation into the hegemonic

23
00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.689
leader in the region but the question

24
00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.159
was how could they achieve this goal I

25
00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.290
mean we're talking about a tiny country

26
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.159
with a smaller population than the City

27
00:01:10.29 --> 00:01:12.600
of Chicago

28
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.760
of course they couldn't rival Saudi

29
00:01:12.6 --> 00:01:16.979
Arabia in the military field and Sharia

30
00:01:14.76 --> 00:01:19.110
law made it impossible to be a financial

31
00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.970
powerhouse further their geographical

32
00:01:19.11 --> 00:01:23.909
position was nothing special either

33
00:01:20.97 --> 00:01:26.580
there was only one possible strategy and

34
00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.450
that was the idea of so-called soft

35
00:01:26.58 --> 00:01:34.049
power in other words the influence

36
00:01:30.45 --> 00:01:36.509
diplomacy and well propaganda since then

37
00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.400
Qatar has invested more than any other

38
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.680
country in improving their image to

39
00:01:38.4 --> 00:01:43.619
outsiders by doing things like hosting

40
00:01:40.68 --> 00:01:46.320
the soccer World Cup in 2022 a Formula

41
00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.979
One race and even directly sponsoring

42
00:01:46.32 --> 00:01:48.979
soccer team

43
00:01:49.76 --> 00:01:55.700
but among all these projects the most

44
00:01:52.49 --> 00:01:58.310
successful and famous of them all has to

45
00:01:55.7 --> 00:02:00.320
be their TV network al-jazeera they are

46
00:01:58.31 --> 00:02:03.170
the market leader in terms of audience

47
00:02:00.32 --> 00:02:05.120
in the entire Arab world in fact their

48
00:02:03.17 --> 00:02:08.060
market share surpasses all of their

49
00:02:05.12 --> 00:02:09.740
rivals put together and this is all

50
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:13.240
despite the fact that the channel is

51
00:02:09.74 --> 00:02:13.240
banned in most countries

52
00:02:13.31 --> 00:02:24.129
[Music]

53
00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.170
al Jazeera has led to the overthrow of

54
00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.030
government in several nations they have

55
00:02:26.17 --> 00:02:29.939
amplified the effects of the Arab Spring

56
00:02:28.03 --> 00:02:32.439
and they've even become the unofficial

57
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.390
loudspeaker for some terrorist groups

58
00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.939
since the attacks of September the 11th

59
00:02:34.39 --> 00:02:38.890
aljazeera has become in many ways the

60
00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.349
only source of information for

61
00:02:38.89 --> 00:02:44.230
understanding what is going on in some

62
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.390
parts of the world even CNN buys their

63
00:02:44.23 --> 00:02:49.239
footage in other words they are a

64
00:02:46.39 --> 00:02:51.040
respected media institution well then

65
00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.620
again you might wonder well different al

66
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:55.750
Jazeera just a state propaganda channel

67
00:02:53.62 --> 00:02:58.209
I mean to what extent should we really

68
00:02:55.75 --> 00:03:01.090
trust their information and importantly

69
00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.620
what's their ideology well today we are

70
00:03:01.09 --> 00:03:05.500
going to answer all of these questions

71
00:03:02.62 --> 00:03:10.150
but before we do that let's take a look

72
00:03:05.5 --> 00:03:13.329
at some history the importance of being

73
00:03:10.15 --> 00:03:14.470
unique in 1995 the BBC closed their Arab

74
00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.019
Channel because the Saudi government

75
00:03:14.47 --> 00:03:20.349
wanted to interfere in their editorial

76
00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.569
process 150 journalists got fired all of

77
00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.819
them Arab journalists who were trained

78
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.979
at one of the most prestigious media

79
00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.409
organizations in the world these people

80
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.209
have a deep knowledge of Muslim culture

81
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.459
but at the same time they couldn't meet

82
00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.349
the high standards of Western media this

83
00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.980
is where the Emir of Qatar is at I'm

84
00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.100
Hamad al-thani comes in

85
00:03:38.98 --> 00:03:42.100
[Music]

86
00:03:42.25 --> 00:03:46.990
I'll Tommy had just come to power and

87
00:03:44.62 --> 00:03:48.970
had a clear vision for his country he

88
00:03:46.99 --> 00:03:50.980
wanted it to become the leader of the

89
00:03:48.97 --> 00:03:53.740
Islamic world in order to achieve that

90
00:03:50.98 --> 00:03:55.870
those 150 unemployed journalists were

91
00:03:53.74 --> 00:03:57.970
given an opportunity as soon as they

92
00:03:55.87 --> 00:03:59.890
lost their jobs Qatar offered them brand

93
00:03:57.97 --> 00:04:02.650
new ones now what was their mission

94
00:03:59.89 --> 00:04:04.870
well that was to create a brand new news

95
00:04:02.65 --> 00:04:06.610
network an Arab seeking media outlet

96
00:04:04.87 --> 00:04:08.560
that would meet the quality of Western

97
00:04:06.61 --> 00:04:10.510
media that's any cost

98
00:04:08.56 --> 00:04:13.030
katella's government's gave them a one

99
00:04:10.51 --> 00:04:15.670
hundred and forty seven million dollar

100
00:04:13.03 --> 00:04:17.620
loan and with that this team of 150

101
00:04:15.67 --> 00:04:20.049
journalists could buy state-of-the-art

102
00:04:17.62 --> 00:04:22.000
studios as correspondents in many

103
00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:28.510
countries and broadcast through a

104
00:04:22.0 --> 00:04:30.640
satellite every little detail was taken

105
00:04:28.51 --> 00:04:33.190
care of for example to design their logo

106
00:04:30.64 --> 00:04:34.450
the Emir made a public contest finally

107
00:04:33.19 --> 00:04:36.520
this one the one that you see on the

108
00:04:34.45 --> 00:04:39.840
screen now was the winner and as you can

109
00:04:36.52 --> 00:04:42.710
see it reads al Jazeera in Arabic

110
00:04:39.84 --> 00:04:45.800
[Music]

111
00:04:42.71 --> 00:04:47.419
finally in 1996 al-jazeera that means

112
00:04:45.8 --> 00:04:49.850
the island in arabic started

113
00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.620
broadcasting to the arab world in very

114
00:04:49.85 --> 00:04:52.759
little time at all they surpassed the

115
00:04:51.62 --> 00:04:54.169
rest of their rivals

116
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.199
think about it I mean back in the day

117
00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.000
Arab TV was extremely boring in this

118
00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.190
part of the world freedom of the

119
00:04:59.0 --> 00:05:03.410
expression doesn't really exist and

120
00:05:01.19 --> 00:05:05.720
therefore TV news just offered official

121
00:05:03.41 --> 00:05:07.789
announcements al-jazeera was different

122
00:05:05.72 --> 00:05:09.740
they had no problem with criticizing

123
00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.470
various politicians and royal families

124
00:05:09.74 --> 00:05:14.270
they showed corruption scandals and they

125
00:05:12.47 --> 00:05:16.639
even interviewed political dissidents

126
00:05:14.27 --> 00:05:18.470
all of this was done in a dynamic style

127
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.660
that had never been seen on Arabic

128
00:05:18.47 --> 00:05:26.210
television before nevertheless the real

129
00:05:23.66 --> 00:05:28.669
turning point for Al Jazeera was 9/11

130
00:05:26.21 --> 00:05:30.350
Osama bin Laden used this TV network to

131
00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.270
broadcast his claims of a terrorist

132
00:05:30.35 --> 00:05:35.510
attack all of a sudden the name al

133
00:05:32.27 --> 00:05:37.849
Jazeera was being said on TV news around

134
00:05:35.51 --> 00:05:39.440
the world but not only that a month

135
00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.880
after the terrorist attack the American

136
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:43.039
government had declared war on

137
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:45.979
Afghanistan back then all the big media

138
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.349
corporations like CNN or CNBC had

139
00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.760
correspondents in Tokyo London or Berlin

140
00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.400
but no one at source

141
00:05:49.76 --> 00:05:57.710
Kabul would be that newsworthy sans

142
00:05:55.4 --> 00:06:00.199
world death he did have an office in the

143
00:05:57.71 --> 00:06:02.210
Afghan capital yep that would be al

144
00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.860
Jazeera since they were a channel

145
00:06:02.21 --> 00:06:05.690
targeted to the Muslim world they had

146
00:06:03.86 --> 00:06:07.970
correspondents in all of the Muslim

147
00:06:05.69 --> 00:06:09.919
countries suddenly al Jazeera footage

148
00:06:07.97 --> 00:06:12.500
was appearing on televisions all around

149
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.960
the world this is why in 2004 the Emir

150
00:06:12.5 --> 00:06:16.729
of Qatar realized that what he had not

151
00:06:14.96 --> 00:06:19.310
only with the powerful tool to reach the

152
00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.979
Arab world that indeed the world at

153
00:06:19.31 --> 00:06:24.139
large and this is how English al Jazeera

154
00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.240
was born and it was ready to broadcast

155
00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.340
into the most competitive media market

156
00:06:26.24 --> 00:06:29.510
in the world the United States of

157
00:06:28.34 --> 00:06:31.630
America

158
00:06:29.51 --> 00:06:34.700
[Music]

159
00:06:31.63 --> 00:06:36.110
since then al Jazeera has become the TV

160
00:06:34.7 --> 00:06:38.750
news that talks about countries that

161
00:06:36.11 --> 00:06:40.370
never appear on American TV news want to

162
00:06:38.75 --> 00:06:42.020
know about Africa's well tune and Al

163
00:06:40.37 --> 00:06:44.510
Jazeera what about the Middle East again

164
00:06:42.02 --> 00:06:46.190
go to Al Jazeera Central Asia we are

165
00:06:44.51 --> 00:06:48.350
beginning to get the picture

166
00:06:46.19 --> 00:06:50.690
let's do wait a minute because things

167
00:06:48.35 --> 00:06:53.180
are not quite as great as they seem to

168
00:06:50.69 --> 00:06:55.580
be don't forget we are talking about a

169
00:06:53.18 --> 00:06:57.890
TV network that is being paid for by a

170
00:06:55.58 --> 00:07:00.410
government in order to instruments of a

171
00:06:57.89 --> 00:07:02.840
country starving the sounds of it like

172
00:07:00.41 --> 00:07:05.650
it might be propaganda well let's dive a

173
00:07:02.84 --> 00:07:05.650
little bit deeper

174
00:07:07.45 --> 00:07:13.250
Islam's enfant toid as we said before

175
00:07:10.73 --> 00:07:15.530
al-jazeera was the first Arab TV network

176
00:07:13.25 --> 00:07:18.470
that openly criticized the governments

177
00:07:15.53 --> 00:07:21.190
of other countries so we started the

178
00:07:18.47 --> 00:07:24.020
revolution back in 2011 rather

179
00:07:21.19 --> 00:07:26.210
unsurprisingly this was not always

180
00:07:24.02 --> 00:07:28.250
welcomed especially given that most of

181
00:07:26.21 --> 00:07:31.730
these other countries are dictatorships

182
00:07:28.25 --> 00:07:33.500
so in 2011 uprising in Tunisia started

183
00:07:31.73 --> 00:07:35.480
out and the dictator of this nation

184
00:07:33.5 --> 00:07:37.820
abandoned it all of these facts could

185
00:07:35.48 --> 00:07:38.720
have had little to no impact abroad the

186
00:07:37.82 --> 00:07:41.270
al-jazeera

187
00:07:38.72 --> 00:07:42.590
had a deep coverage of this uprising so

188
00:07:41.27 --> 00:07:45.320
that it could be seen in other countries

189
00:07:42.59 --> 00:07:47.480
since it was a satellite station their

190
00:07:45.32 --> 00:07:50.630
signal was arriving to feds all across

191
00:07:47.48 --> 00:07:53.670
North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula

192
00:07:50.63 --> 00:07:55.920
[Music]

193
00:07:53.67 --> 00:07:58.440
this is how the inhabitants of other

194
00:07:55.92 --> 00:08:00.030
countries next to Tunisia like Egypt saw

195
00:07:58.44 --> 00:08:02.160
their neighbors protesting and thought

196
00:08:00.03 --> 00:08:04.200
wait a minute we've also got a dictator

197
00:08:02.16 --> 00:08:05.940
could we do something just like that and

198
00:08:04.2 --> 00:08:08.610
of course nearly every person in

199
00:08:05.94 --> 00:08:10.830
opposition whomever had a news show that

200
00:08:08.61 --> 00:08:12.540
they could now watch and of course this

201
00:08:10.83 --> 00:08:18.540
was not something that whens over

202
00:08:12.54 --> 00:08:21.120
brilliantly wins those dictators of zero

203
00:08:18.54 --> 00:08:24.200
shut down in Egypt as Mubarak fights for

204
00:08:21.12 --> 00:08:24.200
control of airwaves

205
00:08:25.2 --> 00:08:29.190
but well what exactly is the problem

206
00:08:27.42 --> 00:08:31.320
here well censoring a satellite TV

207
00:08:29.19 --> 00:08:33.870
station is harder than it seems of

208
00:08:31.32 --> 00:08:36.000
course you can forbid it if you want but

209
00:08:33.87 --> 00:08:38.040
if someone wants to access the station

210
00:08:36.0 --> 00:08:39.930
and they have a satellite dish then

211
00:08:38.04 --> 00:08:41.880
technically it's possible if you are

212
00:08:39.93 --> 00:08:43.950
having problems receiving any al-jazeera

213
00:08:41.88 --> 00:08:45.390
channels this guide will take you

214
00:08:43.95 --> 00:08:48.210
through the process of tuning your

215
00:08:45.39 --> 00:08:50.280
satellite receiver so in a matter of

216
00:08:48.21 --> 00:08:51.810
months all of these Arab citizens were

217
00:08:50.28 --> 00:08:54.090
seeing their neighboring countries

218
00:08:51.81 --> 00:08:56.460
overthrowing their dictators and this

219
00:08:54.09 --> 00:09:02.430
explains the impasse the Arab Spring

220
00:08:56.46 --> 00:09:04.920
phenomenon but wait a minute again

221
00:09:02.43 --> 00:09:06.630
because not everything is perfect of

222
00:09:04.92 --> 00:09:08.760
course now al-jazeera helps to finish

223
00:09:06.63 --> 00:09:10.980
off a lot of dictatorships but the truth

224
00:09:08.76 --> 00:09:13.100
is the people they promoted on their

225
00:09:10.98 --> 00:09:20.070
network were not really any more

226
00:09:13.1 --> 00:09:22.200
democratic for years the Muslim

227
00:09:20.07 --> 00:09:26.090
Brotherhood spiritual leader was given

228
00:09:22.2 --> 00:09:26.090
his own television show on al-jazeera

[Music]

230
00:09:28.04 --> 00:09:33.360
even - the Islamic state was portrayed

231
00:09:31.02 --> 00:09:36.210
by Al Jazeera and adjustement opposition

232
00:09:33.36 --> 00:09:38.370
Force to al-assad in Syria and even as a

233
00:09:36.21 --> 00:09:40.080
group of moderate rebels the same

234
00:09:38.37 --> 00:09:42.930
happens with other Sunni radical

235
00:09:40.08 --> 00:09:44.700
terrorists like Al Qaeda and now you

236
00:09:42.93 --> 00:09:46.680
might be wondering is al-jazeera and

237
00:09:44.7 --> 00:09:48.840
networks that stands for radicalism and

238
00:09:46.68 --> 00:09:50.790
against the West well the truth is

239
00:09:48.84 --> 00:09:51.510
they've also been accused of just the

240
00:09:50.79 --> 00:09:53.760
opposite

241
00:09:51.51 --> 00:09:55.450
just ask the Emir and Bahrain and two

242
00:09:53.76 --> 00:09:58.310
governments

243
00:09:55.45 --> 00:10:00.110
this sort of information Nabil al hammer

244
00:09:58.31 --> 00:10:02.060
told journalists that Al Jazeera's

245
00:10:00.11 --> 00:10:03.920
correspondence had been banned from

246
00:10:02.06 --> 00:10:06.350
Bahrain Al Hamra claimed that the

247
00:10:03.92 --> 00:10:09.460
station was a medium for quote Zionist

248
00:10:06.35 --> 00:10:12.740
infiltration of the Gulf region

00:10:09.46 --> 00:10:15.260
[Music]

250
00:10:12.74 --> 00:10:17.570
surprise well for many al Jazeera is

251
00:10:15.26 --> 00:10:19.280
Zionist Western propaganda while for

252
00:10:17.57 --> 00:10:21.800
others it's the TV station of the

253
00:10:19.28 --> 00:10:23.810
radicals in fact the only common ground

254
00:10:21.8 --> 00:10:26.000
for al Jazeera when it comes to ideology

255
00:10:23.81 --> 00:10:28.340
is the interests of the ones who

256
00:10:26.0 --> 00:10:30.590
financed them the royal house of Al

257
00:10:28.34 --> 00:10:34.840
Thani who by the way don't support

258
00:10:30.59 --> 00:10:34.840
freedom of speech in their own country

259
00:10:38.26 --> 00:10:42.890
WikiLeaks cables claim al Jazeera

260
00:10:40.67 --> 00:10:44.810
changed coverage to soup Qatari foreign

261
00:10:42.89 --> 00:10:46.880
policies nevertheless this doesn't mean

262
00:10:44.81 --> 00:10:48.710
they cannot show the dark side of Qatar

263
00:10:46.88 --> 00:10:50.660
in fact despite being paid for by the

264
00:10:48.71 --> 00:10:52.280
royal house al Jazeera is more

265
00:10:50.66 --> 00:10:55.570
independent than many other state

266
00:10:52.28 --> 00:10:55.570
sponsored news networks

267
00:10:56.62 --> 00:11:01.460
for instance what you see on the screen

268
00:10:59.21 --> 00:11:03.500
here are extracts from a talk show about

269
00:11:01.46 --> 00:11:05.570
the Emir slave-like working conditions

270
00:11:03.5 --> 00:11:09.380
suffered by immigrants who work in Qatar

271
00:11:05.57 --> 00:11:11.570
as construction workers in this show

272
00:11:09.38 --> 00:11:13.520
foreign trade unionists were invited and

273
00:11:11.57 --> 00:11:15.770
had the chance to openly criticize the

274
00:11:13.52 --> 00:11:17.930
Al Thani family and their policies in

275
00:11:15.77 --> 00:11:19.790
other words Al Jazeera's directors are

276
00:11:17.93 --> 00:11:22.790
smart enough to limit their propaganda

277
00:11:19.79 --> 00:11:24.740
and not lose their audience of course

278
00:11:22.79 --> 00:11:27.230
they have an ideology and a lot of

279
00:11:24.74 --> 00:11:29.720
interest to meet but they are all aware

280
00:11:27.23 --> 00:11:31.490
that in today's world you cannot silence

281
00:11:29.72 --> 00:11:33.650
the reality of what's happening because

282
00:11:31.49 --> 00:11:34.370
if you don't tell us others are going to

283
00:11:33.65 --> 00:11:37.170

285
00:11:37.17 --> 00:11:41.560
at the end of the day al-jazeera is

286
00:11:39.76 --> 00:11:43.390
forbidden in almost all countries in the

287
00:11:41.56 --> 00:11:45.340
region including Saudi Arabia

288
00:11:43.39 --> 00:11:48.160
nonetheless they are still the most

289
00:11:45.34 --> 00:11:50.050
influential and most watched TV network

290
00:11:48.16 --> 00:11:51.760
everyone knows who pays for them but at

291
00:11:50.05 --> 00:11:54.580
the same time that they are the only

292
00:11:51.76 --> 00:11:57.040
source for many news topics in fact the

293
00:11:54.58 --> 00:11:59.020
al-jazeera model has lots of caveats in

00:11:57.04 --> 00:12:01.360
2003 the Saudis founded their own

the Iranian government in order to

that would be do you think you're to
