3
00:00:12.91 --> 00:00:17.920
a hundred years ago in 1917 the Russian

4
00:00:15.43 --> 00:00:19.480
Revolution defeated the Russian Empire

5
00:00:17.92 --> 00:00:21.580
after more than three centuries of

6
00:00:19.48 --> 00:00:23.740
Czarist rule the Romanovs were replaced

7
00:00:21.58 --> 00:00:25.900
in a violence way by the Soviet regime

8
00:00:23.74 --> 00:00:28.259
the seed that would turn into the Soviet

9
00:00:25.9 --> 00:00:28.259
Union

10
00:00:31.12 --> 00:00:35.170
but the results of this wasn't exactly

11
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:37.900
more freedom for the Russian people

12
00:00:35.17 --> 00:00:39.580
however this is not a history video we

13
00:00:37.9 --> 00:00:41.740
are not going to discuss the past but

14
00:00:39.58 --> 00:00:43.960
rather the present and that's because

15
00:00:41.74 --> 00:00:46.810
many are seeing the new situation in

16
00:00:43.96 --> 00:00:49.150
Russia as the rebirth of a new Tsarist

17
00:00:46.81 --> 00:00:51.280
regime but is it fair to really talk

18
00:00:49.15 --> 00:00:53.530
about a new Tsarist Russia isn't this

19
00:00:51.28 --> 00:00:55.420
perhaps some kind of overreaction well

20
00:00:53.53 --> 00:00:56.920
let's see by the way in this video

21
00:00:55.42 --> 00:00:59.860
you're also going to learn what is the

22
00:00:56.92 --> 00:01:01.330
fastest way to become rich filthy rich

23
00:00:59.86 --> 00:01:02.530
in fact but don't worry we haven't gone

24
00:01:01.33 --> 00:01:03.519
insane and we're not going to try and

25
00:01:02.53 --> 00:01:05.290
tell you about a great opportunity

26
00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.900
you're missing out on with pyramid

27
00:01:05.29 --> 00:01:09.900
scheme X Y Z I'll explain more in a bit

28
00:01:10.82 --> 00:01:13.950
[Music]

29
00:01:15.96 --> 00:01:25.250
a new Tsar

30
00:01:23.03 --> 00:01:28.190
around 18 years ago on the 31st of

31
00:01:25.25 --> 00:01:30.530
December 1999 a still unknown Vladimir

32
00:01:28.19 --> 00:01:32.960
Putin became the president of Russia and

33
00:01:30.53 --> 00:01:34.640
in 2018 Putin will likely win the

34
00:01:32.96 --> 00:01:36.620
elections and remain president for

35
00:01:34.64 --> 00:01:38.840
another six years so when this next

36
00:01:36.62 --> 00:01:40.970
legislative term is finished in 2024

37
00:01:38.84 --> 00:01:43.820
Putin will have already ruled Russia for

38
00:01:40.97 --> 00:01:45.229
25 years and this is a longer period of

39
00:01:43.82 --> 00:01:47.150
rule than many of the Tsar's from

40
00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.920
Russia's pre-revolution history indeed

41
00:01:47.15 --> 00:01:50.840
Putin has developed a political system

42
00:01:48.92 --> 00:01:52.760
with a close resemblance to that of the

43
00:01:50.84 --> 00:01:54.440
older Russian Empire Hooten is developed

44
00:01:52.76 --> 00:01:56.630
a similar political system but with a

45
00:01:54.44 --> 00:01:58.550
personal touch and just a dusting of

46
00:01:56.63 --> 00:02:00.979
Soviet seasoning there on the one hand

47
00:01:58.55 --> 00:02:02.770
Putin's new regime has restored two of

48
00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.140
the main features of the old USSR

49
00:02:02.77 --> 00:02:09.380
propaganda and repression opposition

50
00:02:06.14 --> 00:02:11.300
leader Alexei Navalny jailed as 1750

51
00:02:09.38 --> 00:02:12.950
arrested during protests across Russia

52
00:02:11.3 --> 00:02:14.450
that's right with Putin in charge we

53
00:02:12.95 --> 00:02:16.250
could say that the Secret Service and

54
00:02:14.45 --> 00:02:18.860
the political police which once was the

55
00:02:16.25 --> 00:02:20.720
old KGB have come back to life and they

56
00:02:18.86 --> 00:02:22.640
are now known as the Federal Security

57
00:02:20.72 --> 00:02:24.440
Service also one of the first things

58
00:02:22.64 --> 00:02:26.330
Putin did when he reached power was to

59
00:02:24.44 --> 00:02:28.519
take control over television and the

60
00:02:26.33 --> 00:02:30.950
media and set up a powerful campaign of

61
00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.900
patriotic glorification with a clear

62
00:02:30.95 --> 00:02:34.970
goal that goal being to get people to

63
00:02:32.9 --> 00:02:37.040
subscribe to the notion that hey Putin's

64
00:02:34.97 --> 00:02:38.600
here and Russia is amazing again alright

65
00:02:37.04 --> 00:02:40.610
but if we consider the use of propaganda

66
00:02:38.6 --> 00:02:43.459
Rindge repression as Soviet heritage

67
00:02:40.61 --> 00:02:47.150
mostly why are we talking about a new

68
00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.799
Tsar well that's partly because he is

69
00:02:47.15 --> 00:02:50.840
restore to the close alliance between

70
00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.760
the Orthodox Church and the state but

71
00:02:50.84 --> 00:02:54.560
mainly because Putin has consolidated a

72
00:02:52.76 --> 00:02:56.780
state controlled by a powerful ally

73
00:02:54.56 --> 00:02:58.760
agachi that is similar to the old feudal

74
00:02:56.78 --> 00:03:00.470
system for the aristocracy of the

75
00:02:58.76 --> 00:03:02.299
Russian Empire you see Putin has

76
00:03:00.47 --> 00:03:04.190
befriended a group of people to whom he

77
00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.410
has granted control of the big companies

78
00:03:04.19 --> 00:03:08.090
in the country and whom he has made very

79
00:03:06.41 --> 00:03:09.650
rich remember when I told you we were

80
00:03:08.09 --> 00:03:11.870
gonna tell you the fastest way to become

81
00:03:09.65 --> 00:03:14.299
a multi-millionaire well this is the

82
00:03:11.87 --> 00:03:17.570
formula the friend Vladimir Putin

83
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.280
believe me I'll consider this we could

84
00:03:17.57 --> 00:03:20.930
talk about sergei roldugin putin's

85
00:03:19.28 --> 00:03:22.640
childhood friend he received around two

86
00:03:20.93 --> 00:03:24.530
billion dollars in government funds or

87
00:03:22.64 --> 00:03:26.810
other close friends like Igor Sechin

88
00:03:24.53 --> 00:03:28.400
putin's old chief of staff or Alexey

89
00:03:26.81 --> 00:03:30.709
Miller an old collaborator and

90
00:03:28.4 --> 00:03:33.170
consultant or there's Sergey Chalmers of

91
00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.280
an old friend from the KGB they are all

92
00:03:33.17 --> 00:03:35.750
multimillionaires today

93
00:03:34.28 --> 00:03:37.610
and they are the CEOs of some of the

94
00:03:35.75 --> 00:03:41.120
most important state-owned companies

95
00:03:37.61 --> 00:03:42.680
Gazprom Rosneft and rostec not bad right

96
00:03:41.12 --> 00:03:45.260
and do not think for a moment these are

97
00:03:42.68 --> 00:03:47.810
isolated situations there are tons of

98
00:03:45.26 --> 00:03:49.490
examples timchenko rosenberg Kovalchuk

99
00:03:47.81 --> 00:03:51.170
sham all of it can be definitely said

100
00:03:49.49 --> 00:03:53.360
that if you are putin's friends you are

101
00:03:51.17 --> 00:03:54.920
doing all right indeed many of these

102
00:03:53.36 --> 00:03:56.870
people appear in the Forbes list of the

103
00:03:54.92 --> 00:03:58.280
wealthiest people in the world and it is

104
00:03:56.87 --> 00:03:59.450
not just them I mean these people

105
00:03:58.28 --> 00:04:00.920
they're now getting old and they are

106
00:03:59.45 --> 00:04:02.510
passing on their wealth to their

107
00:04:00.92 --> 00:04:04.459
children it is normal to see many of

108
00:04:02.51 --> 00:04:06.110
these big national companies that have

109
00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.600
grown enormously since Putin reached

110
00:04:06.11 --> 00:04:16.910
power to being run by the 25 to 35 year

111
00:04:08.6 --> 00:04:18.440
old children of Putin's friends take a

112
00:04:16.91 --> 00:04:20.359
look at Nikolai Shamanov a

113
00:04:18.44 --> 00:04:22.610
multi-millionaire Friends of Putin and

114
00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.410
his two children one of them yuri became

115
00:04:22.61 --> 00:04:26.390
the CEO of gas ponds one of the most

116
00:04:24.41 --> 00:04:28.010
important retirement funds in Russia

117
00:04:26.39 --> 00:04:29.960
the other Kirill he was the vice

118
00:04:28.01 --> 00:04:31.760
president of saboom they large state

119
00:04:29.96 --> 00:04:34.490
controls petrochemical company when he

120
00:04:31.76 --> 00:04:36.590
was just 25 years old by the way Kirill

121
00:04:34.49 --> 00:04:38.270
married Putin's daughter soon after and

122
00:04:36.59 --> 00:04:40.070
you know what he's now the wealthiest

123
00:04:38.27 --> 00:04:42.770
young person in Russia with a fortune

124
00:04:40.07 --> 00:04:44.780
exceeding 1 billion dollars indeed the

125
00:04:42.77 --> 00:04:46.310
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has been

126
00:04:44.78 --> 00:04:48.110
accused of getting rich from the state

127
00:04:46.31 --> 00:04:50.180
and having palaces and vineyards all

128
00:04:48.11 --> 00:04:51.950
over Russia I'm actually going to link

129
00:04:50.18 --> 00:04:53.330
to a documentary that exposed all of

130
00:04:51.95 --> 00:04:55.760
this in the description below it is

131
00:04:53.33 --> 00:04:57.830
absolutely worth a watch and so now you

132
00:04:55.76 --> 00:04:59.720
might be wondering why is Putin doing

133
00:04:57.83 --> 00:05:02.539
all of this is he just a really generous

134
00:04:59.72 --> 00:05:04.910
dude well whether he is or not that is

135
00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.800
not his real goal here he's not just

136
00:05:04.91 --> 00:05:10.220
making his friends rich because they are

137
00:05:06.8 --> 00:05:11.930
his friends what Putin is trying to do

138
00:05:10.22 --> 00:05:14.030
with this strategy is grant himself

139
00:05:11.93 --> 00:05:16.460
control over the resources of the state

140
00:05:14.03 --> 00:05:18.860
as well who's paying for this well that

141
00:05:16.46 --> 00:05:20.960
would be these citizens of Russia all

142
00:05:18.86 --> 00:05:22.640
right so we have oligarchy repression

143
00:05:20.96 --> 00:05:24.440
religion propaganda full state control

144
00:05:22.64 --> 00:05:27.050
control overall economic and political

145
00:05:24.44 --> 00:05:29.270
issues in Russian society and these make

146
00:05:27.05 --> 00:05:31.820
up the main ingredients of the political

147
00:05:29.27 --> 00:05:33.830
regime created by this new czar and it

148
00:05:31.82 --> 00:05:35.510
goes beyond any ideological reproach

149
00:05:33.83 --> 00:05:37.450
look at what Owen Jones a famous

150
00:05:35.51 --> 00:05:39.680
left-wing British person had to say a

151
00:05:37.45 --> 00:05:42.320
right-wing authoritarian leader who

152
00:05:39.68 --> 00:05:43.970
attacks of liberties stigmatizes lesbian

153
00:05:42.32 --> 00:05:46.400
gay bisexual and transgender people

154
00:05:43.97 --> 00:05:47.560
indulges in chauvinistic nationalism is

155
00:05:46.4 --> 00:05:49.180
in bed with rapacious

156
00:05:47.56 --> 00:05:51.370
oligarchs and who is admired by the

157
00:05:49.18 --> 00:05:53.440
European and American hard right Russia

158
00:05:51.37 --> 00:05:55.780
is ruled by a human rights abusing

159
00:05:53.44 --> 00:05:57.190
expansionist oligarchic regime the

160
00:05:55.78 --> 00:05:58.360
Russian people and their neighbors

161
00:05:57.19 --> 00:06:00.250
deserve better

162
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:01.780
Owen Jones and well now you might be

163
00:06:00.25 --> 00:06:03.280
wondering yeah but what about outside of

164
00:06:01.78 --> 00:06:05.200
Russia I mean how much power does

165
00:06:03.28 --> 00:06:07.060
Vladimir Putin command on the world

166
00:06:05.2 --> 00:06:08.770
stage well as we already said in a

167
00:06:07.06 --> 00:06:11.470
previous video about China we can

168
00:06:08.77 --> 00:06:14.350
understand power as influence and we can

169
00:06:11.47 --> 00:06:23.580
observe three branches military economic

170
00:06:14.35 --> 00:06:26.110
and political the rebirth of a Titan

171
00:06:23.58 --> 00:06:27.700
Vladimir Putin turns Russia into one of

172
00:06:26.11 --> 00:06:29.830
the countries with the highest relative

173
00:06:27.7 --> 00:06:31.510
spend on the military way above China

174
00:06:29.83 --> 00:06:33.070
and the USA just take a look at this

175
00:06:31.51 --> 00:06:34.900
chart while the u.s. is spending

176
00:06:33.07 --> 00:06:37.030
approximately 9% of the government's

177
00:06:34.9 --> 00:06:39.400
budget and China is spending around 6%

178
00:06:37.03 --> 00:06:41.380
Russia is spending more than 15% of the

179
00:06:39.4 --> 00:06:44.139
budget supporting the army right after

180
00:06:41.38 --> 00:06:46.630
the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990s

181
00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.340
the image of Russian forces was of rusty

182
00:06:46.63 --> 00:06:50.290
boats planes that couldn't fly and

183
00:06:48.34 --> 00:06:51.669
corrupt officials who liked to empty

184
00:06:50.29 --> 00:06:52.720
their Arsenal's to sell the weapons on

185
00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.669
the black market

186
00:06:52.72 --> 00:06:56.350
Putin well he wanted to change that and

187
00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.070
today things they are very very

188
00:06:56.35 --> 00:06:59.950
different

189
00:06:58.07 --> 00:07:02.570
[Music]

190
00:06:59.95 --> 00:07:04.940
since Putin reached power and especially

191
00:07:02.57 --> 00:07:07.220
since 2008 Putin has made it a priority

192
00:07:04.94 --> 00:07:09.140
to update the army so in the last few

193
00:07:07.22 --> 00:07:10.940
years they have spent tens of billions

194
00:07:09.14 --> 00:07:13.310
of dollars turning the old Russian army

195
00:07:10.94 --> 00:07:14.660
into a modern military force but even

196
00:07:13.31 --> 00:07:16.430
more important than that is that they

197
00:07:14.66 --> 00:07:17.090
have made serious upgrades to their

198
00:07:16.43 --> 00:07:19.550
firepower

199
00:07:17.09 --> 00:07:21.760
planes missiles ships they are all being

200
00:07:19.55 --> 00:07:21.760
updated

201
00:07:22.87 --> 00:07:27.280
look closely in 2015 alone according to

202
00:07:25.81 --> 00:07:29.500
the figures of the Russian Ministry of

203
00:07:27.28 --> 00:07:32.470
Defense - the army got four ships for

204
00:07:29.5 --> 00:07:36.010
submarines 52 support ships 27 aircrafts

205
00:07:32.47 --> 00:07:38.889
and 45 artillery units but not everyone

206
00:07:36.01 --> 00:07:40.780
shares this opinion in fact one former

207
00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:42.220
US general told me that a single US

208
00:07:40.78 --> 00:07:43.930
super aircraft carrier group could

209
00:07:42.22 --> 00:07:45.250
obliterate the entire Russian Navy as

210
00:07:43.93 --> 00:07:46.360
the equipment is so dated and

211
00:07:45.25 --> 00:07:48.820
technologically obsolete

212
00:07:46.36 --> 00:07:50.220
Azeem Ibraheim research professor at the

213
00:07:48.82 --> 00:07:52.510
United States Army War College

214
00:07:50.22 --> 00:07:54.070
regardless we could say the Russian army

215
00:07:52.51 --> 00:07:55.900
has become a key part of Moscow's

216
00:07:54.07 --> 00:07:57.370
international politics and it is not

217
00:07:55.9 --> 00:07:59.350
just this political influence in other

218
00:07:57.37 --> 00:08:01.810
countries and international conflicts

219
00:07:59.35 --> 00:08:04.210
but also the renewed capacity of the

220
00:08:01.81 --> 00:08:05.680
Russian arms industry further do you not

221
00:08:04.21 --> 00:08:15.120
forget about all those nukes they have

222
00:08:05.68 --> 00:08:18.010
they have a lot of nukes feet of clay

223
00:08:15.12 --> 00:08:19.930
now if we can see the Russian army as an

224
00:08:18.01 --> 00:08:21.699
asset for Putin the wrecked Russian

225
00:08:19.93 --> 00:08:24.160
economy is certainly his main weakness

226
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:25.930
Russia is basically a producer and an

227
00:08:24.16 --> 00:08:27.910
exporter of natural resources and

228
00:08:25.93 --> 00:08:29.830
Russia's economy is nowhere even close

229
00:08:27.91 --> 00:08:32.409
to China's in the last few decades

230
00:08:29.83 --> 00:08:34.570
Russia has been unable to diversify or

231
00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.680
develop a complex and productive economy

232
00:08:34.57 --> 00:08:38.169
not even close

233
00:08:35.68 --> 00:08:39.789
Russia is more and more dependent on its

234
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.560
natural resources every day

235
00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.240
indeed they are so dependent on them

236
00:08:41.56 --> 00:08:45.040
that everything is great when the prices

237
00:08:43.24 --> 00:08:46.959
are high birds when they are not a

238
00:08:45.04 --> 00:08:48.820
crisis kicks off these are Barack

239
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:51.430
Obama's words from his final press

240
00:08:48.82 --> 00:08:53.440
conference as president the Russians

241
00:08:51.43 --> 00:08:55.150
can't change us or significantly weaken

242
00:08:53.44 --> 00:08:56.770
us there is smaller country they are a

243
00:08:55.15 --> 00:08:58.690
weaker country their economy doesn't

244
00:08:56.77 --> 00:09:01.000
produce anything that anybody wants to

245
00:08:58.69 --> 00:09:02.920
buy except oil and gas and arms they

246
00:09:01.0 --> 00:09:04.930
don't innovate Barack Obama and the

247
00:09:02.92 --> 00:09:06.730
oligarchy states that Putin as creators

248
00:09:04.93 --> 00:09:08.589
has a lot to do with it the state has

249
00:09:06.73 --> 00:09:10.959
simply taken a more and more important

250
00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:13.720
role in the economy since 2005 it was

251
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:15.339
then 35 percent and today it is 70

252
00:09:13.72 --> 00:09:17.560
percent and let us not forget that this

253
00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:19.420
process has been led by putin's buddies

254
00:09:17.56 --> 00:09:21.430
and sure in this situation I mean of

255
00:09:19.42 --> 00:09:23.320
course corruption spreads in competition

256
00:09:21.43 --> 00:09:25.000
disappears and with those things gone

257
00:09:23.32 --> 00:09:26.620
there's not really much of an incentive

258
00:09:25.0 --> 00:09:28.540
for them to do things right and that's

259
00:09:26.62 --> 00:09:30.430
why the future of Russia's economy it's

260
00:09:28.54 --> 00:09:33.430
looking pretty bleak on some proof of

261
00:09:30.43 --> 00:09:34.959
this run in 2016 more than 400,000

262
00:09:33.43 --> 00:09:36.100
people left the country and many of

263
00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:37.930
these people were the

264
00:09:36.1 --> 00:09:39.370
and educate it anyway the Russian model

265
00:09:37.93 --> 00:09:41.050
it just doesn't seem capable of

266
00:09:39.37 --> 00:09:42.850
encouraging growth and development in

267
00:09:41.05 --> 00:09:45.130
the country and besides think about it

268
00:09:42.85 --> 00:09:47.019
this is a weakness itself a poor economy

269
00:09:45.13 --> 00:09:48.970
means less influence and less potential

270
00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:50.410
to develop the military and finally the

271
00:09:48.97 --> 00:09:52.269
third branch and that's political power

272
00:09:50.41 --> 00:09:54.040
we could discuss further the moves with

273
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:55.480
China or the Russian strategy in the

274
00:09:54.04 --> 00:09:56.829
Middle East where Moscow is trying to

275
00:09:55.48 --> 00:09:59.019
take influence from no less than the

276
00:09:56.829 --> 00:10:01.480
United States but I think we should

277
00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:03.130
leave that for a future video so now we

278
00:10:01.48 --> 00:10:04.930
wonder what's your opinion what do you

279
00:10:03.13 --> 00:10:06.699
think about Vladimir Putin do you agree

280
00:10:04.93 --> 00:10:08.470
with us disagree well leave your answers
