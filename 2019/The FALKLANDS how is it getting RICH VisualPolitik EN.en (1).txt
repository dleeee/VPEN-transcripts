[Applause]

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,800
when we think of the Falkland Islands we

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,540
tend to think of them as a cluster of

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,570
remote and inhospitable islands located

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,820
about 400 kilometres from the wilds of

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,800
Patagonia the Falklands are made up of

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,410
more than 700 islands but cover an area

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,260
approximately 12,000 square kilometres

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,060
big making them bigger than Puerto Rico

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,930
Cyprus or Lebanon yet despite their size

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,940
can you guess how many people live there

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,219
well it's only about three and a half

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,379
thousand Marines that the population

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,030
density works out to about one

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,219
inhabitant for every four square

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,680
kilometers whispers the Falklands in the

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
top three least inhabited autonomous

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,239
territories on the planet right up there

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,039
with Greenland's and thus far barred

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:01,079
Arctic Archipelago

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,180
but another way it's home to more

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,670
penguins than it is to people to give

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,770
you an idea of just how few people that

24
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,080
is picture a football stadium like

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,270
Wembley you could fit the entire

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,430
population of the Falkland Islands into

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,580
the stadium 26 times over

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,350
apart from being almost uninhabited they

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,390
are also known for their ongoing dispute

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,979
with Argentina which claims that the

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,930
islands are part of their own territory

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,520
and as Argentina is their closest

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,229
neighbor this tense relationship makes

34
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,450
the Falkland Islands very isolated

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,420
indeed

36
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,320
[Music]

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,420
hence well I got us wondering what

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,790
exactly drives the falklands economy why

39
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,530
are the islands in this controversial

40
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,630
tug of war and can such a small

41
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,510
territory survive on its own now what if

42
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,860
I told you that the Falklands could

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,900
become one of the richest territories in

44
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,150
the world don't believe me well listen

45
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:08,149
up what do the Falklands live off let me

46
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,740
ask you a question could you name the

47
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,660
richest autonomous territory in Latin

48
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,250
America right now you're probably

49
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,660
thinking Puerto Rico

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,870
maybe Chile or Panama well actually no

51
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,459
with a gross domestic product of more

52
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,650
than 60,000 US dollars per capita the

53
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,060
Falkland Islands of the wealthiest

54
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,220
territory in Latin America in fact we're

55
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,530
talking about almost five times the GDP

56
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,180
per capita of Argentina

57
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,420
[Music]

58
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,959
and yes I know that the Falklands aren't

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,180
technically a country but they do have

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,370
their own governmental institutions and

61
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,110
a decent amount of say in the running of

62
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,330
the islands in practical terms they kind

63
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,950
of are a country and their economy is

64
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,040
actually going from strength to strength

65
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,510
you see despite being isolated and

66
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,190
practically uninhabited in the last

67
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,900
decade the islands have averaged an

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,730
annual economic growth of more than five

69
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,680
percent in real terms and not only that

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,720
unlike other Latin American governments

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,310
and let's face it almost all the

72
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,660
governments in the world the local

73
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,130
authorities have not only managed to

74
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,080
keep the country debt-free but they also

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,660
hold reserves something like a sovereign

76
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,510
funds of more than 250 million American

77
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,280
dollars now that might not sound like a

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,019
huge amount of money but distributed

79
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,280
across the tiny population the

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,970
government savings equate to more than

81
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,950
$75,000 per inhabitants okay let's go

82
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,870
back to our original question and thus

83
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,970
where did this money come from and

84
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,989
something you might be thinking right

85
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,760
now well Simon come on the Falkland

86
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,260
Islands they belong to the United

87
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,850
Kingdom surely they've been heavily

88
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,040
subsidizing them and the public sex has

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,690
got to be the most significant activity

90
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,320
right well surprisingly the answer's no

91
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,860
not at all

92
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:09,580
[Music]

93
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,400
[Applause]

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,280
we have absolutely no doubt about their

95
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,989
sovereignty which has been continuous

96
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,150
since 1833 Margaret Thatcher the

97
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,130
Falklands are actually a self-sufficient

98
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,109
Territory the United Kingdom only takes

99
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,000
care of defense spending and nothing

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,100
more and those costs they on that high

101
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,870
and they wouldn't even be necessary if

102
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,190
it weren't for the ongoing political

103
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,980
conflict over sovereignty

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:40,460
[Music]

105
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,290
you see the harsh environment it made

106
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,420
the Falkland Islands relatively poor so

107
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,580
poor they were probably doomed to be

108
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,190
depopulated but in 1987 all of that

109
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,750
changed the inhabitants of the island

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,370
realized that they had to create income

111
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,200
if they wanted to stay and so they

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,180
became business savvy and when it comes

113
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,680
to doing business that British they're

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:10,340
great role models so formally Vedas

123
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,240
oestrus first Oh Margaret Thatcher the

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,990
change of rules had been notified at the

125
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,740
end of April

126
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,280
[Music]

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,350
in 1987 the island's local government

128
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,030
began to sell licenses to foreign

129
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,410
fishing companies allowing them to

130
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,390
operate within the Falklands maritime

131
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,190
territory in this way they began to

132
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,900
treat their waters as if they were any

133
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,940
other resource this practice it's proven

134
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,410
lucrative and the government's collects

135
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,210
a lot of revenue from it every single

136
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,580
year what's more Falkland Islanders very

137
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,770
concerned with fishing sustainability so

138
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,420
this source of income isn't about to run

139
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:11,260
out anytime soon but it does not end

140
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,990
there since the 1980s three things have

141
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,790
been very clear to the Falklands

142
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,290
government firstly they need to

143
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,970
encourage business creation and

144
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,920
encourage initiatives the Falklands

145
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,140
inhabitants who all know each other to

146
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,400
live off the fruits of their own labor

147
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,290
not from taxes and public spending

148
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,390
secondly to make that possible taxes

149
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,460
need to be moderate and that they are

150
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,010
foreign fingers no taxes on purchases on

151
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,870
the islands and excise taxes are also

152
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,910
low petrol is actually cheaper than it

153
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,680
is in the United Kingdom so if a person

154
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,030
earns say two thousand five hundred

155
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,770
American dollars a month they'll pay a

156
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,870
total of a hundred and forty dollars per

157
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,940
month in taxes which is less than six

158
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,039
percent

159
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,080
and thirdly the local government not

160
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,729
only doesn't need to borrow they

161
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,249
actually have savings debt there was no

162
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,110
room on these islands for debt as you

163
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,909
can see from this chart you could say

164
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,160
that the Islanders believe in surpluses

165
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,409
[Music]

166
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,729
so the Falklands inhabitants they're not

167
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,379
only freed from paying taxes and public

168
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,149
debt the sovereign funds savings

169
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,069
accumulate from year to year which means

170
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,719
funds are available whenever public

171
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:15,430
works and need it for example they are

172
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,990
currently building a new port and

173
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,479
expanding the airport another benefit to

174
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,949
all of this is that there's no

175
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,020
unemployment in the Falklands and ninety

176
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,699
percent of working-age people have a job

177
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,259
in recent years new industries such as

178
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,180
tourism and fish farming they've taken

179
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,550
off the economy is doing so well and the

180
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,960
work opportunities are so attractive

181
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,430
that the government is preparing for an

182
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,110
influx of foreign workers which could

183
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,789
see the islands population dull in the

184
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,830
next few years the downside is being so

185
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,419
isolated and with such a small

186
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,129
population that Amazon doesn't deliver

187
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,689
the Internet is slower than a turtle

188
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,969
with arthritis and of course unless you

189
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,189
like nature there's not a whole lot to

190
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,589
do but this is all just a taste of what

191
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:55,910
may still beat cancer listen up

193
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,990
Road to wealth

194
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,850
it's clear the falklands inhabitants

195
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,440
have managed their situation very well

196
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,780
this tells us that even in such a small

197
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,669
and isolated territory success is

198
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,740
possible when decisions are made based

199
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,080
on careful forethought and it's not as

200
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,430
if you have to reinvent the wheel here

201
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,530
there are plenty of cautionary tales to

202
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,680
pull from yes young dilemma yes sir

203
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,710
see there but even though things are

204
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,029
already going well the fate of the

205
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:34,500
falklands inhabitants is about to

206
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,779
catapult right into the stratosphere

207
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,459
check this out in 1993 the British

208
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,620
Geological Centre located oil just off

209
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,779
the coast of this archipelago

210
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,220
exploitable oil after years of intense

211
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,170
preparation the project it can now start

212
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,399
bearing fruit to small British oil

213
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,589
companies Rockhopper exploration premier

214
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:57,209
oil are allowed to start building the

215
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,440
infrastructure that will allow the

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,390
Falkland Islands to produce oil the

217
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,120
forecasts are that they will surpass

218
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,470
80,000 barrels per day in just three

219
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,920
years

220
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,839
so they only need the price of all to

221
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,240
remain above $45 per barrel to make this

222
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,440
business profitable now 80,000 barrels

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,660
it might not seem like a lot but don't

224
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,070
forget we're talking about a territory

225
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,810
with just over three thousand

226
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,940
inhabitants 80,000 barrels at the

227
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,470
current price of 60 US dollars per

228
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,329
barrel means an annual income of around

229
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,430
one point eight billion dollars nine

230
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,440
percent of that income and 26 percent of

231
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
the final profits obtained by the oil

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,589
companies will go to the local

233
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:33,360
government we're talking about a number

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,970
that will probably surpassed 200 million

235
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,829
u.s. dollars in public income alone that

236
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,660
equates to about 60,000 additional

237
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,399
dollars per inhabitants every single

238
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,320
year and let's not forget about the

239
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,660
extra jobs services and taxes that are

240
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,540
being brought in by this new industry

241
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:56,340
[Music]

242
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,380
and this is only the beginning because

243
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,660
acceleration is still underway if things

244
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,370
go well the falklands daily production

245
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,560
could well exceed a hundred thousand

246
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,200
barrels per day within just 10 years all

247
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,150
in it's estimated that this archipelagos

248
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,160
total exploitable oil reserves could

249
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,470
exceed a billion barrels and if this is

250
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,970
the case in just a few years these

251
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,830
islands could become one of the richest

252
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,400
places on the planet I can assure that

253
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,930
one thing would never change our

254
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,790
absolute commitment to the people and

255
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,380
sovereignty of the Falkland Islands

256
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
Theresa May today the Falklands they may

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,610
seem inhospitable but with employment

258
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,770
opportunities good salaries low taxes

259
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,540
improved communications that solid legal

260
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,610
framework hardly any corruption many

261
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,410
civil liberties and a lots of security

262
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,300
our impression about life on these

263
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,520
islands in mind well change especially

264
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,110
when compared to the situation in other

265
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,210
countries on the American continent so

266
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,860
folks that's how things stand today in

267
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,050
the Falklands or as the Argentinians

268
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,480
call them the Malvinas of course apart

269
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,100
from the issue of sovereignty which we

270
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,080
looked at in a past video if forecasts

271
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,640
are met these islands could become a

272
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,740
business hub for the southern regions of

273
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,420
Argentina maybe the time has come to

274
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,270
just put old quarrels to rest and share

275
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,510
the good fortune

276
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,910
when I met President Macri earlier this

277
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,680
month becoming the first British Prime

278
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,660
Minister to ever visit Buenos Aires it

279
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,910
was a pleasure to focus not just on what

280
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,380
separates us but on what we can achieve

281
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,190
together

282
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,529
