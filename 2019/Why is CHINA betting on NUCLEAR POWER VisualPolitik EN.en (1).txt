00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:09,510
nuclear power is like adult

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,219
entertainment a lot of people say that

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,130
they don't like it then you do find it

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,450
pretty much everywhere maybe I thought

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,430
the nuclear power it wasn't fashionable

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,630
anymore maybe you thought that after

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,939
Fukushima the whole world's just started

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,400
showing it's back to nuclear power well

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,420
in fact the opposite is true

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,000
[Music]

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,099
in fact if you're watching this video in

14
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,980
America in the UK or well any European

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,899
country the chances are that you're

16
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,449
consuming nuclear power at this very

17
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,730
moment and I know what you're gonna say

18
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,050
you're gonna say oh come on Simon you're

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,980
exaggerating

20
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,230
most countries don't have nuclear power

21
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,210
plants right I mean in fact there are

22
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,730
only 30 countries with nuclear reactors

23
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,409
this means that just one out of every

24
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,960
six or seven countries has it but think

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,760
about it many of those countries they're

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,769
really small as you can imagine or

27
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,329
Vanuatu doesn't have the same power

28
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,810
needs as China

29
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,680
[Music]

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,150
if we're talking about the biggest

31
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,950
economies those with membership in the

32
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,040
g20 only five of them have no reactors

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,440
and of those Turkey is starting to build

34
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,210
their own facilities and Italy imports

35
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,950
10% of their energy from the nuclear

36
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,500
power plants in France so let's face it

37
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,870
most wealthy countries use nuclear power

38
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,180
and the emerging ones they're starting

39
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,130
to join the club too especially China

40
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,870
you see there are three indicators for

41
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,460
determining whether a country will adopt

42
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,890
a nuclear power that go hand in hand

43
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,320
economic growth more power demands and

44
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,229
more pollution so imagine for a moment

45
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,570
Chinese factories demanding more and

46
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,670
more energy than add to this the heavy

47
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,560
migration from villages to cities and

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,380
blew all of a sudden we have thousands

49
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,180
of officers thousands of factories

50
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,670
thousands of malls and millions of

51
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,229
Chinese people turning on their lights

52
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,020
at the exact same time

53
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,630
[Music]

54
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,190
cities like Beijing Shanghai Shenzhen

55
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,200
they make American cities look like

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,630
small villages in the Alps so just

57
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,330
imagine how much power these cities need

58
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,030
of course this explains why China is

59
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,490
becoming a green energy Disneyland they

60
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,530
can't stop building solar panels wind

61
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,870
turbines and hydroelectric plants year

62
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,970
after year China is leading investments

63
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,190
in renewable energy sources and you

64
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,720
would think that after Fukushima they're

65
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,760
no longer interested in nuclear but

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,400
you'd be absolutely wrong according to

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,110
the International Atomic Energy Agency

68
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,720
Asia is where half of all new reactors

69
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,520
are being built and look we're not

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,170
talking about three or four in total

71
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,290
here more than 27 reactors are currently

72
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,360
being built and most of them they're in

73
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,300
China

74
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,090
[Music]

75
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,129
and I know you're thinking wait China's

76
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,200
a dictatorship right so the only reason

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,670
they're building that many reactors is

78
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,530
because they don't need to listen to

79
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,840
their people they can do whatever they

80
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,319
want

81
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,599
again you'd be wrong Asian citizens that

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,180
largely in support of nuclear power look

83
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,799
at Taiwan as an example it's a

84
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,660
democratic country and here they made a

85
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,950
referendum about whether they should

86
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,290
close nuclear reactors and the citizens

87
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,959
they said no even in Japan the hands of

88
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,209
Fukushima we're seeing news like this

89
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,040
hand Court rejects lawsuit against

90
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,140
construction of nuclear power plant so

91
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,480
the question is why what happened with

92
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,489
nuclear power that makes the Asians and

93
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,190
particularly the Chinese so excited what

94
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,660
are the main companies involved in this

95
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,610
and is it a good or is it a bad idea

96
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,590
well today we're going to answer all of

97
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,360
these questions but before we do let's

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,180
take a look back at the history

99
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,189
the sleeping dragon duro the dragon

100
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,049
smaug for the hobbit saving on top of

101
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,030
that mountain of goals well in Mao

102
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,099
Zedong's China now was that sleeping

103
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,989
dragon but instead of sleeping on wealth

104
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,540
and treasure he was sleeping on rice

105
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,239
China it was poor and agricultural and

106
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,459
this is how it rained for decades during

107
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,109
those times China was too poor to buy

108
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,090
the insanely pricey technology needed

109
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,040
for nuclear plants at the beginning of

110
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,349
the 1990s China had no reactors

111
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,260
whatsoever in 1990 the power mix in this

112
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,780
country was 20% hydro electric and 80%

113
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,190
fossil fuels mainly being cold

114
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,790
but then 2017 roll surrounds and things

115
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,680
changed of course China still relies on

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,620
coal but not as much why

117
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,480
well the coal produces the most

118
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,400
pollution of any energy source and this

119
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
explains why Beijing is so famous for

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,810
its more guns why people have to wear

121
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,000
masks that and don't get me wrong this

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,710
pollution won't change in the near

123
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,680
future especially with news like this

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,600
China coal power building boom sparks

125
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,340
climate warning think about it the only

126
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,070
natural resource China has is coal so

127
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,470
they can't just stop using it like that

128
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,090
but there is a problem

129
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,770
Colon's hydroelectric produced enough

130
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,380
power during Mao's time that in just 20

131
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,510
years energy consumption in China has

132
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,780
multiplied by 10 so essentially they

133
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,880
need other sources of energy and they

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,550
need them badly

135
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,430
[Music]

136
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,949
and this is why in just 27 years China

137
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,889
has built 40 brand new reactors that's

138
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,229
already more than Russia has so he could

139
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,060
say that the sleeping dragon isn't how

140
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,009
wide awake but okay okay we said that

141
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,599
China is investing a lot in green energy

142
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:28,150
too so well why do they still need

143
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,870
nuclear now let's have a look hungry for

144
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,300
uranium Smaug the dragon he loved goals

145
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,610
the Chinese dragon when it loves uranium

146
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,979
right now China is building 11 brand-new

147
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,599
reactors with a greater capacity than

148
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,539
all of the United Kingdom's reactors but

149
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:49,060
hold on a minute because this is nothing

150
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,560
just look at the expectations for 2030

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,479
China is set to overtake us as biggest

152
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,599
nuclear energy nation IEA says according

153
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,659
to the IEA China is set to overtake the

154
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,879
United States as the biggest nuclear

155
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,830
energy nation and I know we are now

156
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,870
thinking all of these predictions are

157
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,060
after the Fukushima incident in 2011

158
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,550
which was caused by a tsunami that hit a

159
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,379
nuclear power plant in Japan it was a

160
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,930
huge catastrophe forcing thousands of

161
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,639
people to move turning the water toxic

162
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,400
and making death a real and present

163
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,639
danger so why does China keep investing

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,190
in nuclear even after this has happens I

165
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,690
mean isn't green energy enough

166
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,310
[Music]

167
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,830
well here's the important thing the key

168
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,600
point when we're talking about energy is

169
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
that hardly any of it can be stored

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,100
maybe in the future lithium batteries

171
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,320
will improve but currently it's very

172
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,389
expensive to store electricity on a

173
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,430
large scale and this is the main problem

174
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,130
with green energy

175
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,699
[Music]

176
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,009
solar panels are good but what happens

177
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,960
at night wind turbines are great but

178
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,849
what do we do when there's no wind and

179
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:01,259
you gotta add to this what we said

180
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,930
before so far China relies too much on

181
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,270
coal because they don't have to import

182
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,460
it but all of this it causes a lot of

183
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,830
pollution so well what are the

184
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,199
alternatives well you might think what

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,689
about gas right now China reports 40

186
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,580
percent of the gas they use and this

187
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,099
creates a lot of political problems we

188
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,539
have a whole series of videos covering

189
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,969
the gas Wars besides gas in Asia is very

190
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:28,520
expensive because of things like this

191
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,159
and spa LNG price it's three-year high

192
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,650
in January basically China is constantly

193
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,270
competing with Japan to attract all

194
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,310
those ships with their liquefied natural

195
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,189
gas and this has increased the price a

196
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,050
lot so the reality is there's only

197
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,580
really one alternative and that's a

198
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,860
nuclear it's efficient people can use it

199
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,719
all day long and as counterintuitive as

200
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,870
it sounds it's less polluting but hold

201
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,189
on a minute because it's really not that

202
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,469
simple you see if you want to have nukes

203
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:58,349
you need two things you need some very

204
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,270
expensive technology and you need

205
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,310
uranium and the uranium isn't something

206
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,349
you can go and buy at the supermarket so

207
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,750
well how is China doing it well let me

208
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,320
tell you

209
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,450
[Music]

210
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,640
made in China China is famous for

211
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,250
copying products from the West so yes

212
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,840
you can imagine what we're going to say

213
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,450
right now where did China importance

214
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,430
nuclear technology from well of course

215
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,710
you learn from the best in the beginning

216
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,940
they started working with the French

217
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,010
nuclear BAM off from its home which you

218
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,570
might know by their old name a river

219
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,760
China also made deals with American

220
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,010
Westinghouse and the Russian rasa tahn

221
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,080
well well but this this was during the

222
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,880
1990s so what happened during the 2000s

223
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,530
[Music]

224
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,940
while China went to all of these

225
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,710
companies and said essentially well okay

226
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,690
guys from now on next to any of your

227
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,520
engineers there's got to be a Chinese

228
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,190
engineer this is how China gained all of

229
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,050
the technological secrets from the best

230
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,570
nuclear companies and I can tell what

231
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,160
you're thinking you're absolutely right

232
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,320
nobody apparently negotiates better than

233
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,780
the Chinese so after 10 years the third

234
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,520
generation of Chinese manufactured

235
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,950
nuclear reactors they're already here

236
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,280
[Music]

237
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,130
China's set to fire up world's first

238
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,480
ap1000 nuclear reactor yep

239
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,640
now China can build its own reactors

240
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
without the help of foreign companies

241
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,670
and even if the American Westinghouse

242
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,590
wanted to expand their presence in the

243
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,630
Chinese market they would have a really

244
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,660
hard time because of news like this

245
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,280
Westinghouse could be hurt by new US

246
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,950
curbs on nuclear exports but still there

247
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,320
is one thing you cannot copy and that's

248
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,870
uranium nuclear power plants they need

249
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,180
uranium as fuel and China does not

250
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,430
naturally have this resource so they've

251
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,340
got to import it

252
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,870
[Music]

253
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,390
but again remember China is really great

254
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,460
at making deals the world's main uranium

255
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,980
producer is Kazakhstan they produce 40

256
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,630
percent of all the uranium on the planet

257
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,360
and China already takes 50% of that they

258
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,070
also have some agreements with Canada

259
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,510
and they're trying to do the same thing

260
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,820
with Australia but well that's the easy

261
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,390
part

262
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,800
what makes China special is their

263
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,540
ability to make deals in even the most

264
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,680
challenging places

265
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,189
[Music]

266
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:18,529
China buys Rio Tinto steak in Namibia

267
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:24,649
uranium for 107 million dollars China

268
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,079
gains ground in Niger to get uranium to

269
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,879
increase their nuclear production

270
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,309
so in summary made in China has expanded

271
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,649
to the whole world but not only that

272
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,509
China's affordable technology is making

273
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,579
nuclear power available in places that

274
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:39,499
it was impossible to get it before

275
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:40,939
for example the crown jewel of this

276
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,769
brand-new industry is the halong one

277
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,509
reactor this will be used in countries

278
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,119
like Argentina and Pakistan which are

279
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,379
going to start using more and more

280
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,480
nuclear power - but this isn't just

281
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,730
about the emerging world the state-owned

282
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,709
Chinese nuclear company is participating

283
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:55,999
in the construction of a brand new

284
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,249
reactor in the United Kingdom but well

285
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:00,769
that's a story for another video as you

286
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,629
might have already guessed this is just

287
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,220
the first chapter of another series of

288
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,990
videos we're going to be doing about the

289
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,029
comeback of a nuclear power if you don't

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,480
where do you think that Chinese nuclear

295
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,279
ambitions will lead do you think they'll

296
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,619
keep building nuclear plants or will

297
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,239
they focus most of their efforts into

298
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,279
developing more green energy well leave
