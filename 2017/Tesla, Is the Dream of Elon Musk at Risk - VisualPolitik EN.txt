thiel the famous Silicon Valley investor

00:00:14.61 --> 00:00:18.150
who we've talked about before joins the

7
00:00:16.77 --> 00:00:19.740
legions of people who consider that

8
00:00:18.15 --> 00:00:21.600
innovation in the past few years has

9
00:00:19.74 --> 00:00:23.970
slowed down somewhat although at the

10
00:00:21.6 --> 00:00:27.260
time of great revolutionary inventions

11
00:00:23.97 --> 00:00:27.260
seems to have been left behind

00:00:37.76 --> 00:00:44.280
anonymous for a stationary ask unanimous

14
00:00:41.91 --> 00:00:46.110
a good example of this slowdown can be

15
00:00:44.28 --> 00:00:48.120
found in the automobile industry an

16
00:00:46.11 --> 00:00:48.780
industry that has been pretty static for

17
00:00:48.12 --> 00:00:50.970
decades

18
00:00:48.78 --> 00:00:53.580
yes cars nowadays are better than 10 to

19
00:00:50.97 --> 00:00:55.739
20 years ago that's for sure but they

20
00:00:53.58 --> 00:00:57.780
are basically the same and they largely

21
00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.309
work in the same way in fact there is

22
00:00:57.78 --> 00:01:01.290
nothing substantial that you can do with

23
00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.080
a car today that you couldn't do 20 or

24
00:01:01.29 --> 00:01:06.750
30 years ago and of course cars still

25
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:09.640
don't fly may we present the Saab 95

[Music]

31
00:01:29.58 --> 00:01:32.490
and we're not talking about a simple

32
00:01:30.93 --> 00:01:34.890
industry here but one of the biggest

33
00:01:32.49 --> 00:01:36.420
industries in the world however do hold

34
00:01:34.89 --> 00:01:38.700
on a second here because everything

35
00:01:36.42 --> 00:01:40.650
suggests that finally we are on the

36
00:01:38.7 --> 00:01:42.570
verge of a great revolution in the realm

37
00:01:40.65 --> 00:01:44.520
of cars a transformation that many

38
00:01:42.57 --> 00:01:46.320
experts have compared to the one in the

39
00:01:44.52 --> 00:01:48.360
early 20th century that was engineered

40
00:01:46.32 --> 00:01:52.550
by Henry Ford where he began to use

41
00:01:48.36 --> 00:01:52.550
assembly lines to mass-produce cars

42
00:01:57.5 --> 00:02:02.000
well today this new revolution seems to

43
00:01:59.99 --> 00:02:04.040
have two key features the electric car

44
00:02:02.0 --> 00:02:06.140
and the autonomous car and here dear

45
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:07.850
viewer we have an unquestionable star a

46
00:02:06.14 --> 00:02:10.130
company that is managed to start

47
00:02:07.85 --> 00:02:12.290
changing things and knows how to win the

48
00:02:10.13 --> 00:02:14.690
admiration of the many people who see it

49
00:02:12.29 --> 00:02:16.700
as an example of a new era that is about

50
00:02:14.69 --> 00:02:18.770
to begin we are of course talking about

51
00:02:16.7 --> 00:02:21.080
Tesla the company of electric cars that

52
00:02:18.77 --> 00:02:26.810
has managed to dazzle investors as well

53
00:02:21.08 --> 00:02:28.940
as governments and their consumers in

54
00:02:26.81 --> 00:02:30.680
this video we are going to see what kind

55
00:02:28.94 --> 00:02:34.990
of challengers Tesla is going to face in

56
00:02:30.68 --> 00:02:34.990
the coming years so let's dive in a

57
00:02:37.45 --> 00:02:45.020
history of wine and roses Tesla is a

58
00:02:42.5 --> 00:02:46.550
very young company it was born in 2003

59
00:02:45.02 --> 00:02:48.500
with the mission of producing an

60
00:02:46.55 --> 00:02:51.350
electric car capable of competing and

61
00:02:48.5 --> 00:02:53.330
defeating combustion engines since then

62
00:02:51.35 --> 00:02:55.640
it has managed you basically put on the

63
00:02:53.33 --> 00:02:58.130
market for models the Tesla Roadster the

64
00:02:55.64 --> 00:02:59.260
Model S the Model X and the newcomer the

65
00:02:58.13 --> 00:03:03.280
model 3

66
00:02:59.26 --> 00:03:05.890
[Music]

67
00:03:03.28 --> 00:03:08.260
seems to be a rather few right well

68
00:03:05.89 --> 00:03:10.210
despite this in 2010 the company went

69
00:03:08.26 --> 00:03:12.280
public and you know what happens well

70
00:03:10.21 --> 00:03:14.260
Tesla it's become one of the markets

71
00:03:12.28 --> 00:03:17.560
stars in these years the price of their

72
00:03:14.26 --> 00:03:19.510
shares has multiplied by 18 yes just

73
00:03:17.56 --> 00:03:21.370
like that in 2010 if you had invested a

74
00:03:19.51 --> 00:03:24.640
thousand dollars in Tesla's shares today

75
00:03:21.37 --> 00:03:26.050
you would have $18,000 a pretty amazing

76
00:03:24.64 --> 00:03:28.210
investments all this growth has led

77
00:03:26.05 --> 00:03:30.220
Tesla to fight for first place among the

78
00:03:28.21 --> 00:03:32.490
most valuable companies in the United

79
00:03:30.22 --> 00:03:32.490
States

80
00:03:34.04 --> 00:03:37.640
at the time of publishing this video if

81
00:03:36.11 --> 00:03:39.950
you want to buy us well prepare your

82
00:03:37.64 --> 00:03:43.069
wallet because Tesla is worth more than

83
00:03:39.95 --> 00:03:45.319
50 billion dollars this is more than the

84
00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.930
value of Ford by the way and they're not

85
00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.760
that far off General Motors just have a

86
00:03:47.93 --> 00:03:51.760
look at this chart from Business Insider

87
00:03:55.58 --> 00:04:00.170
what do you think not bad right this is

88
00:03:58.31 --> 00:04:01.760
especially the case if we take into

89
00:04:00.17 --> 00:04:04.010
account that it is a company that is

90
00:04:01.76 --> 00:04:07.270
barely 14 years old and that well

91
00:04:04.01 --> 00:04:09.710
honestly doesn't sell that many cars

92
00:04:07.27 --> 00:04:12.080
General Motors it sells 10 million cars

93
00:04:09.71 --> 00:04:13.460
each year and Ford exceeds six million

94
00:04:12.08 --> 00:04:18.670
but in 2016

95
00:04:13.46 --> 00:04:20.989
Tesla managed to sell just 76,000 cars

96
00:04:18.67 --> 00:04:23.060
alright so okay many of you are probably

97
00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.550
thinking right now well come on Tesla

98
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:28.610
they only sell luxury cars and yes that

99
00:04:25.55 --> 00:04:31.340
is true but it's still just 76,000 cars

100
00:04:28.61 --> 00:04:35.610
which is three times less than Porsche

101
00:04:31.34 --> 00:04:38.199
[Music]

102
00:04:35.61 --> 00:04:41.380
this is well explains why General Motors

103
00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.630
sales in 2016 were almost 170 billion

104
00:04:41.38 --> 00:04:49.660
dollars while Tesla remains well below

105
00:04:43.63 --> 00:04:50.860
at just 10 billion dollars I do not

106
00:04:49.66 --> 00:04:52.870
think that what is happening is Tesla

107
00:04:50.86 --> 00:04:55.210
has very high margins and is earning a

108
00:04:52.87 --> 00:04:57.100
lot of money not at all in fact in fact

109
00:04:55.21 --> 00:04:59.889
since the company was founded it has not

110
00:04:57.1 --> 00:05:01.750
earned money in any single yeah so this

111
00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.220
point you're probably wondering well why

112
00:05:01.75 --> 00:05:04.810
then is it worth so much money on the

113
00:05:03.22 --> 00:05:07.210
stock market why has it been so

114
00:05:04.81 --> 00:05:12.610
successful there and why indeed is this

115
00:05:07.21 --> 00:05:14.110
company so famous well the answer to

116
00:05:12.61 --> 00:05:15.370
that is that the company has a lot to do

117
00:05:14.11 --> 00:05:17.020
with the revolution that's happening in

118
00:05:15.37 --> 00:05:18.880
the industry that we commented on before

119
00:05:17.02 --> 00:05:20.890
and that's the introduction of electric

120
00:05:18.88 --> 00:05:28.310
and autonomous vehicles

121
00:05:20.89 --> 00:05:31.040
[Music]

122
00:05:28.31 --> 00:05:33.140
for example in 2016 there were more than

123
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:35.540
two million electric cars on the road

124
00:05:33.14 --> 00:05:37.310
60% more than in the previous year that

125
00:05:35.54 --> 00:05:39.290
is to say we are talking about markets

126
00:05:37.31 --> 00:05:41.510
that are growing incredibly quickly

127
00:05:39.29 --> 00:05:44.510
further technological advances have cut

128
00:05:41.51 --> 00:05:47.270
the price of this type of car forecast

129
00:05:44.51 --> 00:05:49.160
by Bloomberg New Energy Finance said

130
00:05:47.27 --> 00:05:50.690
that electric cars would become cheaper

131
00:05:49.16 --> 00:05:53.420
than conventional cars without

132
00:05:50.69 --> 00:05:55.670
government subsidies between 2025 and

133
00:05:53.42 --> 00:05:57.620
2030 and on the other hands many

134
00:05:55.67 --> 00:05:59.510
countries including China itself are

135
00:05:57.62 --> 00:06:01.340
betting on this technology as a way to

136
00:05:59.51 --> 00:06:03.440
reduce their pollution in cities and

137
00:06:01.34 --> 00:06:08.660
also as a way to reduce their dependence

138
00:06:03.44 --> 00:06:10.520
on foreign oil it's not often that

139
00:06:08.66 --> 00:06:12.590
environmental national security it come

140
00:06:10.52 --> 00:06:13.110
together in such a combination but here

141
00:06:12.59 --> 00:06:16.319
we are

142
00:06:13.11 --> 00:06:16.319
[Music]

143
00:06:16.81 --> 00:06:21.470
the point is that today Tesla is the

144
00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.479
great reference point in this new

145
00:06:21.47 --> 00:06:25.490
industry many investors understand this

146
00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.930
and therefore value the future of the

147
00:06:25.49 --> 00:06:28.639
company highly the company's own

148
00:06:26.93 --> 00:06:29.870
forecasts follow the same line and

149
00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.930
expect that production will increase

150
00:06:29.87 --> 00:06:35.270
from a hundred thousand cars in 2017 to

151
00:06:32.93 --> 00:06:39.530
five hundred thousand in 2020 and more

152
00:06:35.27 --> 00:06:41.240
than a million by 2022 it always seems

153
00:06:39.53 --> 00:06:43.310
like we're talking about the Apple of

154
00:06:41.24 --> 00:06:45.650
the automotive sector right well just

155
00:06:43.31 --> 00:06:50.620
wait a moment because not everything

156
00:06:45.65 --> 00:06:50.620
that surrounds Tesla is quite so great a

157
00:06:53.41 --> 00:07:00.260
crusher of money Tesla they have a

158
00:06:58.4 --> 00:07:03.470
problem a very serious problem indeed

159
00:07:00.26 --> 00:07:05.810
Tesla are a machine for burning money

160
00:07:03.47 --> 00:07:07.340
yes you heard me correctly today the

161
00:07:05.81 --> 00:07:10.070
business is not profitable um the

162
00:07:07.34 --> 00:07:11.900
company loses money every day but not

163
00:07:10.07 --> 00:07:13.669
only that it also has to make a lot of

164
00:07:11.9 --> 00:07:16.009
investment in order to compete for

165
00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:19.810
example its factories need pumping with

166
00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.810
loads and loads of money

167
00:07:20.95 --> 00:07:25.360
if we look at the money that comes in

168
00:07:23.41 --> 00:07:27.040
and out of the cash box at Tesla as we

169
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:28.900
already did with Amazon we can say that

170
00:07:27.04 --> 00:07:30.610
from 2010 when it went public the

171
00:07:28.9 --> 00:07:32.050
company hasn't swallowed absolutely

172
00:07:30.61 --> 00:07:34.420
everything that has entered it the money

173
00:07:32.05 --> 00:07:38.050
from the car sales as well as about 10

174
00:07:34.42 --> 00:07:41.620
billion dollars more and the truth is

175
00:07:38.05 --> 00:07:44.620
that 2017 is not exactly Tesla's best

176
00:07:41.62 --> 00:07:50.290
year in the first nine months of 2017 it

177
00:07:44.62 --> 00:07:51.940
swallowed about four billion dollars yes

178
00:07:50.29 --> 00:07:54.160
really four billion dollars in nine

179
00:07:51.94 --> 00:07:56.320
months and not only that but at the same

180
00:07:54.16 --> 00:07:58.300
time it's non-financial debt for example

181
00:07:56.32 --> 00:08:00.520
suppliers that have not been paid has

182
00:07:58.3 --> 00:08:03.160
absolutely skyrocketed for this reason

183
00:08:00.52 --> 00:08:06.540
lights are beginning to flash red at the

184
00:08:03.16 --> 00:08:06.540
company consider this graph

185
00:08:07.17 --> 00:08:10.480
[Music]

186
00:08:10.85 --> 00:08:15.960
yeah in the last few months Tesla has

187
00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:18.060
lost 16 million dollars every single day

188
00:08:15.96 --> 00:08:20.039
money of course but it's had to cover

189
00:08:18.06 --> 00:08:20.460
with debt but it doesn't stop there not

190
00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:22.349
at all

191
00:08:20.46 --> 00:08:25.050
Tesla is also having many problems with

192
00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:28.680
its latest model Tesla reveals it just

193
00:08:25.05 --> 00:08:29.940
made 260 Model 3 cars due to production

194
00:08:28.68 --> 00:08:31.800
bottlenecks

195
00:08:29.94 --> 00:08:33.630
it also has quality problems and has

196
00:08:31.8 --> 00:08:35.219
dismissed staff which by the way is a

197
00:08:33.63 --> 00:08:37.649
little bit weird when they seem to need

198
00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:41.200
to be making a lot more cars rather than

199
00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:41.770
less so do you want to see the car

200
00:08:41.2 --> 00:08:47.450
[Applause]

201
00:08:41.77 --> 00:08:47.450
[Music]

202
00:08:48.31 --> 00:08:51.710
and so now you might be thinking well

203
00:08:50.39 --> 00:08:53.540
surely there's got to be the worst of it

204
00:08:51.71 --> 00:08:55.550
right well just wait a minute because

205
00:08:53.54 --> 00:08:59.860
the worst of it is that the competition

206
00:08:55.55 --> 00:08:59.860
is moving really really quickly

207
00:09:01.89 --> 00:09:07.780
in 2016 the Renault Nissen group sold

208
00:09:05.14 --> 00:09:09.280
more electric cars than Tesla and pretty

209
00:09:07.78 --> 00:09:11.140
much all big companies are already

210
00:09:09.28 --> 00:09:13.210
working on electric vehicles and

211
00:09:11.14 --> 00:09:15.520
autonomous cars a business by the way

212
00:09:13.21 --> 00:09:17.380
which companies such as Apple Google and

213
00:09:15.52 --> 00:09:19.900
uber are also getting into and that's

214
00:09:17.38 --> 00:09:22.240
some pretty serious competition so yeah

215
00:09:19.9 --> 00:09:24.540
Tesla is not the only player at this

216
00:09:22.24 --> 00:09:24.540
game

217
00:09:28.57 --> 00:09:31.970
[Music]

218
00:09:30.11 --> 00:09:34.010
the difference is that almost all of its

219
00:09:31.97 --> 00:09:36.110
rivals actually earn money and have

220
00:09:34.01 --> 00:09:39.800
research budgets at least as big as

221
00:09:36.11 --> 00:09:41.510
those at Tesla Daimler steals Tesla's

222
00:09:39.8 --> 00:09:43.820
thunder with heavy-duty

223
00:09:41.51 --> 00:09:45.050
electric truck so at this point you

224
00:09:43.82 --> 00:09:46.730
might be thinking about what happens

225
00:09:45.05 --> 00:09:48.740
with Nokia and Blackberry

226
00:09:46.73 --> 00:09:50.840
when Apple stood out from all the major

227
00:09:48.74 --> 00:09:52.700
companies with the iPhone so now I ask

228
00:09:50.84 --> 00:09:58.910
you do you think we can compare Tesla

229
00:09:52.7 --> 00:10:00.680
with Apple well I do not believe that

230
00:09:58.91 --> 00:10:02.330
the answer is easy but I do believe

231
00:10:00.68 --> 00:10:04.310
there are at least a couple of

232
00:10:02.33 --> 00:10:06.920
differences that we do have to take into

233
00:10:04.31 --> 00:10:08.750
account first Apple was always worried

234
00:10:06.92 --> 00:10:10.460
about earning money with the iPhone and

235
00:10:08.75 --> 00:10:12.620
seconds their product was something

236
00:10:10.46 --> 00:10:14.330
really really disruptive so much so that

237
00:10:12.62 --> 00:10:16.430
even the competition predicted its

238
00:10:14.33 --> 00:10:20.540
failure consider what Steve Ballmer the

239
00:10:16.43 --> 00:10:23.120
then CEO of Microsoft said $500 I said

240
00:10:20.54 --> 00:10:25.040
that is the most expensive phone in the

241
00:10:23.12 --> 00:10:26.390
world and it doesn't appeal to business

242
00:10:25.04 --> 00:10:28.790
customers because it doesn't have a

243
00:10:26.39 --> 00:10:31.250
keyboard which makes it not a very good

244
00:10:28.79 --> 00:10:34.040
email machine right now we're selling

245
00:10:31.25 --> 00:10:36.320
millions and millions and millions of

246
00:10:34.04 --> 00:10:38.660
phones a year Apple is selling zero

247
00:10:36.32 --> 00:10:41.360
phones a year is six months let's see

248
00:10:38.66 --> 00:10:46.340
how the competition goes Steve Ballmer

249
00:10:41.36 --> 00:10:48.410
former CEO of Microsoft $500 I like our

250
00:10:46.34 --> 00:10:50.660
strategy I like it a lot as we have seen

251
00:10:48.41 --> 00:10:52.550
Tesla does not earn money or have any

252
00:10:50.66 --> 00:10:54.200
particularly surprising features however

253
00:10:52.55 --> 00:10:56.090
it has to be said that making your

254
00:10:54.2 --> 00:10:58.340
company and money has not been the most

255
00:10:56.09 --> 00:11:01.370
motivating element for its CEO the

256
00:10:58.34 --> 00:11:05.340
well-known Elon Musk

257
00:11:01.37 --> 00:11:05.340
[Music]

258
00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:12.199
Elon Musk the visionary a visionary a

259
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:14.389
genius out of his time these are many

260
00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:16.159
opinions about Elon Musk an entrepreneur

261
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:17.190
who has become a billionaire from his

262
00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:19.620
ventures

263
00:11:17.19 --> 00:11:21.940
[Music]

264
00:11:19.62 --> 00:11:23.770
and to be honest these are businesses

265
00:11:21.94 --> 00:11:25.990
that have never worried about money with

266
00:11:23.77 --> 00:11:28.090
the exception of PayPal Tesla I believe

267
00:11:25.99 --> 00:11:29.560
SpaceX anything which Elon Musk is

268
00:11:28.09 --> 00:11:31.450
involved with sounds like science

269
00:11:29.56 --> 00:11:33.400
fiction and seems to have an infinite

270
00:11:31.45 --> 00:11:35.830
budget if something is clear it is that

271
00:11:33.4 --> 00:11:39.150
with his ideas Elon Musk is influencing

272
00:11:35.83 --> 00:11:42.880
us in how we see and build our future

273
00:11:39.15 --> 00:11:42.880
[Music]

274
00:11:43.29 --> 00:11:49.089
but this does not mean that the future

275
00:11:45.88 --> 00:11:51.639
is already written Tesla has done very

276
00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:53.980
useful work by opening the market for

277
00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:56.380
electric cars and showing that people

278
00:11:53.98 --> 00:11:57.970
may like them another issue is whether

279
00:11:56.38 --> 00:12:00.040
it can earn a lot of money when it

280
00:11:57.97 --> 00:12:02.440
reaches its final goal I won't bet on

281
00:12:00.04 --> 00:12:05.470
Tesla as an investor I think it will be

282
00:12:02.44 --> 00:12:13.480
very difficult to survive Andres I end

283
00:12:05.47 --> 00:12:16.290
fund manager analyst Kobus am the

284
00:12:13.48 --> 00:12:16.290
opportunity

285
00:12:16.62 --> 00:12:21.180
so does everything we've seen mean that

286
00:12:18.6 --> 00:12:22.200
Tesla is a company doomed to failure no

287
00:12:21.18 --> 00:12:23.910
of course not

288
00:12:22.2 --> 00:12:25.680
saying such a thing certainly not our

289
00:12:23.91 --> 00:12:28.080
intention among other things because the

290
00:12:25.68 --> 00:12:30.510
future is by definition uncertain as

291
00:12:28.08 --> 00:12:32.580
because Tesla also has many competitive

292
00:12:30.51 --> 00:12:34.800
advantages for example today it has an

293
00:12:32.58 --> 00:12:36.150
obvious technological advantage it is a

294
00:12:34.8 --> 00:12:38.460
leader in the development and

295
00:12:36.15 --> 00:12:40.740
manufacturing of batteries which are the

296
00:12:38.46 --> 00:12:42.720
key to any electric car and very

297
00:12:40.74 --> 00:12:47.280
important for growth rates

298
00:12:42.72 --> 00:12:50.400
[Music]

299
00:12:47.28 --> 00:12:56.820
and then there is also China China China

300
00:12:50.4 --> 00:12:59.070
China do you know who the biggest market

301
00:12:56.82 --> 00:13:00.840
for electric cars is well you might have

302
00:12:59.07 --> 00:13:02.760
guessed it from that last comments it is

303
00:13:00.84 --> 00:13:04.680
indeed China in this country more

304
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:07.050
electric cars are sold each year than on

305
00:13:04.68 --> 00:13:08.850
the rest of the planet combined and its

306
00:13:07.05 --> 00:13:11.180
government has clearly opted for this

307
00:13:08.85 --> 00:13:11.180
technology

308
00:13:11.64 --> 00:13:15.309
[Music]

309
00:13:15.91 --> 00:13:19.840
well Tesla is now negotiating the

310
00:13:18.19 --> 00:13:21.850
installation of a big factory in

311
00:13:19.84 --> 00:13:23.680
Shanghai with rather preferential

312
00:13:21.85 --> 00:13:25.180
conditions and you know what it seems

313
00:13:23.68 --> 00:13:26.650
that negotiations with the Chinese

314
00:13:25.18 --> 00:13:28.780
governments are going in the right

315
00:13:26.65 --> 00:13:30.280
direction anyway only the future will

316
00:13:28.78 --> 00:13:32.020
let us know what happens but what is

317
00:13:30.28 --> 00:13:33.550
clear is that Tesla has been a turning

318
00:13:32.02 --> 00:13:35.920
point for the automotive industry but

319
00:13:33.55 --> 00:13:36.880
that it is also a firm facing many risks

320
00:13:35.92 --> 00:13:41.410
the last one

321
00:13:36.88 --> 00:13:42.640
for example comes from Washington it

322
00:13:41.41 --> 00:13:44.320
seems that the fiscal reform of the

323
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:46.210
Republican Party is going to finish

324
00:13:44.32 --> 00:13:48.010
public aid for the purchase of electric

325
00:13:46.21 --> 00:13:49.750
cars well we will see how that matter

326
00:13:48.01 --> 00:13:50.260
ends but when Hong Kong did something

327
00:13:49.75 --> 00:13:52.570
like that

328
00:13:50.26 --> 00:13:54.310
Tesla sales fell markedly anyway now

329
00:13:52.57 --> 00:13:56.260
it's your turn do you think Tesla will

330
00:13:54.31 --> 00:13:58.480
be successful and will become the great

331
00:13:56.26 --> 00:14:00.100
car company of the future well leave
