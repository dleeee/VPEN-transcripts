00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.519
I'm gonna start this episode with a

3
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.769
question and please don't treat him

4
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.389
please don't Google the answer what is

5
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.420
the country with the biggest share of

6
00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
female politicians inside its parliament

7
00:00:18.42 --> 00:00:22.050
you might be thinking right now Norway

8
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.910
Sweden maybe Great Britain well if

9
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:26.130
that's the case your thinking is wrong

10
00:00:23.91 --> 00:00:28.680
because the answer it's actually Rwanda

11
00:00:26.13 --> 00:00:29.380
one of the poorest places in sub-saharan

12
00:00:28.68 --> 00:00:31.520
Africa

13
00:00:29.38 --> 00:00:33.860
[Music]

14
00:00:31.52 --> 00:00:36.080
I'm sure many of you already know this

15
00:00:33.86 --> 00:00:38.390
country at least those of you who are as

16
00:00:36.08 --> 00:00:40.700
old as me because in the year 1994 the

17
00:00:38.39 --> 00:00:43.100
Rwandan genocide it appears on every

18
00:00:40.7 --> 00:00:45.500
news station around the world it was one

19
00:00:43.1 --> 00:00:47.930
of the biggest atrocities in mankind's

20
00:00:45.5 --> 00:00:49.580
history in just 100 days the Rwandan

21
00:00:47.93 --> 00:00:51.890
government brutally killed almost a

22
00:00:49.58 --> 00:00:54.620
million people this meant that every one

23
00:00:51.89 --> 00:00:56.960
in five Rwandan was murdered for decades

24
00:00:54.62 --> 00:00:59.150
Rwanda was the synonym for humanitarian

25
00:00:56.96 --> 00:01:01.489
catastrophe starvation and it was a

26
00:00:59.15 --> 00:01:04.009
memory of the darkest side of the human

27
00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.890
condition nonetheless 23 years later in

28
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.360
the year 2017 Rwanda is turning into

29
00:01:06.89 --> 00:01:13.280
something at much different complexions

30
00:01:11.36 --> 00:01:15.290
from Rwanda investing in one of the

31
00:01:13.28 --> 00:01:17.360
world's fastest growing economies yep

32
00:01:15.29 --> 00:01:19.970
you heard that right Rwanda is becoming

33
00:01:17.36 --> 00:01:21.800
a hot topic in the financial world a

34
00:01:19.97 --> 00:01:23.990
country that used to appear on

35
00:01:21.8 --> 00:01:26.180
humanitarian aid commercials now is

36
00:01:23.99 --> 00:01:28.040
starting to fill financial newspapers

37
00:01:26.18 --> 00:01:30.500
and it's presidents Paul Kagame has

38
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:32.270
become the new African rock star being

39
00:01:30.5 --> 00:01:34.550
received at prestigious places like

40
00:01:32.27 --> 00:01:36.530
Harvard or the Brookings Institution yes

41
00:01:34.55 --> 00:01:38.750
of course everyone does agree that his

42
00:01:36.53 --> 00:01:40.910
starless kind of Etherea turn winning

43
00:01:38.75 --> 00:01:43.039
elections with over 96% of the vote

44
00:01:40.91 --> 00:01:44.990
doesn't exactly sound democratic does it

45
00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.819
but I mean despite all of that who can

46
00:01:44.99 --> 00:01:48.319
judge a man that he's taking Rwanda out

47
00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.069
of poverty the figures speak for

48
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.810
themselves

49
00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.700
since Paul Kagame came into power

50
00:01:50.81 --> 00:01:54.140
Rwandans have tripled their income and

51
00:01:52.7 --> 00:01:56.060
the percentage of the population that

52
00:01:54.14 --> 00:01:58.810
lives in extreme poverty is reducing

53
00:01:56.06 --> 00:01:58.810
year after year

54
00:01:59.84 --> 00:02:05.280
so now the question is how did Rwanda

55
00:02:02.76 --> 00:02:07.320
end up like this or perhaps maybe this

56
00:02:05.28 --> 00:02:08.910
is too good to be true and is the some

57
00:02:07.32 --> 00:02:11.190
detail we're missing here

58
00:02:08.91 --> 00:02:13.350
today well we are going to answer those

59
00:02:11.19 --> 00:02:14.700
questions before we do as usual let's

60
00:02:13.35 --> 00:02:18.700
take a look back at the history and

61
00:02:14.7 --> 00:02:20.930
trust me this one is pretty intense

62
00:02:18.7 --> 00:02:23.820
[Music]

63
00:02:20.93 --> 00:02:27.330
prefabricated hatred remember this date

64
00:02:23.82 --> 00:02:29.040
April the 6th 1994 on this date the

65
00:02:27.33 --> 00:02:33.320
plane the Rwandan president was flying

66
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:33.320
in was hit by an anti-aircraft gun

67
00:02:35.48 --> 00:02:39.650
no one really knows who organized this

68
00:02:38.0 --> 00:02:41.510
attack but the Rwandan army whose

69
00:02:39.65 --> 00:02:44.420
soldiers belonged to the Hutu tribe

70
00:02:41.51 --> 00:02:46.549
blamed their rival the Tutsis Tutsis

71
00:02:44.42 --> 00:02:48.650
were a minority insider ones are living

72
00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.599
in an apartheid situation local media

73
00:02:48.65 --> 00:02:52.549
referred to them as cockroaches and many

74
00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.709
of them had already escaped to refugee

75
00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.970
camps in neighboring countries but no

76
00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.000
one could have predicted that the

77
00:02:55.97 --> 00:03:01.000
mounting prejudice would have unleashed

78
00:02:58.0 --> 00:03:01.000
carnage

79
00:03:35.49 --> 00:03:39.700
what messages like this were broadcast

80
00:03:37.84 --> 00:03:41.530
on the radio the Rwandan army was

81
00:03:39.7 --> 00:03:43.360
passing out clubs and machetes to

82
00:03:41.53 --> 00:03:45.250
civilians if any of those who to

83
00:03:43.36 --> 00:03:47.590
civilians showed mercy to his or her

84
00:03:45.25 --> 00:03:50.100
Tutsi neighbors he or she would risk

85
00:03:47.59 --> 00:03:52.870
being executed as a collaborator

86
00:03:50.1 --> 00:03:55.390
[Music]

87
00:03:52.87 --> 00:03:57.220
this explains why many Rwandan z' clubs

88
00:03:55.39 --> 00:03:59.590
that could see wives to death and why

89
00:03:57.22 --> 00:04:01.959
even some Catholic churches became human

90
00:03:59.59 --> 00:04:04.030
slaughterhouses in just 100 days nearly

91
00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.850
a million people died by their neighbors

92
00:04:04.03 --> 00:04:07.810
machetes

93
00:04:04.85 --> 00:04:09.850
[Music]

94
00:04:07.81 --> 00:04:11.890
and well now you might be wondering why

95
00:04:09.85 --> 00:04:13.870
did the Hutus hate the Tutsi so much

96
00:04:11.89 --> 00:04:16.060
were they really that different

97
00:04:13.87 --> 00:04:25.530
and while the answer as you expect is no

98
00:04:16.06 --> 00:04:28.300
[Music]

99
00:04:25.53 --> 00:04:29.919
you see many African countries have lots

100
00:04:28.3 --> 00:04:31.960
of different cultures and races living

101
00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.570
together South Africa for example has

102
00:04:31.96 --> 00:04:41.890
nine official languages Uganda has over

103
00:04:34.57 --> 00:04:43.660
15 nonetheless Rwandan territory was

104
00:04:41.89 --> 00:04:46.060
surprisingly homogeneous for centuries

105
00:04:43.66 --> 00:04:48.370
one single language one single culture

106
00:04:46.06 --> 00:04:50.560
the Hootie's the Tutsis and other tribes

107
00:04:48.37 --> 00:04:51.790
they lived in relative harmony but in

108
00:04:50.56 --> 00:04:53.830
the 20th century

109
00:04:51.79 --> 00:04:55.570
Belgium colonized this country one of

110
00:04:53.83 --> 00:04:57.280
the first policies made by the Belgian

111
00:04:55.57 --> 00:04:59.110
government was to force the locals to

112
00:04:57.28 --> 00:05:01.810
label themselves according to the tribe

113
00:04:59.11 --> 00:05:03.970
they belong to this way it would be

114
00:05:01.81 --> 00:05:08.889
easier for the colonizers to identify

115
00:05:03.97 --> 00:05:10.870
who was who and during the first years

116
00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.580
the Tutsis were the tribe in charge of

117
00:05:10.87 --> 00:05:14.680
government institutions created by the

118
00:05:12.58 --> 00:05:16.390
Belgians then one day those Tutsis

119
00:05:14.68 --> 00:05:17.860
started asking for independent and

120
00:05:16.39 --> 00:05:20.530
that's when Belgians started supporting

121
00:05:17.86 --> 00:05:22.390
the Hutus with racist propaganda this is

122
00:05:20.53 --> 00:05:25.150
how when Rubens became a sovereign state

123
00:05:22.39 --> 00:05:27.640
in 1962 Hutus and Tutsis had already

124
00:05:25.15 --> 00:05:29.979
become fierce enemies that hatred it was

125
00:05:27.64 --> 00:05:32.200
fabricated by the colonizers and many

126
00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.740
Tutsis had to flee to refugee camps in

127
00:05:32.2 --> 00:05:37.830
neighboring countries

128
00:05:33.74 --> 00:05:40.210
[Music]

129
00:05:37.83 --> 00:05:42.310
among them was the man that you see on

130
00:05:40.21 --> 00:05:42.790
the screen now Paul Kagame now remember

131
00:05:42.31 --> 00:05:44.350
his name

132
00:05:42.79 --> 00:05:46.720
because it will be the key figure in

133
00:05:44.35 --> 00:05:48.430
this story Paul Kagame he was raised on

134
00:05:46.72 --> 00:05:50.950
one of those aforementioned refugee

135
00:05:48.43 --> 00:05:53.140
camps this one it was situated in Uganda

136
00:05:50.95 --> 00:05:55.060
it was the beginning of the 1980s back

137
00:05:53.14 --> 00:05:57.460
then Uganda was in the middle of a civil

138
00:05:55.06 --> 00:05:59.230
war and Kagame along with other Rwandan

139
00:05:57.46 --> 00:06:06.370
refugees for to the Ugandan government

140
00:05:59.23 --> 00:06:09.280
and they won and this is how Kagame as a

141
00:06:06.37 --> 00:06:10.930
military legend was born in the 1990s he

142
00:06:09.28 --> 00:06:13.000
would lead other attacks against the

143
00:06:10.93 --> 00:06:16.660
Hutu led Rwandan government but the

144
00:06:13.0 --> 00:06:20.970
turning point was in 1994 100 days after

145
00:06:16.66 --> 00:06:20.970
that horrific massacre on April the 6th

146
00:06:21.23 --> 00:06:25.480
[Music]

147
00:06:22.92 --> 00:06:28.540
tegami was making his entrance in Kigali

148
00:06:25.48 --> 00:06:31.570
the Rwandan capital with 2,500 soldiers

149
00:06:28.54 --> 00:06:33.400
the genocide was over and Rwanda it had

150
00:06:31.57 --> 00:06:35.200
a new government this time it was a

151
00:06:33.4 --> 00:06:37.330
Tutsi led governments with Kagame is

152
00:06:35.2 --> 00:06:39.490
serving as the vice president but hold

153
00:06:37.33 --> 00:06:41.290
on trista seconds because the story it

154
00:06:39.49 --> 00:06:43.240
doesn't just end here because imagine

155
00:06:41.29 --> 00:06:44.950
the scenario for one he had to help lead

156
00:06:43.24 --> 00:06:46.570
a divided country where genocide

157
00:06:44.95 --> 00:06:48.280
survivors had to live next to the

158
00:06:46.57 --> 00:06:49.080
neighbors that had killed their friends

159
00:06:48.28 --> 00:06:51.570
and family

160
00:06:49.08 --> 00:06:54.250
[Music]

161
00:06:51.57 --> 00:06:56.350
and didn't help that Rwanda was one of

162
00:06:54.25 --> 00:06:58.750
the ten poorest countries on earth with

163
00:06:56.35 --> 00:07:00.460
few resources to export and on top of

164
00:06:58.75 --> 00:07:02.020
all of that this brand-new Tutsi

165
00:07:00.46 --> 00:07:04.360
government was not an example of

166
00:07:02.02 --> 00:07:06.490
transparency and respect for human

167
00:07:04.36 --> 00:07:08.380
rights as you can imagine many of the

168
00:07:06.49 --> 00:07:10.690
soldiers who had taken over Kigali they

169
00:07:08.38 --> 00:07:12.490
wanted revenge and well during the next

170
00:07:10.69 --> 00:07:15.220
year no one made an effort to stop the

171
00:07:12.49 --> 00:07:16.960
executions and the unfair trials if this

172
00:07:15.22 --> 00:07:18.310
wasn't enough many ministers trying to

173
00:07:16.96 --> 00:07:19.630
use their positions to fill their

174
00:07:18.31 --> 00:07:22.090
pockets with the little money that

175
00:07:19.63 --> 00:07:24.160
Rwanda hat corruption was certainly on

176
00:07:22.09 --> 00:07:25.900
the rise meanwhile Paul Kagame had the

177
00:07:24.16 --> 00:07:28.150
charisma the popular support and

178
00:07:25.9 --> 00:07:30.550
especially the political ambitions rise

179
00:07:28.15 --> 00:07:32.620
even higher and this is why in March of

180
00:07:30.55 --> 00:07:33.730
2000 that u2 president resigns and

181
00:07:32.62 --> 00:07:36.300
without an election

182
00:07:33.73 --> 00:07:39.470
well the inevitable happens

183
00:07:36.3 --> 00:07:42.060
[Music]

184
00:07:39.47 --> 00:07:44.069
regarding the eternal president in the

185
00:07:42.06 --> 00:07:46.020
year 2000 Paul Kagame became the new

186
00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:49.139
Rwandan president and he came to power

187
00:07:46.02 --> 00:07:51.389
with two clear goals the first one was

188
00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:53.190
to unify the Rwandan people after the

189
00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:55.410
genocide the second was to pull his

190
00:07:53.19 --> 00:07:58.050
country out of poverty so what did he do

191
00:07:55.41 --> 00:08:01.340
to achieve this latter goal well he

192
00:07:58.05 --> 00:08:01.340
traveled a lot

193
00:08:02.79 --> 00:08:07.180
Kagami created an advisory team that

194
00:08:05.44 --> 00:08:09.580
went to countries like China Thailand

195
00:08:07.18 --> 00:08:11.230
and Singapore so can you guess what

196
00:08:09.58 --> 00:08:13.180
those three places what do they have in

197
00:08:11.23 --> 00:08:15.340
common well the answer is that they were

198
00:08:13.18 --> 00:08:18.750
countries that used to be poor and back

199
00:08:15.34 --> 00:08:20.860
then they were emerging nations

200
00:08:18.75 --> 00:08:22.750
Kagami arranged meetings with

201
00:08:20.86 --> 00:08:24.700
politicians economists sent civil

202
00:08:22.75 --> 00:08:27.070
servants and from these meetings he

203
00:08:24.7 --> 00:08:29.080
wrote down scores of ideas in a notebook

204
00:08:27.07 --> 00:08:31.150
then he returned with the golden formula

205
00:08:29.08 --> 00:08:32.979
to build a wealthy country this notebook

206
00:08:31.15 --> 00:08:35.080
became the foundation for the brand-new

207
00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.180
Rwandan Constitution and more

208
00:08:35.08 --> 00:08:39.430
importantly a vision 2020 basically

209
00:08:37.18 --> 00:08:40.930
vision 2020 was a government development

210
00:08:39.43 --> 00:08:42.880
plan launched by Paul Kagame

211
00:08:40.93 --> 00:08:44.860
with the goal of transforming Rwanda

212
00:08:42.88 --> 00:08:48.880
into a middle-income country in just two

213
00:08:44.86 --> 00:08:51.070
decades modern peaceful country or

214
00:08:48.88 --> 00:08:52.240
extreme poverty no longer existed but

215
00:08:51.07 --> 00:08:54.460
wait just a minute because this isn't

216
00:08:52.24 --> 00:08:56.920
the normal buzzword filled speech of a

217
00:08:54.46 --> 00:09:00.250
politician Rwanda is vision 2020 it had

218
00:08:56.92 --> 00:09:02.260
44 clear and accountable goals for

219
00:09:00.25 --> 00:09:04.270
instance it said that by the year 2020

220
00:09:02.26 --> 00:09:06.070
one in every three Rwandans must have

221
00:09:04.27 --> 00:09:07.810
electricity at home to both the

222
00:09:06.07 --> 00:09:09.520
governments and private consultancy

223
00:09:07.81 --> 00:09:13.230
firms are analyzing and measuring the

224
00:09:09.52 --> 00:09:13.230
progress of all of these goals

225
00:09:16.09 --> 00:09:20.630
so let's take a look at an example one

226
00:09:18.77 --> 00:09:22.670
of those targets was to make rwanda a

227
00:09:20.63 --> 00:09:24.860
gender equality Haven and now the

228
00:09:22.67 --> 00:09:27.770
Rwandan Constitution requires that at

229
00:09:24.86 --> 00:09:34.370
least 50% of all government positions be

230
00:09:27.77 --> 00:09:36.050
held by women in fact at the time of

231
00:09:34.37 --> 00:09:38.180
making this video the Rwandan parliament

232
00:09:36.05 --> 00:09:39.380
has the biggest chair of female MPs in

233
00:09:38.18 --> 00:09:41.540
the entire world

234
00:09:39.38 --> 00:09:43.340
and the wage gap between men and women

235
00:09:41.54 --> 00:09:46.070
is lower than in countries as

236
00:09:43.34 --> 00:09:48.560
progressive as Denmark today there is a

237
00:09:46.07 --> 00:09:53.810
brand new generation of female Rwandan

238
00:09:48.56 --> 00:09:55.700
entrepreneurs leading a country and

239
00:09:53.81 --> 00:09:57.200
what's more Rwanda is investing the

240
00:09:55.7 --> 00:09:59.390
small amounts of money they collect in

241
00:09:57.2 --> 00:10:01.460
taxes pretty wisely in a country where

242
00:09:59.39 --> 00:10:03.470
80% of its population used to live off

243
00:10:01.46 --> 00:10:05.780
subsistence farming the government has

244
00:10:03.47 --> 00:10:08.090
built power generators and roads that

245
00:10:05.78 --> 00:10:10.070
increase agricultural productivity now

246
00:10:08.09 --> 00:10:11.150
Rwandan farmers are beginning to export

247
00:10:10.07 --> 00:10:14.710
food to their neighbours

248
00:10:11.15 --> 00:10:14.710
[Music]

249
00:10:15.37 --> 00:10:20.830
all of this explains why 23 years after

250
00:10:18.16 --> 00:10:23.830
the genocide Rwanda GDP is growing at an

251
00:10:20.83 --> 00:10:25.810
average rate of 8 percent a year this is

252
00:10:23.83 --> 00:10:28.600
similar to emerging economies like China

253
00:10:25.81 --> 00:10:31.029
or Vietnam on the same streets where in

254
00:10:28.6 --> 00:10:31.420
1994 people were clubbing each other to

255
00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:33.370
death

256
00:10:31.42 --> 00:10:35.290
startups like Rwanda motorcycle company

257
00:10:33.37 --> 00:10:37.960
are being born the motorcycle factor is

258
00:10:35.29 --> 00:10:39.160
created this year in 2017 with American

259
00:10:37.96 --> 00:10:40.600
investment if you want to start a

260
00:10:39.16 --> 00:10:42.160
company in neighboring countries

261
00:10:40.6 --> 00:10:43.839
you will need weeks or even months to

262
00:10:42.16 --> 00:10:45.460
deal with all the paperwork in Rwanda

263
00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:47.920
you're done with all that in just two

264
00:10:45.46 --> 00:10:50.620
days and of course this has attracted a

265
00:10:47.92 --> 00:10:52.870
lot of foreign investors especially from

266
00:10:50.62 --> 00:10:54.640
China and America and so now you might

267
00:10:52.87 --> 00:10:57.339
be wondering how did they end up here

268
00:10:54.64 --> 00:10:59.470
what's Paul Kagame secret well divvy up

269
00:10:57.339 --> 00:11:04.690
the answer it has a light side but it

270
00:10:59.47 --> 00:11:06.610
also has a dark side tolerance at

271
00:11:04.69 --> 00:11:08.410
gunpoint everyone believes it Rwanda

272
00:11:06.61 --> 00:11:10.480
works streets are safe and tolerance

273
00:11:08.41 --> 00:11:16.570
between Hutus and Tutsis is imposed by

274
00:11:10.48 --> 00:11:18.580
law the ones in Constitution itself

275
00:11:16.57 --> 00:11:20.920
forbids the use of the words Tutsi and

276
00:11:18.58 --> 00:11:22.779
hooting to refer to a person according

277
00:11:20.92 --> 00:11:24.940
to the government all citizens are

278
00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:26.950
Rwandan and no one should care about

279
00:11:24.94 --> 00:11:28.600
their tribe of origin either the media

280
00:11:26.95 --> 00:11:31.180
nor institutions are allowed to say

281
00:11:28.6 --> 00:11:34.510
anything that could spark hatred or open

282
00:11:31.18 --> 00:11:36.730
past scarce and well in fact they can't

283
00:11:34.51 --> 00:11:38.410
even criticize the government both the

284
00:11:36.73 --> 00:11:40.480
police and the military they are present

285
00:11:38.41 --> 00:11:43.150
all over the country to make sure that

286
00:11:40.48 --> 00:11:44.770
everyone follows these laws yeah it is

287
00:11:43.15 --> 00:11:46.930
true Paul Kagame is a popular president

288
00:11:44.77 --> 00:11:48.430
indeed he has his own YouTube channel

289
00:11:46.93 --> 00:11:51.220
and a Twitter and Facebook account that

290
00:11:48.43 --> 00:11:52.839
he uses almost daily but no one else has

291
00:11:51.22 --> 00:11:55.500
the freedom to express their ideas

292
00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:56.990
freely

and while the same goes for other

295
00:11:58.64 --> 00:12:02.330
political parties we're talking about a

296
00:12:00.59 --> 00:12:04.250
president who's been in power for 17

297
00:12:02.33 --> 00:12:07.610
years and he wins elections with

298
00:12:04.25 --> 00:12:09.680
outcomes higher than 95% of the vote as

299
00:12:07.61 --> 00:12:12.110
you can imagine this is not exactly

300
00:12:09.68 --> 00:12:14.420
Democratic one of his opponents Frank a

301
00:12:12.11 --> 00:12:16.790
bonanza of the only permitted opposition

303
00:12:16.79 --> 00:12:20.990
attempted to run for the 2010

304
00:12:18.59 --> 00:12:23.450
presidential election but his party was

305
00:12:20.99 --> 00:12:25.280
unable to register for the vote in other

306
00:12:23.45 --> 00:12:26.900
words the Rwandan model is based on

three pillars ease of investing and

308

doing business infrastructure

309

developments and at the top an

310
00:12:29.9 --> 00:12:34.520
authoritarian government that guarantees

safety and tolerance at the expense of

well now we want to know what your

315
00:12:40.21 --> 00:12:43.600
opinion is do you think that this lack

316
00:12:41.65 --> 00:12:45.520
of democracy is legitimate if the

317
00:12:43.6 --> 00:12:47.200
country can step out of poverty or

318
00:12:45.52 --> 00:12:48.610
perhaps Aranda would be better off if

319
00:12:47.2 --> 00:12:50.860
they structured the country in a more

320

democratic and Western model well please
