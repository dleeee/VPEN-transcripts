3
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:10.230
just before you get started I'd like to

4
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.820
give a quick plug for a new channel that

5
00:00:10.23 --> 00:00:14.040
I've started it's called biographic

6
00:00:11.82 --> 00:00:16.199
swear we look at biographies of famous

7
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:17.699
people from history as well as the

8
00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.140
present-day it's not all politics

9
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.119
although we have done some politics

10
00:00:19.14 --> 00:00:22.500
we've looked at Vladimir Putin as well

11
00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.689
as Arnold Schwarzenegger I know he

12
00:00:22.5 --> 00:00:26.460
definitely covers both fields but please

13
00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.960
do go check it out there is a link in

14
00:00:26.46 --> 00:00:29.400
the description below all right so you

15
00:00:27.96 --> 00:00:31.380
probably know Peter Thiel I build

16
00:00:29.4 --> 00:00:33.000
companies and I support people who are

17
00:00:31.38 --> 00:00:34.890
building new things he was one of the

18
00:00:33.0 --> 00:00:36.420
founders of PayPal the first investor of

19
00:00:34.89 --> 00:00:38.610
Facebook and he's one of the most

20
00:00:36.42 --> 00:00:40.890
important technology and venture capital

21
00:00:38.61 --> 00:00:42.989
gurus in the world he's obviously a

22
00:00:40.89 --> 00:00:45.420
multi billionaire and is also a bit of a

23
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.520
peculiar guy for instance he financed

24
00:00:45.42 --> 00:00:49.170
projects like the see standing Institute

25
00:00:47.52 --> 00:00:51.120
an organization aimed at being a

26
00:00:49.17 --> 00:00:53.160
politically autonomous floating city and

27
00:00:51.12 --> 00:00:55.469
he's also funded anti-aging research by

28
00:00:53.16 --> 00:00:57.059
using the blood of young people Peter

29
00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.129
Thiel is also known for being the

30
00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
biggest supporter of Donald Trump in

31
00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.030
Silicon Valley although in some

32
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:06.510
conversations with journalists recently

33
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:08.189
he's already shown some concerns and I

34
00:01:06.51 --> 00:01:10.260
mean what the hell all of us have the

35
00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.020
right to be wrong sometimes the thing is

36
00:01:10.26 --> 00:01:14.369
that in 2011 Peter Thiel was granted New

37
00:01:13.02 --> 00:01:17.460
Zealand citizenship and on his

38
00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.439
application he said this I'm happy to

39
00:01:17.46 --> 00:01:21.360
say categorically that I've found no

40
00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.189
other country that aligns more with my

41
00:01:21.36 --> 00:01:24.299
view of the future than New Zealand the

42
00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.009
truth is that this is probably no

43
00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.600
surprise to regular viewers official

44
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.579
politic we've already said in two other

45
00:01:27.6 --> 00:01:31.140
videos how much we love this country and

46
00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.340
not just for its beauty although New

47
00:01:31.14 --> 00:01:33.869
Zealand is one of the most beautiful

48
00:01:32.34 --> 00:01:35.820
countries in the world they're also an

49
00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.290
example to be followed take a look at

50
00:01:35.82 --> 00:01:38.520
these statements of former Prime

51
00:01:37.29 --> 00:01:41.060
Minister Bill English about his

52
00:01:38.52 --> 00:01:41.060
predecessor

53
00:01:41.3 --> 00:01:44.790
occasionally John Key would come home

54
00:01:43.26 --> 00:01:46.290
and complain that he was the only one

55
00:01:44.79 --> 00:01:47.970
who didn't have a jet and how his

56
00:01:46.29 --> 00:01:50.490
colleagues were horrified to find that

57
00:01:47.97 --> 00:01:52.350
he as a world leader had to travel on

58
00:01:50.49 --> 00:01:53.909
commercial aircraft but I assured him

59
00:01:52.35 --> 00:01:55.470
that it was character building and kept

60
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.200
him in touch with normal people bill

61
00:01:55.47 --> 00:01:59.490
English no New Zealand doesn't have an

62
00:01:58.2 --> 00:02:01.259
Air Force one of their own

63
00:01:59.49 --> 00:02:03.119
but it is one of the easiest countries

64
00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.380
to do business in and as we've already

65
00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.020
seen it's one of the most prosperous

66
00:02:04.38 --> 00:02:09.729
least corrupt and safest countries on

67
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:15.989
the planet

68
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:18.099
[Music]

69
00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.079
unless add to that their first-rate

70
00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.430
public services their ranking is one of

71
00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.500
the countries with the highest standards

72
00:02:21.43 --> 00:02:25.629
of living and as well as having one of

73
00:02:23.5 --> 00:02:26.590
the lowest employment rates just take a

74
00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.689
look at this chart

75
00:02:26.59 --> 00:02:29.689
[Music]

76
00:02:32.8 --> 00:02:45.050
however things they weren't always like

77
00:02:35.66 --> 00:02:47.450
this the Sun didn't always rise there's

78
00:02:45.05 --> 00:02:49.220
no doubt that New Zealand is a top-rate

79
00:02:47.45 --> 00:02:51.739
country but things weren't always like

80
00:02:49.22 --> 00:02:53.810
that definitely not not at all in fact

81
00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.819
what we are going to see now is a real

82
00:02:53.81 --> 00:02:58.069
story the story of a country that was

83
00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.780
determined to learn from its mistakes to

84
00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.540
transform everything that didn't work

85
00:02:59.78 --> 00:03:03.910
and by doing so become an international

86
00:03:02.54 --> 00:03:06.040
role model

87
00:03:03.91 --> 00:03:09.040
[Music]

88
00:03:06.04 --> 00:03:11.319
and well this is definitely not the norm

89
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:13.840
placing people first before any kind of

90
00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.849
ideology and electoral interests it's

91
00:03:13.84 --> 00:03:19.140
not so common at least not in most

92
00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.730
countries but let's see what happened

93
00:03:19.14 --> 00:03:22.989
[Music]

94
00:03:20.73 --> 00:03:25.060
well the first thing we have to say is

95
00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.980
that New Zealand was always a relatively

96
00:03:25.06 --> 00:03:28.840
wealthy country in fact by the late

97
00:03:26.98 --> 00:03:31.349
1950s this country had the third highest

98
00:03:28.84 --> 00:03:33.790
per capita income in the world which is

99
00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.069
certainly not bad right

100
00:03:33.79 --> 00:03:38.470
however just wait a moment because

101
00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.329
that's the moment when things started to

102
00:03:38.47 --> 00:03:42.700
get a bit worse I had enough in fact

103
00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.190
that by 1984 the per capita income was

104
00:03:42.7 --> 00:03:46.329
similar to that of Portugal or Turkey so

105
00:03:45.19 --> 00:03:48.370
well now you're probably wondering what

106
00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.470
what an F happens for New Zealand's to

107
00:03:48.37 --> 00:03:52.060
drop so far well it could be said that

108
00:03:50.47 --> 00:03:54.129
the government they went a bit too far

109
00:03:52.06 --> 00:03:55.750
by that time the government of New

110
00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.519
Zealand had meddled with the economy to

111
00:03:55.75 --> 00:04:00.020
such an extent that it's hard to even

112
00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.149
imagine what it was like

113
00:04:00.02 --> 00:04:04.149
[Music]

114
00:04:04.66 --> 00:04:09.820
there were many many taxes most of them

115
00:04:07.66 --> 00:04:11.710
incredibly complex and most of them

116
00:04:09.82 --> 00:04:13.720
really really high just so you can get

117
00:04:11.71 --> 00:04:16.870
an idea of that the highest income tax

118
00:04:13.72 --> 00:04:19.810
rate was almost 70% and the lowest was

119
00:04:16.87 --> 00:04:21.910
still 40% and companies they didn't get

120
00:04:19.81 --> 00:04:24.460
any better treatments the profit tax was

121
00:04:21.91 --> 00:04:26.380
48 percent which is twice as much as the

122
00:04:24.46 --> 00:04:28.090
world's average nowadays and on top of

123
00:04:26.38 --> 00:04:30.010
all of that there were tons of

124
00:04:28.09 --> 00:04:32.410
regulations there were price controls

125
00:04:30.01 --> 00:04:34.360
noise any product currency controls and

126
00:04:32.41 --> 00:04:36.670
that's just scratching the surface as an

127
00:04:34.36 --> 00:04:38.440
example any import required the approval

128
00:04:36.67 --> 00:04:40.480
of the administration and it was really

129
00:04:38.44 --> 00:04:42.670
hard for New Zealanders to invest their

130
00:04:40.48 --> 00:04:44.500
money outside of the country we have

131
00:04:42.67 --> 00:04:46.210
foreign exchange controls that meant I

132
00:04:44.5 --> 00:04:47.830
couldn't buy a subscription to The

133
00:04:46.21 --> 00:04:49.660
Economist magazine without the

134
00:04:47.83 --> 00:04:52.540
permission of the Minister of Finance

135
00:04:49.66 --> 00:04:54.010
Maurice P McTigue former minister of the

136
00:04:52.54 --> 00:04:55.570
government of New Zealand look the

137
00:04:54.01 --> 00:04:57.670
controls and regulations they didn't

138
00:04:55.57 --> 00:05:00.370
just establish minimum wages they also

139
00:04:57.67 --> 00:05:02.200
set caps for the maximum yep you heard

140
00:05:00.37 --> 00:05:04.120
that absolutely right let's say that a

141
00:05:02.2 --> 00:05:06.220
business owner wanted to pay a bonus to

142
00:05:04.12 --> 00:05:08.700
his workers well that wasn't an easy

143
00:05:06.22 --> 00:05:08.700
task

144
00:05:08.79 --> 00:05:11.970
[Music]

145
00:05:12.5 --> 00:05:16.340
and as you can imagine the state owns

146
00:05:14.51 --> 00:05:18.080
and controlled almost every large

147
00:05:16.34 --> 00:05:20.060
national company media Airlines

148
00:05:18.08 --> 00:05:22.250
insurance companies banks even hotels

149
00:05:20.06 --> 00:05:24.770
yet though government was really

150
00:05:22.25 --> 00:05:26.600
managing hotels not joking here so in

151
00:05:24.77 --> 00:05:29.210
other words the early 1980s New Zealand

152
00:05:26.6 --> 00:05:31.520
was the very example of extreme statism

153
00:05:29.21 --> 00:05:33.260
in one way or another almost everything

154
00:05:31.52 --> 00:05:35.240
was controlled by bureaucrats and

155
00:05:33.26 --> 00:05:37.340
politicians and so well what were the

156
00:05:35.24 --> 00:05:45.410
consequences of all this they weren't

157
00:05:37.34 --> 00:05:46.880
exactly positive after 23 years of

158
00:05:45.41 --> 00:05:49.610
deficit in the government's balanced

159
00:05:46.88 --> 00:05:51.620
public debt had absolutely skyrocketed

who was to figure unemployment private

161
00:05:51.62 --> 00:05:54.440
investors were pulling out of the

country and the Kiwi youth while they

163
00:05:54.44 --> 00:05:58.550
were fleeing in huge numbers by that

164
00:05:56.63 --> 00:06:00.500
time doing business in New Zealand it

165
00:05:58.55 --> 00:06:02.150
was an enormous ly complicated process

166
00:06:00.5 --> 00:06:03.830
and to be honest it was only attempted

167
00:06:02.15 --> 00:06:07.130
by the bravest however everything

168
00:06:03.83 --> 00:06:08.910
started to change in 1984 when elections

169
00:06:07.13 --> 00:06:16.639
took place

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.919
in 1984 in the midst of a tough crisis

173
00:06:23.34 --> 00:06:27.840
elections were celebrated the winner was

174
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.710
David Longley of the center-left party

175
00:06:27.84 --> 00:06:33.900
this nation is at risk

176
00:06:30.71 --> 00:06:35.550
that is how basic it is the new

177
00:06:33.9 --> 00:06:37.979
governments they had a purpose to

178
00:06:35.55 --> 00:06:39.659
overcome the crisis and to change the

179
00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.490
national model there to replace

180
00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.500
everything that didn't work and make

181
00:06:41.49 --> 00:06:46.349
sure they did it without leaving anybody

182
00:06:43.5 --> 00:06:48.090
behind while at the same time granting

183
00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.430
the opportunities for others to move

184
00:06:48.09 --> 00:06:51.629
forward so even though David Longley was

185
00:06:50.43 --> 00:06:53.370
the Prime Minister the leader of this

186
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:55.800
whole process was the Minister of

187
00:06:53.37 --> 00:06:58.050
Finance and that was Sir Roger Douglas

188
00:06:55.8 --> 00:06:59.909
in fact the process is named after him

189
00:06:58.05 --> 00:07:01.439
it's known as Roger na mcc's

190
00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.379
we went probably from being the most

191
00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:07.590
regulated in the developed world to the

192
00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:09.240
least Reagan regulator we actually

193
00:07:07.59 --> 00:07:11.039
discussed this in a previous video where

194
00:07:09.24 --> 00:07:12.479
we talked about the agricultural reforms

195
00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.460
that have been so successful in New

196
00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.860
Zealand to Roger Douglas started an

197
00:07:14.46 --> 00:07:18.900
ambitious reform program known as Roger

198
00:07:16.86 --> 00:07:20.909
Nam ik's in this program in many areas

199
00:07:18.9 --> 00:07:22.860
of the economy were liberalized and this

200
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.930
included the primary sector and these

201
00:07:22.86 --> 00:07:27.210
changes they took place almost overnight

202
00:07:24.93 --> 00:07:31.349
price controls were eliminated and most

203
00:07:27.21 --> 00:07:32.699
farming subsidies were removed but Roger

204
00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.800
nah makes it wasn't just about

205
00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:37.139
agriculture the plan affected almost

206
00:07:34.8 --> 00:07:39.060
every aspect of the state and created a

207
00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.949
new political culture in fact by the

208
00:07:39.06 --> 00:07:42.810
time the rights international party won

209
00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:44.759
the elections in 1990 and took power

210
00:07:42.81 --> 00:07:46.469
again everything had changed and the new

211
00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.240
government followed the Labour process

212
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:50.250
raw genomics it was the political

213
00:07:48.24 --> 00:07:52.589
philosophy that radically changed the

214
00:07:50.25 --> 00:07:55.380
country between the year 1984 and the

215
00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:58.779
beginnings of the 21st century

216
00:07:55.38 --> 00:07:58.779
[Music]

217
00:08:03.58 --> 00:08:08.080
the first thing that the government did

218
00:08:05.229 --> 00:08:10.990
was declare a war on bureaucracy they

219
00:08:08.08 --> 00:08:13.060
did it in three ways first they did a

220
00:08:10.99 --> 00:08:15.009
thorough analysis of every governmental

221
00:08:13.06 --> 00:08:16.780
department if what they did was not

222
00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:18.639
essential or could be better done by the

223
00:08:16.78 --> 00:08:20.470
markers well that was the end of it

224
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:22.810
following the same pattern they started

225
00:08:20.47 --> 00:08:24.220
an ambitious plan of privatization I

226
00:08:22.81 --> 00:08:26.650
mean think about it what was the state

227
00:08:24.22 --> 00:08:29.050
doing wasting time managing hotels

228
00:08:26.65 --> 00:08:30.940
Airlines or telecommunications thanks to

229
00:08:29.05 --> 00:08:33.430
competition the market could do a much

230
00:08:30.94 --> 00:08:35.800
better job and with less cost and more

231
00:08:33.43 --> 00:08:38.140
innovation I come at it from an angle of

232
00:08:35.8 --> 00:08:41.500
what's good for the consumer that

233
00:08:38.14 --> 00:08:43.240
provider I don't care fundamentally who

234
00:08:41.5 --> 00:08:45.010
the provider it might be it might be a

235
00:08:43.24 --> 00:08:47.260
public institution could be a private

236
00:08:45.01 --> 00:08:50.320
institution so long as it serves the

237
00:08:47.26 --> 00:08:53.020
consumer or the taxpayer that's where I

238
00:08:50.32 --> 00:08:54.760
come from seconds of the 35 remaining

239
00:08:53.02 --> 00:08:56.920
public agencies the government made

240
00:08:54.76 --> 00:08:58.450
management work under market conditions

241
00:08:56.92 --> 00:09:00.490
this was the case for air traffic

242
00:08:58.45 --> 00:09:02.860
controllers for instance and the results

243
00:09:00.49 --> 00:09:04.660
they were totally terrific not only did

244
00:09:02.86 --> 00:09:06.220
the services of these public agencies

245
00:09:04.66 --> 00:09:08.050
improve they went from costing the

246
00:09:06.22 --> 00:09:10.600
government a billion dollars every year

247
00:09:08.05 --> 00:09:12.579
to generating with taxes and profits

248
00:09:10.6 --> 00:09:14.230
more than a billion dollars this is

249
00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:16.660
money that could then be put into things

250
00:09:14.23 --> 00:09:18.520
like education health care and culture

251
00:09:16.66 --> 00:09:20.500
but that wasn't the end of it since

252
00:09:18.52 --> 00:09:22.360
regulations and laws were numerous and

253
00:09:20.5 --> 00:09:24.430
complexed the government decided to work

254
00:09:22.36 --> 00:09:26.500
towards an important goal and that was

255
00:09:24.43 --> 00:09:28.329
the simplification and elimination of

256
00:09:26.5 --> 00:09:30.910
any laws that they deemed unnecessary

257
00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:32.920
and so what was the result of all of

258
00:09:30.91 --> 00:09:33.970
these changes when we started this

259
00:09:32.92 --> 00:09:34.630
process with the Department of

260
00:09:33.97 --> 00:09:37.360
Transportation

261
00:09:34.63 --> 00:09:39.190
it had 5,600 employees when we finished

262
00:09:37.36 --> 00:09:41.110
it had 53 when we started with the

263
00:09:39.19 --> 00:09:44.140
Forest Service it had 17,000 employees

264
00:09:41.11 --> 00:09:46.390
when we finished it had 17 Maurice P

265
00:09:44.14 --> 00:09:48.790
McTigue and unemployment's it didn't

266
00:09:46.39 --> 00:09:50.470
increase it was reduced so there's this

267
00:09:48.79 --> 00:09:53.079
very illustrative story and it actually

268
00:09:50.47 --> 00:09:54.430
involves deer as in the animals so when

269
00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:56.320
the British arrived in New Zealand the

270
00:09:54.43 --> 00:09:58.180
country didn't have any large animal so

271
00:09:56.32 --> 00:10:00.310
the wealthy families they imported deer

272
00:09:58.18 --> 00:10:02.440
for hunting and well can you guess what

273
00:10:00.31 --> 00:10:05.140
happens these deers they spread rapidly

274
00:10:02.44 --> 00:10:07.600
forming massive herds that cost critical

275
00:10:05.14 --> 00:10:10.300
ecological damage by over grazing for

276
00:10:07.6 --> 00:10:12.040
120 years the state had spent a lot of

277
00:10:10.3 --> 00:10:16.350
money trying to fight this plague in

278
00:10:12.04 --> 00:10:16.350
order to preserve the local ecosystem

279
00:10:17.23 --> 00:10:22.330
[Music]

280
00:10:22.75 --> 00:10:26.829
well one day they came up with a new

281
00:10:24.91 --> 00:10:28.990
idea why couldn't they let farmers hunt

282
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:30.819
and raise the deer and well that's

283
00:10:28.99 --> 00:10:32.620
exactly what they did not only did this

284
00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:34.930
put an end to the plague New Zealand

285
00:10:32.62 --> 00:10:37.149
today is the world's largest supplier of

286
00:10:34.93 --> 00:10:39.040
deer meat and all of this it really does

287
00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:40.689
make sense and is also interesting to

288
00:10:39.04 --> 00:10:43.589
see what happened to taxes which were

289
00:10:40.689 --> 00:10:43.589
simplified and reduced

290
00:10:46.68 --> 00:10:52.970
many were surprised by the results tax

291
00:10:49.14 --> 00:10:58.410
collection actually increased by 20%

292
00:10:52.97 --> 00:11:01.530
[Music]

293
00:10:58.41 --> 00:11:01.530
[Applause]

294
00:11:01.68 --> 00:11:06.450
a further subsidization it was cast not

295
00:11:04.35 --> 00:11:08.580
only in agriculture but also in industry

296
00:11:06.45 --> 00:11:10.500
sectors but there was much more than

297
00:11:08.58 --> 00:11:12.540
just economic reform here the reforms

298
00:11:10.5 --> 00:11:14.370
reached the public services and take a

299
00:11:12.54 --> 00:11:16.110
look at what happens with education for

300
00:11:14.37 --> 00:11:17.580
instance the education budget of New

301
00:11:16.11 --> 00:11:19.230
Zealand it hadn't stopped growing for

302
00:11:17.58 --> 00:11:21.209
years but the results they were just

303
00:11:19.23 --> 00:11:22.920
getting worse and worse so the question

304
00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:24.510
was well a Kiwi students getting more

305
00:11:22.92 --> 00:11:26.670
stupid and that didn't really seem

306
00:11:24.51 --> 00:11:28.140
likely so when the government analyzed

307
00:11:26.67 --> 00:11:29.850
the causes they realized that an

308
00:11:28.14 --> 00:11:32.160
important share of the budget was not

309
00:11:29.85 --> 00:11:34.110
actually being spent on education but on

310
00:11:32.16 --> 00:11:36.750
administration these were quality

311
00:11:34.11 --> 00:11:39.089
evaluation agencies rating firms dossier

312
00:11:36.75 --> 00:11:40.740
agencies and so on so what did the

313
00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:42.899
government decide to do well they simply

314
00:11:40.74 --> 00:11:45.209
removed it all and they gave the schools

315
00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:47.190
control with a management board chosen

316
00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:49.400
by the parents

317
00:11:47.19 --> 00:11:51.770
[Music]

318
00:11:49.4 --> 00:11:53.450
also they allow parents to shoe schools

319
00:11:51.77 --> 00:11:55.220
freely private or public and the

320
00:11:53.45 --> 00:11:56.360
government would pay for it and well

321
00:11:55.22 --> 00:11:58.580
what we can tell you now is that

322
00:11:56.36 --> 00:12:01.430
education results improved significantly

323
00:11:58.58 --> 00:12:02.640
and well the same thing it happens with

324
00:12:01.43 --> 00:12:04.900
everything else

325
00:12:02.64 --> 00:12:07.370
[Music]

326
00:12:04.9 --> 00:12:08.930
New Zealand today it's a prosperous

327
00:12:07.37 --> 00:12:11.300
country with a very high standard of

328
00:12:08.93 --> 00:12:13.730
living and use public services education

329
00:12:11.3 --> 00:12:15.380
health and culture are among the best in

330
00:12:13.73 --> 00:12:17.330
the world so that leaves us thinking

331
00:12:15.38 --> 00:12:19.100
that New Zealand it's an amazing example

332
00:12:17.33 --> 00:12:20.839
for countries in Latin America or some

333
00:12:19.1 --> 00:12:23.330
European countries like Spain Italy

334
00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:25.070
Greece and Portugal well if anything is

335
00:12:23.33 --> 00:12:27.230
for certain it's that the land of Kiwis

336
00:12:25.07 --> 00:12:28.730
is a great country and now it's your

337
00:12:27.23 --> 00:12:30.800
turn do you think that New Zealand makes

338
00:12:28.73 --> 00:12:32.300
a good model to be followed well please

339
00:12:30.8 --> 00:12:33.500
do leave your answer in the comments

340
00:12:32.3 --> 00:12:35.660
below we'd love to hear from you and

341
00:12:33.5 --> 00:12:37.279
