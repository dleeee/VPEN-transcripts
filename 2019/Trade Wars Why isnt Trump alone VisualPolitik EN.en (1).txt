00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,560
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,059
if you thought the trade war with China

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,070
was just an obsession of Donald Trump's

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,210
you'd better think again

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,160
at the moments of making this video most

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,660
of the Democratic candidates for the

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,510
2020 elections have a very similar tone

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,869
against China check this out with Warren

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,449
could be quote even tougher than Trump

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,040
on China says analyst Joe Biden flips on

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,070
China threat now says it's serious of

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,170
course all of them criticized Trump's

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,940
approach and suggests different

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,280
strategies but everyone seems to agree

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,800
on the basics China is no longer a

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,860
partner but a threat instead so yes my

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
dear viewers the trade war is not a

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,850
short story but a political saga if we

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,010
have a new Star Wars trilogy in cinemas

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,350
the media is now talking about the trade

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,300
rules just in case you don't know what

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,129
the trade war is here's a small recap

23
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,260
basically everything started when Trump

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,660
imposed tariffs on Chinese goods such as

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,790
steel right after that China replied

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,280
with tariffs on American goods including

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,100
soy

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,960
the confrontation escalated into more

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,090
and more tariffs for thousands of goods

30
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,830
and products and in Albany of you might

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,750
be thinking right now if you don't live

32
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,270
in China or in the United States well or

33
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,800
why should you care about any of this

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,990
well the International Monetary Fund's

35
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:34,490
has the answer IMF says trade war cuts

36
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,920
global growth to lowest since financial

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,440
crisis a decade ago yes you heard that

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,110
right this trade war might lead to a

39
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,720
global recession well this affects

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,790
nearly everybody so the question you

41
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,910
might have now is why is Trump so keen

42
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,860
on destroying the world's economy of

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,180
course according to many media outlets

44
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,880
Trump is the bad guy in this story if

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,190
this were star wars we would be talking

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,280
about emperor trumpety but the truth is

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,320
whether we like it or not there is some

48
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,540
reasoning behind Trump's strategy we

49
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,100
might disagree with it but we must

50
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,649
understand it because no matter who wins

51
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,590
the 2020 elections this is going to be a

52
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,709
thing for a long time so now the

53
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,900
question is why do the Democratic

54
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,700
candidates agree with Trump on the

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,980
basics when it comes to China what does

56
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,769
America want to achieve with this trade

57
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,080
war and what are the reasons behind it

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,730
well today we're going to look at all of

59
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,160
these questions but before we do let's

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,610
take a look back at the history

61
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,620
protectionism awakens the first

62
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,810
character of this story is the World

63
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,600
Trade Organization also known as the WTO

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,210
it was created in 1995 with the aim of

65
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,760
helping international trade so the first

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,920
question you might have is well why do

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,690
we need an organization to trade with

68
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,210
other countries is an example let's say

69
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,850
Canadians want to buy Colombian

70
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,340
pineapples they decide to cut all the

71
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,800
tariffs on Colombian fruit Colombia says

72
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,020
well isn't this great now we have a new

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,420
country buying out pineapples whoa but

74
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,550
in the meantime they keep tariffs on the

75
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,730
Canadian apples that they import why Bob

76
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,680
because they want to protect their local

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,750
producers at this point the Canadians

78
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,030
would say look man we're letting you

79
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,560
compete with our local farmers but

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,970
you're not letting us compete with yours

81
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,570
it's not cool this is when the WTO comes

82
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,190
into the picture

83
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,840
all the country members agreed on a rule

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
called a reciprocity which means that if

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,880
Columbia imposes 10% tariffs on foreign

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,800
fruit then the rest of the countries

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,770
will all put tariffs on Colombian fruit

88
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,980
so far so good right I think it sounds

89
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,319
pretty fair but hold on just a second

90
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,959
because this is not the only rule for

91
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,000
example there are some rules to avoid

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,970
dumping or abuses this is why in a

93
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,830
previous video I told you how the

94
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,870
European Union sells french fries to

95
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,610
Columbia tons at the market Christ

96
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,220
because EU farmers have grants of course

97
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,680
this makes a lot of countries angry and

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,769
this is why Columbia has taken this case

99
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,269
to the WTO courts I don't know what

100
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,350
you're gonna say to me now you're gonna

101
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,120
say I'll Simon all of this sounds

102
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
wonderful doesn't it it's so beautiful

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,019
it's so great they're holding hands that

104
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,169
probably singing Kumbaya what is all BS

105
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,210
we all know that a farmer from Kentucky

106
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,370
has tractors irrigation systems and

107
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,500
technology but a Zambian farmer has a

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,380
donkey and a plough it's absolutely

109
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,300
clear that the dude in Kentucky is that

110
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,590
a bit more productive than the guy in

111
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,160
Zambia this is far from equal

112
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,680
opportunity isn't it well this is the

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,140
important part of this story the WTO is

114
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,600
aware of this and so there is something

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,590
called developing nation status

116
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,500
[Music]

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,240
basically developing nations have some

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,340
privileges and they do not need to

119
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,979
follow some of the rules and back in

120
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,130
2001 when China entered the WTO they had

121
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,350
this developing nations status thanks to

122
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,150
this the international community turned

123
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,150
a blind eye to many things so now you

124
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,639
might wonder well what's the issue with

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,100
China what are they doing so wrong so

126
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,919
basically when it comes to exports China

127
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,460
loves the WTO that's why we have so much

128
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,919
stuff with now that made in China or is

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,870
in there on the side but good luck

130
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,150
trying to sell or invest in China

131
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,800
because they have one of the most

132
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,139
protectionist regimes that you could

133
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,360
possibly imagine we told you many times

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,360
here on visual politic China is still a

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,880
communist dictatorship and you can still

136
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,300
tell the government still has five-year

137
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,060
plans like the old Soviet Union did and

138
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,100
there are still big state-owned

139
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,470
companies with whom you just can't

140
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,800
compete and now you could say well Simon

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,120
there are thousands of American

142
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,229
companies investing and building

143
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:04,280
factories in China well yes absolutely

144
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,080
there are but if you want to start a

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,940
company there well first you need to

146
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,130
partner with a local business and in

147
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,260
most cases next each foreign worker you

148
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,240
employ he'll also have to employ a

149
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,520
Chinese worker in the same position why

150
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,889
because China loves to learn from

151
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:21,570
foreign technology don't believe me

152
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,910
here's a good example Siemens the German

153
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,830
company Siemens won a contract with the

154
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,180
Chinese government to build high-speed

155
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,039
trains they were really happy because

156
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,930
there was really good money so what

157
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,090
happens Chinese workers learns from

158
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,490
Siemens as proprietary technology years

159
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,470
later China starts the world's biggest

160
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,440
high-speed train manufacturers CRR see

161
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,660
and now they compete face to face with

162
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,690
Siemens on the German market check this

163
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,250
out

164
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,300
[Music]

165
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,670
is trained technology rolls into German

166
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,530
but this is just one example according

167
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,150
to Donald Trump intellectual property

168
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,700
stealing by China translates to 300

169
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,500
billion dollar losses for American

170
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,390
companies every single year and fighting

171
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,520
against this is the cornerstone of his

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,730
agenda we must protect our borders from

173
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,850
the ravages of other countries making

174
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,790
our products stealing our companies and

175
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:25,530
destroying our jobs protection will lead

176
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,220
to great prosperity and strength so is

177
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,680
he right well as we usually say on

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,830
visual politic yes and no it is true

179
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,080
that China didn't play fair in many

180
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,940
cases but it's also true that many

181
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,700
foreign companies sell in China Lego the

182
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,950
toy blocks manufacturer has survived in

183
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,930
part because they opened markets in

184
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,270
China but regardless of what we think is

185
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,370
right the truth is that Trump strategy

186
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,470
is to be tough on China so they follow

187
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,350
international trade rules how well let's

188
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,100
have a look at that right now

189
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,050
[Music]

190
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,900
the last tariff everything started in

191
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,140
March 2018 when drum impose tariffs on

192
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,180
Chinese steel and aluminium one month

193
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,950
later they went further than that about

194
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,850
25% tariffs on 1300 Chinese products and

195
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,330
yes 25% is high in a matter of hours

196
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,640
Beijing answered in the same way and

197
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,980
applied tariffs on soy as well as plane

198
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,230
in automobile parts basically these are

199
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,210
the American products that China buys

200
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,250
the most so these tariffs had an

201
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,350
immediate impact on both economies and

202
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,840
this is where Trump began using his most

203
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,990
fearful weapon in this war the Twitter

204
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,600
menace

205
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,340
we are not in a trade war with China

206
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,800
that war was lost many years ago by the

207
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,990
foolish or incompetent people who

208
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,120
represented the United States now we

209
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,830
have a trade deficit of five hundred

210
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,110
billion dollars a year with intellectual

211
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,990
property theft of another 300 billion we

212
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,550
cannot let this continue

213
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,740
so after this Trump kept putting more

214
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,600
and more tariffs on Chinese intermediate

215
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,670
products these are goods like microchips

216
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,100
that you need in order to manufacture

217
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,660
finalized goods tariffs are working far

218
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,000
better than anyone anticipated China's

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,060
market dropped 27% in the last four

220
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,130
months and they are talking to us our

221
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,080
market is stronger than ever and will go

222
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,640
up dramatically when these horrible

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,110
trade deals are successfully

224
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,720
renegotiated America first and the trade

225
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,940
wars continues after Trump attacked Xi

226
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:36,050
Jinping struck back China retaliates

227
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,910
against Trump with fresh tariffs on US

228
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,520
liquid natural gas the consequences of

229
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,560
this were big and immediate since

230
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,330
America started exporting liquefied

231
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,400
natural gas back in 2016

232
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,500
China has been one of its best clients

233
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,060
after the introduction with this new

234
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,980
tariff American gas import has dropped

235
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,170
by more than 60 percent wait a minute

236
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,180
because the trade wars are far from over

237
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,970
why a year ago Trump and Xi Jingping

238
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,460
meds at the g20 summit in Buenos Aires

239
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,050
they made a truce and announced

240
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,660
negotiations however China didn't stick

241
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,180
to America's deadlines so what did the

242
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,170
White House do

243
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,510
raise tariffs again this time on more

244
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,550
than 5,000 Chinese products you know

245
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,320
what happens with Xi Jingping for each

246
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
tariff Trump imposed he answered with a

247
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,160
similar one and the story kept going

248
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,560
again and again until this who blocks

249
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,860
Huawei after Donald Trump edict yes I

250
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,540
know in this case they haven't applied

251
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,220
these strongest measures against far

252
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,680
away but still the company was heavily

253
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,870
damaged by this in fact their new luxury

254
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,060
phone is selling really badly in Europe

255
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,470
because it doesn't have Android or

256
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,690
Google services the story is far from

257
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,050
over

258
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,510
since August 2019 Washington has kept

259
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,460
raising tariffs little by little why do

260
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,290
they do this little by little because

261
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,930
this

262
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,809
Trump delays some China tariffs to limit

263
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,850
impact on holiday shopping as you can

264
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,529
imagine the problem with this war is not

265
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,629
only raising prices all over the place

266
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,699
but also uncertainty for businesses

267
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:09,259
don't forget the company's plan their

268
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:11,389
strategies four or five years ahead but

269
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,069
how can you plan anything if they can

270
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:15,439
double tariffs on anything you import or

271
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:18,110
export at any moment so now the question

272
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,819
is how is this affecting America's

273
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,800
economy and how might it affect a would

274
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,139
be Trump reelection for 2020 well let's

275
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:31,790
have a look at that rise of Trump as I

276
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,259
told you at the beginning for years

277
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,480
China had a special status with the WTO

278
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,639
everybody knew they were cheating that

279
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,410
everybody expected they would change

280
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,449
overtime Trumper has been the first

281
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:43,579
American presidents to open Pandora's

282
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,149
box

283
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,980
so how did the Democratic Party react

284
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,869
well of course everyone criticized the

285
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:49,790
way Trump is doing things but they all

286
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,220
seem to agree on the basics for example

287
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,329
one of the candidates for the Democratic

288
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,939
primaries is Joe Biden Biden was the

289
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:57,829
vice president during the times brac

290
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,689
banner and some people believed that he

291
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,220
would bring things back to how they were

292
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,649
before but it doesn't always look as

293
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,810
though death is what

294
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,890
[Music]

295
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,110
fighting slams Trump's trade war even as

296
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,269
some calls to quote get tough on China

297
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:15,640
tell us a Bernie Sanders is tough to

298
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,200
bite at Sanders claims that American

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
workers are lowering their quality of

300
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,649
life because of Chinese competitors so

301
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,540
chances are he would continue the trade

302
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,350
war with China

303
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,820
don't forget Elizabeth Warren inter

304
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,550
so-called patriotism check this out with

305
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,680
Warren could be even tougher than Trump

306
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,260
on China says analyst of course it's one

307
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,060
thing to be tough on China and another

308
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,220
to support Trump's agenda the devil is

309
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,050
in the details but at least at the

310
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,910
moment we can say that the trade war has

311
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,070
been a triumph for Trump's ideology he

312
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,250
made all the candidates by at least the

313
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,350
foundation of his proposals so what's

314
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,570
the price for all of this we won't know

315
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,370
until the elections it is clear that

316
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,350
China has a lot to lose on this but make

317
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,930
no mistake Americans are also paying

318
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,880
this could have a big impact on Trump's

319
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,410
re-election for example the soy

320
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,329
producers in the Midwest to selling less

321
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,399
and less due to China's tariffs and so

322
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,810
where the factories and the Rust Belt

323
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,700
who've now pay much more for the raw

324
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,320
materials that they use we've already

325
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,970
explained on visual politic how the

326
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,010
steel tariffs hit American icons like

327
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,530
harley-davidson very hard

328
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,910
[Music]

329
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,190
Joe's economy is failing exactly where

330
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,260
he needs it to succeed the states that

331
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,760
are suffering the most to Wisconsin

332
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,500
Michigan and Pennsylvania where Trump

333
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,200
beat Clinton by just one asset a slight

334
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,270
change in the results in 2020 might give

335
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,040
the presidency to the Democrats let's

336
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,870
not forget that we are talking about a

337
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,270
difference of only 80,000 votes the

338
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,160
trade war is also doing terrible damage

339
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,870
and China are not as strong as we

340
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,060
thought in fact they may have cheated in

341
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,890
the way they calculate the macroeconomic

342
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,170
figures but even if we gave face value

343
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,000
to their figures their economy is not

344
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,820
growing as fast as it used to

345
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,620
but the moment it looks as if she Jing

346
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,170
Bing will wait to make compromises until

347
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,400
he knows it will be in the White House

348
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,210
next year

349
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,740
that's no matter who wins the elections

350
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,690
a relationship between China and America

351
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,610
will never be the same and if he thought

352
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,590
Trump is willing to soften tariffs just

353
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:20,790
because of the electoral campaign signs

354
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,370
Hong Kong democracy legislation angering

355
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,400
China on December the 15th 2019 Trump

356
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,150
and Xi Jingping

357
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,040
signed a truce that will last until the

358
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,810
next meeting China has committed to

359
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,550
eliminate Sun tariffs to agricultural

360
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,140
imports and America will do the same

361
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,120
with some electronic components but the

362
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,560
war is far from over

363
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
in the meantime Democrats are comparing

364
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,430
Republicans to the dark side and Trump

365
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,200
portrays himself as the chosen one and

366
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,700
no this is not just a gimmick to keep

367
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,350
the Star Wars metaphor going to the end

368
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,520
of the video he really did save us

369
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,650
somebody had it do it so I'm taking on

370
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,530
China I'm taking on China on trade and

371
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,720
