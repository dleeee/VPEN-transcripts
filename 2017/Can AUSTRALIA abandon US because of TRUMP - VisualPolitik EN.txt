3
00:00:07.67 --> 00:00:11.820
let's start today's video with a

4
00:00:09.78 --> 00:00:14.370
question which country would you say is

5
00:00:11.82 --> 00:00:16.230
the u.s. is biggest a line is a Canada

6
00:00:14.37 --> 00:00:18.570
they do see UK and what what about

7
00:00:16.23 --> 00:00:20.699
Israel now this is not an easy question

8
00:00:18.57 --> 00:00:21.449
to answer and it definitely depends on

9
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.460
who you ask

10
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.350
however there is a country which has

11
00:00:23.46 --> 00:00:27.390
improved its alliance with the US a

12
00:00:25.35 --> 00:00:28.980
great deal over the last few years it

13
00:00:27.39 --> 00:00:30.660
has improved enough that it is for

14
00:00:28.98 --> 00:00:33.390
Republicans the best friend of the

15
00:00:30.66 --> 00:00:35.850
country unions biggest ally more so than

16
00:00:33.39 --> 00:00:38.250
any other country I know it's not Canada

17
00:00:35.85 --> 00:00:40.559
and though it's not the UK or Israel it

18
00:00:38.25 --> 00:00:44.809
is Australia the country of surf

19
00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.809
kangaroos and the Sydney Opera House

20
00:00:46.01 --> 00:00:50.700
surprised well you shouldn't be

21
00:00:48.75 --> 00:00:52.649
Australia is dear viewer the only

22
00:00:50.7 --> 00:00:55.230
country in the world to afford with the

23
00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.570
u.s. in all of their big Wars World War

24
00:00:55.23 --> 00:00:59.820
1 World War 2 Korea Vietnam the Gulf War

25
00:00:57.57 --> 00:01:02.250
Afghanistan Iraq and now also the

26
00:00:59.82 --> 00:01:04.170
operations against Isis for the Pentagon

27
00:01:02.25 --> 00:01:06.930
we could almost say that Australia is to

28
00:01:04.17 --> 00:01:09.060
the USA what the score is to a movie

29
00:01:06.93 --> 00:01:11.159
that at first might go unnoticed that

30
00:01:09.06 --> 00:01:13.229
remove that music and you can see that

31
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.409
it's really something that's going to be

32
00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.540
missed on January the 28th 2017 and

33
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
despite this all the lions Donald Trump

34
00:01:18.54 --> 00:01:23.340
decided to hang up the phone on Malcolm

35
00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.869
Turnbull Australia's Prime Minister not

36
00:01:23.34 --> 00:01:26.640
just that though before he told him to

37
00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.049
get lost and hung up on him Trump

38
00:01:26.64 --> 00:01:30.329
accused him of trying to export

39
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.619
terrorists through the United States and

40
00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.909
this was all just about a slight

41
00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.840
disagreement that these two countries

42
00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.009
had over 1,250 refugees well that's a

43
00:01:36.84 --> 00:01:40.350
story that we're going to get into

44
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.479
another day yes this brief diplomatic

45
00:01:40.35 --> 00:01:44.040
tussle might not seem like that much in

46
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.170
the grand scheme of things but it has

47
00:01:44.04 --> 00:01:47.909
had a lot of consequences many

48
00:01:46.17 --> 00:01:49.649
Australians are left wondering if it

49
00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.750
isn't time to start cooling off the

50
00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.610
relationship with the United States by

51
00:01:51.75 --> 00:01:56.610
just a little

52
00:01:54.61 --> 00:01:59.560
[Music]

53
00:01:56.61 --> 00:02:01.540
so well naturally this is something we

54
00:01:59.56 --> 00:02:03.220
started wondering as well it raises

55
00:02:01.54 --> 00:02:05.230
questions like how important is

56
00:02:03.22 --> 00:02:07.090
Australia for the United States and was

57
00:02:05.23 --> 00:02:09.220
it really sensible for Trump's hang up

58
00:02:07.09 --> 00:02:10.990
the phone on his greatest ally and what

59
00:02:09.22 --> 00:02:12.700
kind of consequences is this going to

60
00:02:10.99 --> 00:02:15.150
have for him well let's take a look

61
00:02:12.7 --> 00:02:15.150
shall we

62
00:02:15.96 --> 00:02:22.180
time for Asia it's probably not news to

63
00:02:20.89 --> 00:02:23.980
you especially if you've been following

64
00:02:22.18 --> 00:02:26.050
this channel for a while who else has

65
00:02:23.98 --> 00:02:27.970
changed and both the political and

66
00:02:26.05 --> 00:02:30.550
economic power centers are moving

67
00:02:27.97 --> 00:02:32.080
quickly to Asia by 2020 it is expected

68
00:02:30.55 --> 00:02:34.180
that more than half of the world's

69
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:37.180
economy and population will be located

70
00:02:34.18 --> 00:02:39.310
in this continent and China is emerging

71
00:02:37.18 --> 00:02:41.620
as a new superpower and well that's a

72
00:02:39.31 --> 00:02:47.410
fact up until now a map of the world has

73
00:02:41.62 --> 00:02:49.450
looks pretty close to this one well from

74
00:02:47.41 --> 00:02:53.950
now on we're going to see things looking

75
00:02:49.45 --> 00:02:55.810
closer and closer to this one as you can

76
00:02:53.95 --> 00:02:57.850
see Europe is leaving the center of the

77
00:02:55.81 --> 00:02:59.500
world and is taking up a position in the

78
00:02:57.85 --> 00:03:02.110
corner all right so that's just a fun

79
00:02:59.5 --> 00:03:05.110
comparison but we can't really deny that

80
00:03:02.11 --> 00:03:07.270
the world is changing what tell us that

81
00:03:05.11 --> 00:03:09.790
it's where you've been living this whole

82
00:03:07.27 --> 00:03:11.380
time the 21st century it's going to the

83
00:03:09.79 --> 00:03:13.390
Asia's century some things we've

84
00:03:11.38 --> 00:03:14.920
discussed a bunch here a visual politics

85
00:03:13.39 --> 00:03:17.080
that is why former US President Barack

86
00:03:14.92 --> 00:03:19.270
Obama decided to bet strongly on Asia

87
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:21.610
and make this continent is top priority

88
00:03:19.27 --> 00:03:23.320
for American diplomacy it was under

89
00:03:21.61 --> 00:03:25.750
these circumstances that Australia

90
00:03:23.32 --> 00:03:28.209
became such a valuable friend but how

91
00:03:25.75 --> 00:03:30.340
close is this friendship between the US

92
00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.820
and Australia well let's have a closer

93
00:03:30.34 --> 00:03:33.470
look

94
00:03:30.82 --> 00:03:39.560
[Music]

95
00:03:33.47 --> 00:03:41.570
a big alliance in November of 2011

96
00:03:39.56 --> 00:03:43.160
Barack Obama and Australia's prime

97
00:03:41.57 --> 00:03:45.140
minister at the time Julia Gillard

98
00:03:43.16 --> 00:03:46.940
finding military agreements which meant

99
00:03:45.14 --> 00:03:49.220
a new era for military cooperation

100
00:03:46.94 --> 00:03:51.260
between these two countries we could

101
00:03:49.22 --> 00:03:53.440
always say that this new treaty started

102
00:03:51.26 --> 00:03:56.090
a military friendship between the US and

103
00:03:53.44 --> 00:03:57.740
Australia in fact let's take a look at

104
00:03:56.09 --> 00:04:01.010
the description the New York Times wrote

105
00:03:57.74 --> 00:04:02.720
about this agreement the agreement with

106
00:04:01.01 --> 00:04:04.940
Australia amounts the first long-term

107
00:04:02.72 --> 00:04:07.040
expansion of the American military's

108
00:04:04.94 --> 00:04:09.170
presence in the Pacific since the end of

109
00:04:07.04 --> 00:04:11.150
the Vietnam War but well what did this

110
00:04:09.17 --> 00:04:12.680
agreements what did it really mean

111
00:04:11.15 --> 00:04:14.780
well for starters thanks to the treaty

112
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:17.690
the US can deploy a fighting force of up

113
00:04:14.78 --> 00:04:19.370
to 2,500 soldiers in Australia these

114
00:04:17.69 --> 00:04:21.230
troops are from the Marine Corps and

115
00:04:19.37 --> 00:04:23.330
they are able to quickly deploy in the

116
00:04:21.23 --> 00:04:25.400
event of any conflict but don't think

117
00:04:23.33 --> 00:04:26.660
that this is the end of things since the

118
00:04:25.4 --> 00:04:28.070
collaboration between these two

119
00:04:26.66 --> 00:04:29.690
countries has grown and grown it has

120
00:04:28.07 --> 00:04:32.120
grown enough to become an essential

121
00:04:29.69 --> 00:04:34.070
relationship for Washington it is not

122
00:04:32.12 --> 00:04:36.080
just the Marines the United States wants

123
00:04:34.07 --> 00:04:38.150
to make Australia the key home base for

124
00:04:36.08 --> 00:04:39.280
their activities in both the Pacific and

125
00:04:38.15 --> 00:04:42.439
Indian Oceans

126
00:04:39.28 --> 00:04:44.939
[Music]

127
00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.009
so now you're probably getting the idea

128
00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.509
the US wants to have access to landing

129
00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.039
strips situated in the north of the

130
00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.099
country from here they want to be able

131
00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.259
to deploy b2 and b-52 bombers they also

132
00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.909
want to set up a large naval base near

133
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.499
Perth for their enormous fleet of

134
00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.860
nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear

135
00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:04.980
submarines

136
00:05:00.86 --> 00:05:08.340
[Music]

137
00:05:04.98 --> 00:05:10.050
and there's more the United States is

138
00:05:08.34 --> 00:05:11.640
also trying to locate and monitoring

139
00:05:10.05 --> 00:05:13.380
centers and missile launch warning

140
00:05:11.64 --> 00:05:15.090
facilities there too they even want to

141
00:05:13.38 --> 00:05:17.310
rent part of the koko islands in the

142
00:05:15.09 --> 00:05:19.680
Indian Ocean which are under Australian

143
00:05:17.31 --> 00:05:21.240
sovereignty so you may now be thinking

144
00:05:19.68 --> 00:05:23.250
what do you mean why would the United

145
00:05:21.24 --> 00:05:25.260
States want to rent some random remote

146
00:05:23.25 --> 00:05:27.150
islands in the Indian Ocean well the

147
00:05:25.26 --> 00:05:28.770
answer is actually pretty clear the US

148
00:05:27.15 --> 00:05:30.960
wants to locate their long-range

149
00:05:28.77 --> 00:05:32.940
surveillance aircrafts and armed drones

150
00:05:30.96 --> 00:05:34.710
on the koko Islands they also want to

151
00:05:32.94 --> 00:05:36.360
use this archipelago as another

152
00:05:34.71 --> 00:05:39.120
deployment center for their bombers in

153
00:05:36.36 --> 00:05:41.070
case of war but wait because there is

154
00:05:39.12 --> 00:05:43.080
still more the United States wants to

155
00:05:41.07 --> 00:05:45.120
improve the integration between their

156
00:05:43.08 --> 00:05:46.770
army and the Australian military so that

157
00:05:45.12 --> 00:05:49.290
the two forces could work together

158
00:05:46.77 --> 00:05:50.850
whenever needed now if you don't exactly

159
00:05:49.29 --> 00:05:53.460
understand what the results of this

160
00:05:50.85 --> 00:05:55.230
could be well do consider this in the

161
00:05:53.46 --> 00:05:57.240
last few years Australia has carried out

162
00:05:55.23 --> 00:05:58.860
a significant renovation of their

163
00:05:57.24 --> 00:06:01.110
military equipment we're talking about

164
00:05:58.86 --> 00:06:03.210
purchase contracts worth billions and

165
00:06:01.11 --> 00:06:05.430
billions of dollars and the monkeys

166
00:06:03.21 --> 00:06:07.710
there is quite a lot of American

167
00:06:05.43 --> 00:06:09.330
material so it's a controversial f-35 is

168
00:06:07.71 --> 00:06:11.540
an example Australia is committed to

169
00:06:09.33 --> 00:06:15.000
buying 72 units which is going to cost

170
00:06:11.54 --> 00:06:16.830
19 billion dollars this is a serious

171
00:06:15.0 --> 00:06:18.600
amount of cash and we're talking about

172
00:06:16.83 --> 00:06:20.760
the country with little more than 24

173
00:06:18.6 --> 00:06:23.400
million inhabitants here so to a person

174
00:06:20.76 --> 00:06:24.789
it's really a lot of money

175
00:06:23.4 --> 00:06:27.560
[Music]

176
00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:30.050
all right so now you've got to be

177
00:06:27.56 --> 00:06:32.060
wondering why Australia right well

178
00:06:30.05 --> 00:06:34.069
that's for several reasons first because

179
00:06:32.06 --> 00:06:35.960
both countries are culturally similar

180
00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.370
and as we've said before they fought

181
00:06:35.96 --> 00:06:39.050
together many times

182
00:06:37.37 --> 00:06:41.569
Seton's it's because Australia's

183
00:06:39.05 --> 00:06:43.849
geographical position is almost perfect

184
00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.919
it's situated between the Indian and the

185
00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.319
Pacific Oceans and it is close enough to

186
00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.090
the hot spots in Asia that the US could

187
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.099
carry out attacks and deploy troops

188
00:06:50.09 --> 00:06:54.020
there quickly and last but not least

189
00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.360
there's another important factor

190
00:06:54.02 --> 00:06:58.550
Australia is an important energy raw

191
00:06:56.36 --> 00:07:00.259
material and food supplier to China so

192
00:06:58.55 --> 00:07:02.300
the Pentagon believes that in the event

193
00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.009
of a conflict or tough tensions between

194
00:07:02.3 --> 00:07:06.289
the two countries it would be convenient

195
00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.669
to have control over Australia

196
00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.919
absolutely well what about the other

197
00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:11.750
side what do you be Australian swans

198
00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.419
they basically understand that the US

199
00:07:11.75 --> 00:07:18.189
can sort of be an insurance policy no

200
00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.189
way to ensure their own security

201
00:07:20.91 --> 00:07:25.680
however there are some voices who

202
00:07:23.25 --> 00:07:27.870
disagree and these voices they seem to

203
00:07:25.68 --> 00:07:29.460
be growing louder and so the Trump

204
00:07:27.87 --> 00:07:35.960
hasn't helped with his whole hanging out

205
00:07:29.46 --> 00:07:39.630
the same thing but Chinese alternative

206
00:07:35.96 --> 00:07:41.610
now China is by far the largest trade

207
00:07:39.63 --> 00:07:44.010
partner for Australia it is the first

208
00:07:41.61 --> 00:07:45.660
destination for Australia's exports it's

209
00:07:44.01 --> 00:07:47.310
the country of origins and many of the

210
00:07:45.66 --> 00:07:49.410
immigrants coming to Australia and

211
00:07:47.31 --> 00:07:51.360
besides there are more and more Chinese

212
00:07:49.41 --> 00:07:53.790
people who visit the country every year

213
00:07:51.36 --> 00:07:56.280
or who have decided to study that anyway

214
00:07:53.79 --> 00:07:58.530
the Chinese mean a lot of money for the

215
00:07:56.28 --> 00:08:02.310
Australians and well that has its

216
00:07:58.53 --> 00:08:03.810
consequences a 2016 survey conducted by

217
00:08:02.31 --> 00:08:05.910
the public policy group Lowy Institute

218
00:08:03.81 --> 00:08:07.710
asked respondents to identify the

219
00:08:05.91 --> 00:08:10.140
country that was more important to

220
00:08:07.71 --> 00:08:12.720
Australia 43% chose the United States

221
00:08:10.14 --> 00:08:14.970
and 43% China in 2014

222
00:08:12.72 --> 00:08:18.120
48% had answered the United States and

223
00:08:14.97 --> 00:08:20.760
only 37% had chosen China New York Times

224
00:08:18.12 --> 00:08:23.040
and look under 45 year olds clearly have

225
00:08:20.76 --> 00:08:24.390
opted for China and almost half of the

226
00:08:23.04 --> 00:08:26.520
country's population believes their

227
00:08:24.39 --> 00:08:28.350
country should keep some distance from

228
00:08:26.52 --> 00:08:30.060
Trump's America pork eating and

229
00:08:28.35 --> 00:08:31.680
important Australian ex Prime Minister

230
00:08:30.06 --> 00:08:33.300
for example is one of the personalities

231
00:08:31.68 --> 00:08:35.550
who thinks it would be better to try to

232
00:08:33.3 --> 00:08:37.680
improve relations with China and let

233
00:08:35.55 --> 00:08:39.419
relations with the United States cool

234
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:42.840
down a bit and pay particular attention

235
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:45.120
to how he explains his position the

236

Society of ours is a better society than

237
00:08:45.12 --> 00:08:49.530
the United States it's more even it's

238
00:08:47.01 --> 00:08:51.510
more fair we've had a 50% increase in

239
00:08:49.53 --> 00:08:54.720
real incomes in the last 20 years

240
00:08:51.51 --> 00:08:56.880
median America has had zero zero so now

241
00:08:54.72 --> 00:08:58.890
Australia has made some kind of gestures

242
00:08:56.88 --> 00:09:00.480
towards the Asian giant as an example

243
00:08:58.89 --> 00:09:02.130
went by the way Washington didn't like

244
00:09:00.48 --> 00:09:04.230
this at all the country decided to

245
00:09:02.13 --> 00:09:06.750
participate in the Asian infrastructure

246
00:09:04.23 --> 00:09:08.880
investment bank an institution led by

247
00:09:06.75 --> 00:09:10.800
China whose aim is to increase China's

248
00:09:08.88 --> 00:09:12.180
influence in the country the Australian

249
00:09:10.8 --> 00:09:14.700
government itself has made it clear that

250
00:09:12.18 --> 00:09:16.680
China is above all a source for

251
00:09:14.7 --> 00:09:18.000
opportunities for the country luckily

252
00:09:16.68 --> 00:09:19.740
for Trump though there are still many

253
00:09:18.0 --> 00:09:21.190
things that protect his relationship

254
00:09:19.74 --> 00:09:24.089
with Australia

255
00:09:21.19 --> 00:09:26.980
[Music]

256
00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:32.380
the American culture and the fear of the

257
00:09:26.98 --> 00:09:34.320
Chinese dragon Australian and the US are

258
00:09:32.38 --> 00:09:37.120
politically culturally and economically

259
00:09:34.32 --> 00:09:38.800
similar countries they are so similar in

260
00:09:37.12 --> 00:09:40.269
fact at an international level that it

261
00:09:38.8 --> 00:09:42.160
could be argued that Australia is

262
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:44.529
nothing more than an extension of the

263
00:09:42.16 --> 00:09:46.209
American lifestyle in Asia and the truth

264
00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:49.420
is that a lot of Australians are pretty

265
00:09:46.209 --> 00:09:51.339
pound to be considered that way whatever

266
00:09:49.42 --> 00:09:53.050
happens I will not dull my affection for

267
00:09:51.339 --> 00:09:54.850
the American people and the best of

268
00:09:53.05 --> 00:09:57.070
American culture it was not raised in

269
00:09:54.85 --> 00:09:59.350
America but I was raised in the American

270
00:09:57.07 --> 00:10:02.050
Century I'm not yet ready to say goodbye

271
00:09:59.35 --> 00:10:03.940
Lisa prior furthermore the United States

272
00:10:02.05 --> 00:10:06.010
is still the largest investor in

273
00:10:03.94 --> 00:10:10.180
Australia and investment that exceeds

274
00:10:06.01 --> 00:10:12.190
500 billion dollars also the fact that

275
00:10:10.18 --> 00:10:14.500
china is still a dictatorship is making

276
00:10:12.19 --> 00:10:16.839
Australia suspicious many simply don't

277
00:10:14.5 --> 00:10:18.399
trust Beijing's intentions in fact the

278
00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:20.290
government has stopped many Chinese

279
00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:22.510
investment operations that intended to

280
00:10:20.29 --> 00:10:23.920
fine land in Australia so we can say

281
00:10:22.51 --> 00:10:25.269
that it kind of all of indicates that

282
00:10:23.92 --> 00:10:27.250
the alliance with the US will continue

283
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:29.019
but the Australians well there are very

284
00:10:27.25 --> 00:10:30.310
practical people and they have made it

285
00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:32.649
clear that they don't want to be

286
00:10:30.31 --> 00:10:34.480
affected by a future hypothetical war of

287
00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:36.490
power between China and the United

288
00:10:34.48 --> 00:10:37.990
States so well that's what we think here

289
00:10:36.49 --> 00:10:39.430
at visual politic and now we'd love to

290
00:10:37.99 --> 00:10:41.410
know what you think do you think the

291
00:10:39.43 --> 00:10:42.760
United States will despite Trumbo

292
00:10:41.41 --> 00:10:44.350
carrying out the projects they had

293
00:10:42.76 --> 00:10:46.029
planned to do in Australia or do you

294
00:10:44.35 --> 00:10:48.010
think China will achieve more and more

295
00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:49.660
influence in the country and most

296
00:10:48.01 --> 00:10:51.339
importantly how would you feel if Trump

297
00:10:49.66 --> 00:10:53.139
hung up the phone on your country's
