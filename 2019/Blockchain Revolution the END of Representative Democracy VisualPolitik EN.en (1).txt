the description below we spoke about

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,300
what money is its main problems and why

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,670
cryptocurrencies are here to stay to

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,189
recap the speed anonymity safety and

12
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,200
independence of cryptocurrencies which

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,390
aren't run by governments politicians or

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,940
any council of wise men aren't features

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,100
we can ignore therefore even though it

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,840
may seem like they went out of fashion

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,870
it's very likely that one way or another

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,590
the cryptocurrency rush will be back

[Music]

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,250
now I want a minute Simon because some

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,540
of you might be now thinking well that's

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,489
all well and good but at the end of the

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,560
day cryptocurrencies they just don't

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,720
have state support if that's what you're

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,770
thinking well why don't we ask our

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,930
Argentinian or Venezuelan friends what

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,390
they think of state support and what it

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,880
really amounts to little bits of love

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,040
would the monarchy anything long what do

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,210
you think or something he knows but

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,860
there wasn't money in it okay like him

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,990
to get it dinner is you a little guy

33
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,520
what's more we can't forget the based on

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,650
evidence the exact opposite usually

35
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,470
happens central bank's end up supporting

36
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,090
wasteful governments how well that's

37
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,619
simply by running the money-making

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,080
machine printing money and buying

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,360
governmental debt all this in exchange

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,430
of course for creating inflation and

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,350
sinking the currency's value state

42
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,390
support not really sounding so great now

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,060
but enough about cryptocurrencies as we

44
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,410
mentioned in a previous video they are

45
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,149
just the first application of a new

46
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,070
technology a technology that can change

47
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,380
society forever so listen up

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,230
[Music]

49
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:09,880
watch a you probably already know the

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,260
blockchain is the technology that

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,630
supports Bitcoin but there's a bit more

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,600
to it than that

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,430
you see blockchain is like a huge book

54
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,380
where all the Bitcoin transactions that

55
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,300
have ever taken place all over the world

56
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,430
are registered to ensure great accuracy

57
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,080
of payments transactions are recorded

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,450
and made available to everyone in that

59
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,730
way blockchain works like an unalterable

60
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,790
public record a consensus tool among all

61
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,720
of its users and this implies nothing

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,760
less than a revolution it's the ends of

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,370
a hierarchically based order allow me to

64
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,989
explain since the beginning of time

65
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,790
people have always needed the authority

66
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,680
of third parties or institutions to

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,600
coordinate their actions this might be

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,520
Kings governors notaries registrar's

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,110
officials experts judges central banks

70
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,180
supervisor and thief the list goes on

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,660
and it's a really long list and this

72
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,239
list is mostly made up of elites who

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,400
charge a lot of money and who generally

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,769
made these processes very complicated

75
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:09,970
and rather drawn-out

76
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,769
just think about what we do if we want

77
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:13,000
to buy a house we have to deal with

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,070
solicitors estate agents council

79
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,620
officials banks the list it goes on once

80
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,570
again but now blockchain makes it

81
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,040
possible to simplify all of these

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,560
procedures to do them almost immediately

83
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,360
safely and there's a much lower cost

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,670
imagine for example if we replaced real

85
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,680
estate property records with blockchain

86
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,390
technology well what would happen here

87
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,400
basically with blockchain everyone could

88
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
be informed simultaneously that the

89
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,970
house in question has been transferred

90
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,680
and paid for what's more the blockchain

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
records and communications would be

92
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,410
unalterable and secure from manipulation

93
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,590
[Music]

94
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,989
with blockchain any user who wants to

95
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,180
can see which homes are associated with

96
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,950
each account slit they won't know the

97
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,230
identity of the person behinds that

98
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,880
account and the same can happen with

99
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,489
money goods and any valuable records

100
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,380
this might be vehicles company shares

101
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,170
contracts copyrights patents wills etc

102
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,489
this means that will no longer need a

103
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:05,830
central bank or companies like Visa or

104
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,019
indeed any government authority to

105
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:09,730
validate a transaction it's the

106
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,680
consensual knowledge of this transaction

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,810
made transparent to all which will

108
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,620
validate it all right so now you might

109
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,780
be wondering well is this actually that

110
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,549
disruptive well blockchain is an

111
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:23,229
emerging technology and we still don't

112
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,940
understand all of its implications or

113
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,620
its possibilities it's complicated

114
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,970
because it's sort of like if you were

115
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,590
trying to explain a credit card to a

116
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,330
banker from the Middle Ages but the

117
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,280
truth is that we can already see some

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,350
very interesting applications in a

119
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,880
previous video we talked about smart

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,620
contract so now we're going to see a

121
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,660
very important aspect of them something

122
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,700
that's going to be exciting to some

123
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,940
bands probably worrisome to others as I

124
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,200
did with our previous blockchain video

125
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,070
I'm going to ask you to keep an open

126
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,210
mind for this one

127
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,229
[Music]

128
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,340
the daos

129
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,699
and smart contracts so let's consider

130
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,870
what could be the most surprising

131
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,610
blockchain application this is an

132
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,500
application we could revolutionize many

133
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,120
of the global institutions that we all

134
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,639
know a dao is simply an organization

135
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,409
regulated and directed by smart

136
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,210
contracts within the blockchain it has

137
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,219
condensed rules that are known by all

138
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,139
there's no bosses coordinators or

139
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,180
hierarchies there's no need for a

140
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,800
superior entity to control everything to

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,479
understand this better so far in history

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,789
Nanyan assets have always been owned by

143
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,770
one person or group of people however

144
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,930
from now on all of that could really

145
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,530
change

146
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,629
can you imagine companies owns not by

147
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:35,430
humans but my machines can you imagine

148
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,889
company is owned by a few lines of code

149
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,780
in the cloud maybe you can imagine a

150
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,759
company or an NGO without any human

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,740
workers now thanks to blockchain and

152
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,629
artificial intelligence this could all

153
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,779
be possible

154
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,490
but just as many of you may be freaking

155
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,050
out or thinking that we've lost our

156
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,270
minds here are some examples can you

157
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,860
imagine a completely impartial and

158
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,539
independent means of communication a

159
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,099
means of communication that doesn't

160
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,960
respond to political pressures we're

161
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,089
talking about media operated by a Dao

162
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,279
which would have no human onus you could

163
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,289
be tempted to push the editorial line

164
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:09,330
towards their own interests this company

165
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,949
which would be owned by a few lines of

166
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,150
code in the cloud with higher

167
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,159
journalists to work for it writing on

168
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:14,999
different topics

169
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,620
the topics with more hits would gain

170
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,539
more advertising revenue that is they

171
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,610
would give more money to the dao in

172
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,899
return it would provide greater

173
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,849
resources to hire more journalists and

174
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,770
improve the income of those who had the

175
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,839
most success and all of this it would be

176
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,490
run entirely independently

177
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,020
[Music]

178
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,700
how about another example imagine your

179
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,889
taxi is a self-driving car a car without

180
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,980
a driver its owner is the car itself and

181
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,690
it's code in the cloud throughout the

182
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,520
day the vehicle provides taxi services

183
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,290
to anyone who wants them and it's paid

184
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,060
in bitcoins and then at night it

185
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,340
refueled and just maintains once it's

186
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,050
done all of that it returns to service

187
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,700
with the income that the vehicle obtains

188
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,650
it saves money to buy more self-driving

189
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,360
taxi since that's how its code is

190
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,460
programmed eventually it could have an

191
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,139
entire fleet of them this company isn't

192
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,210
directly controlled by any human it

193
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,160
doesn't need a bureaucratic structure it

194
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,900
would be very efficient and offer its

195
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,630
services and very reduced rates

196
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,760
and now another example think about an

197
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,710
insurance company controlled by a dao

198
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,870
with hardly any human intervention

199
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,350
[Music]

200
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,460
imagine that a country's farmers create

201
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,290
an insurance cooperative to protect

202
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,630
themselves from frost the DAO company

203
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,040
would automatically collect insurance

204
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,470
premiums from these farmers and if in

205
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,000
any part of the country there's a frost

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,620
at a certain time of the year that

207
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,450
damages the crops it would automatically

208
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,490
compensate the farmers by depositing

209
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,930
money in their accounts all right so now

210
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,190
we got to ask the question well what's

211
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,900
the point of all of this well among

212
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,280
other things it's to optimize the

213
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,470
productivity and efficiency with which

214
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,780
we perform several tasks imagine what

215
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,310
all of this could mean many services

216
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,470
they'd become much much cheaper and it's

217
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,120
blockchain that is making all of this

218
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,160
spectacular automation possible that's

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,190
not all let's take another leap let's

220
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,500
give these daos artificial intelligence

221
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,030
we could imagine investment funds

222
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,240
pension funds NGOs all without

223
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,410
bureaucracy we're talking about daos

224
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,150
that could hire human analysts and

225
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,620
programmers who would be able to make

226
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,330
their own decisions based on their

227
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,130
programming and their learning capacity

228
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,140
administrative tasks would disappear

229
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,000
almost completely and now maybe you can

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,310
imagine a town hall with no politicians

231
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,080
or councillors a town hall with very

232
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,820
simple rules that can communicate with

233
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,280
its neighbors it is constituted as a Dao

234
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,500
all of this is becoming possible in one

235
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,530
way or another

236
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,520
blockchain could radically change

237
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
society as we know it

238
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
many of the bureaucratic structures that

239
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,020
we use today they'll be completely

240
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,300
unnecessary so let's take a closer look

241
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:55,270
at that distributed and autonomous

242
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,810
governance folks societies models

243
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,850
they've evolved you see at the beginning

244
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,410
of time human beings we lived in

245
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,570
decentralized structures composed of a

246
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,390
few people these were called tribes this

247
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,490
posed an advantage everyone knew each

248
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,020
other if someone did something bad to

249
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,790
someone else they probably wouldn't get

250
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,910
away with it however we really started

251
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,320
developing agriculture and labor

252
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,660
techniques around 10,000 years ago this

253
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,670
led to large-scale food production which

254
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,470
caused the population to grow so much

255
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,230
that the tribe model stopped working in

256
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,060
order to coordinate these new societies

257
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,520
political elites emerged these were the

258
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,250
Chiefs overlords nobles Kings this later

259
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,230
led to the politician and official

260
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,730
controlled states that we all know today

261
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,250
well now thanks to globalization the

262
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,810
internet and blockchain we could be on

263
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,850
the verge of a new revolution not only

264
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,010
for the market as we've already seen but

265
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,540
also for political governance see the

266
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,520
problem with representative democracy is

267
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,080
that we've introduced a new middleman

268
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,000
the professional politician a figure

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
thus once it reaches power ends up

270
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,600
behaving like a pilfering old-style

271
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,880
elite so the question now becomes what

272
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:09,550
can blockchain contribute to all of this

273
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,110
well welcome to what is already known as

274
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,510
distributed democracy and new concepts

275
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,860
that could largely replace the

276
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,750
representative democracy that we know of

277
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,520
today in fact it's likely that by the

278
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,380
end of the century many politicians will

279
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,180
have been replaced by this new type of

280
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,770
governance we're talking about a system

281
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,470
based on large daos and smart contracts

282
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,330
individuals will have the option to join

283
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,220
these regardless of the territory where

284
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,080
they live

285
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,960
[Music]

286
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,790
with this new system we could all

287
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,680
participate directly or delegate

288
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,450
specific decisions for the most valued

289
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,490
prepared or most well reputed members

290
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,470
this would all work on clearly defined

291
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,660
democratic and equal rules that are

292
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,140
known by all this model would be

293
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,120
completely transparent and professional

294
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,440
politicians would be given a much

295
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,660
smaller workload that way we could also

296
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,030
end corruption and stop the way in which

297
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,860
many politicians manipulate the system

298
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,020
to their advantage the system would make

299
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,510
no allowance for partisan interests or

300
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,030
nationalism or any of these issues just

301
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,280
efficient public administrations that

302
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,240
get the job done

303
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,610
as with companies blockchain can help

304
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,619
end bureaucracy a problem that has been

305
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:19,360
with us for thousands of years but all

306
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,579
right so you might still be unconvinced

307
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:22,990
so here's a couple of questions for you

308
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,369
what do you think would happen if you

309
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:26,410
tried to pay for a hotel with a credit

310
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,540
card in 1800 or how would you explain

311
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,459
what the internet is to Napoleon in

312
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:31,959
short the future is often

313
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,819
incomprehensible in the present day but

314
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,319
this really could be the place we're

315
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,199
going so I hope you enjoyed that video

316
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,879
and just before we wrap up today let me

317
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,129
tell you a bit about Squarespace if

318
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,290
you've got an important message to share

319
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,119
you can do it with Squarespace maybe you

320
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,319
like me and you need a place of people

321
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,869
to find you on the web or finds what you

322
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,309
do I mean you're starting a new business

323
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,809
and you need to set up an online

324
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:55,389
presence or a store or something like

325
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,769
that well it's all possible with

326
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,629
Squarespace now on Squarespace it all

327
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,399
starts with a stunning template talk

328
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,540
mention what these things are called

329
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,339
before they call things like pursuit and

330
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,160
rice you know cool names cool templates

331
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,290
it's a great place to start or if you're

332
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,850
not into templates and you've got the

333
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,769
design skills where you can do it

334
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,240
yourself you don't have to start with a

335
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,369
template you can start from scratch and

336
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:16,720
make something that looks good I would

337
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
be completely incapable of doing that I

338
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,350
don't have design skills which is why I

339
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,779
like templates but if you do you can use

340
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,820
those design skills

341
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,899
squarespace make it super easy to make

342
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,790
something that looks amazing you can

343
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,860
also easily move over an existing domain

344
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,230
and if you posted a website elsewhere

345
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,790
before it's gonna be a good thing to

346
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,250
move over because it's all just easier

347
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,750
with Squarespace and once you've gone

348
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,040
through the super easy customization

349
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
process there's no updates there's no

350
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,360
patches there's no tech BS that you have

351
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,140
to deal with

352
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,880
no one likes any of that stuff but you

353
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,079
know what everyone does like that would

354
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,600
be 24/7 support that Squarespace

355
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,709
offers they're there to help you

356

whenever you've got a question then

357
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,769
Squarespace it's not just about an

358
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,240
online presence like I said if you're

359
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,680
starting a business and you want to sell

360
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,899
online Squarespace is a great place to
