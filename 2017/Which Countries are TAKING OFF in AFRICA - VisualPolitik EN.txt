2
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.969
it's hard to put aside two thoughts when

3
00:00:09.9 --> 00:00:13.950
thinking about Africa the first is the

4
00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.260
thing that Africa is a continent forever

5
00:00:13.95 --> 00:00:18.930
sentence to poverty illness starvation

6
00:00:16.26 --> 00:00:20.520
and tragedy and a loss of tragedy so the

7
00:00:18.93 --> 00:00:22.800
Africa is often thought of as a somewhat

8
00:00:20.52 --> 00:00:23.580
compact territory when everything is

9
00:00:22.8 --> 00:00:25.590
connected

10
00:00:23.58 --> 00:00:27.660
so westernized Africa can look more like

11
00:00:25.59 --> 00:00:30.449
a country than a continent with many

12
00:00:27.66 --> 00:00:32.820
failing to realize the colossal size of

13
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.079
this continent Africa is as big as

14
00:00:32.82 --> 00:00:38.760
Europe the US India China and Argentina

15
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.520
combined so now you can imagine the

16
00:00:38.76 --> 00:00:43.170
diversity that this huge territory must

17
00:00:41.52 --> 00:00:45.300
contain the announcement centers the

18
00:00:43.17 --> 00:00:48.149
economists referred to Africa and the

19
00:00:45.3 --> 00:00:50.579
continent without us as can often happen

20
00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.710
things that rapidly changed in Africa

21
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.230
since the start of the 21st century

22
00:00:52.71 --> 00:00:56.969
Africa has experienced a significant

23
00:00:55.23 --> 00:00:58.620
boost especially in the poorest

24
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.960
countries on the continent with the

25
00:00:58.62 --> 00:01:02.820
exception of South Africa the countries

26
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:05.640
of sub-saharan Africa achieved annual

27
00:01:02.82 --> 00:01:07.650
growth rates of 6.2 percent by

28
00:01:05.64 --> 00:01:09.720
comparison that is twice the growth rate

29
00:01:07.65 --> 00:01:12.330
of countries in Latin America during the

30
00:01:09.72 --> 00:01:14.369
same time period in 2015

31
00:01:12.33 --> 00:01:16.590
five of the ten economies that grew the

32
00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.850
most in the world we're in Africa these

33
00:01:16.59 --> 00:01:23.220
are the Ivory Coast Ethiopia Tanzania

34
00:01:19.85 --> 00:01:25.619
Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of

35
00:01:23.22 --> 00:01:28.170
Congo the growth rate of these countries

36
00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.850
exceeded seven percent the Democratic

37
00:01:28.17 --> 00:01:31.829
Republic of Congo is being ranked among

38
00:01:29.85 --> 00:01:34.799
the top ten countries for reforms in the

39
00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.320
world for example in 2014 there are

40
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.180
already nearly 7,000 enterprises that

41
00:01:37.32 --> 00:01:40.920
have been created although the growth

42
00:01:39.18 --> 00:01:43.890
figures were a bit smaller the situation

43
00:01:40.92 --> 00:01:45.420
remains similar in the year 2016 all of

44
00:01:43.89 --> 00:01:47.520
this growth has led to some really

45
00:01:45.42 --> 00:01:48.869
significant social consequences so let's

46
00:01:47.52 --> 00:01:50.450
have a look at some of these for one

47
00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.290
life expectancy has increased

48
00:01:50.45 --> 00:01:54.149
significantly over the last eight years

49
00:01:52.29 --> 00:01:56.579
and child mortality figures and those

50
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.219
dying from starvation has been cut in

51
00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.820
half the summer extreme poverty used to

52
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.509
affect 58% of the population in 1999 and

53
00:02:02.82 --> 00:02:08.670
now it has decreased to just 35% it is

54
00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.649
still true that more than 420 million

55
00:02:08.67 --> 00:02:13.050
people are still suffering from extreme

56
00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.760
poverty in Africa which is tragic but

57
00:02:13.05 --> 00:02:16.830
fortunately the future is looking

58
00:02:14.76 --> 00:02:19.290
brighter than ever another thing is also

59
00:02:16.83 --> 00:02:21.780
certain Africa is going to have a major

60
00:02:19.29 --> 00:02:24.360
global role in the coming decades and

61
00:02:21.78 --> 00:02:27.090
it's middle-class or consumer class is

62
00:02:24.36 --> 00:02:30.720
the fastest growing in the world the

63
00:02:27.09 --> 00:02:33.690
fact is Africa is no longer emerging it

64
00:02:30.72 --> 00:02:35.280
is here now Africa is being urbanized

65
00:02:33.69 --> 00:02:37.140
quickly which allows for both the

66
00:02:35.28 --> 00:02:39.540
provision of public services and also

67
00:02:37.14 --> 00:02:41.370
economies of scale in the near future

68
00:02:39.54 --> 00:02:45.860
we are going to find many of the world's

69
00:02:41.37 --> 00:02:45.860
biggest cities are on this continent

70
00:02:47.22 --> 00:02:51.720
and you know Lagos Nigeria your Acura

71
00:02:49.77 --> 00:02:54.150
might become the new Shanghai in just a

72
00:02:51.72 --> 00:02:56.160
few short decade for example the tallest

73
00:02:54.15 --> 00:02:57.930
skyscraper in Africa the hack towers

74
00:02:56.16 --> 00:02:59.910
currently being built in Nairobi in

75
00:02:57.93 --> 00:03:02.070
Accra the capital city of Ghana six

76
00:02:59.91 --> 00:03:04.320
walls have been built in only six years

77
00:03:02.07 --> 00:03:05.790
and while that might not seem like a lot

78
00:03:04.32 --> 00:03:08.280
when you consider that there was only

79
00:03:05.79 --> 00:03:10.440
one mall in the entire city before those

80
00:03:08.28 --> 00:03:12.390
six new ones were built it seems like a

81
00:03:10.44 --> 00:03:13.920
little bit more foreign investments has

82
00:03:12.39 --> 00:03:15.420
also grown strongly in the last few

83
00:03:13.92 --> 00:03:17.220
years and half of these investments

84
00:03:15.42 --> 00:03:19.410
operate in areas that have nothing to do

85
00:03:17.22 --> 00:03:20.910
with Africa's natural resources this is

86
00:03:19.41 --> 00:03:22.260
important because many of the countries

87
00:03:20.91 --> 00:03:24.450
in Africa are trying to develop

88
00:03:22.26 --> 00:03:26.430
industries outside of raw materials so

89
00:03:24.45 --> 00:03:28.740
they are depending less on these natural

90
00:03:26.43 --> 00:03:35.480
resources these economies are known as

91
00:03:28.74 --> 00:03:38.250
the African lions the apps become lions

92
00:03:35.48 --> 00:03:41.250
these African lions include Kenya Uganda

93
00:03:38.25 --> 00:03:42.600
Tanzania and Mozambique and Zambia these

94
00:03:41.25 --> 00:03:44.550
are the countries in Africa that are

95
00:03:42.6 --> 00:03:46.440
developing the fastest now we're going

96
00:03:44.55 --> 00:03:48.180
to discuss each of them in detail in

97
00:03:46.44 --> 00:03:53.160
upcoming videos but today we're just

98
00:03:48.18 --> 00:03:55.020
going to focus on three of them one this

99
00:03:53.16 --> 00:03:56.820
is a small country with a population of

100
00:03:55.02 --> 00:03:58.680
only 12 million people and it doesn't

101
00:03:56.82 --> 00:04:00.480
have any coastline it is still a poor

102
00:03:58.68 --> 00:04:02.790
country but it is registered and almost

103
00:04:00.48 --> 00:04:05.940
9 percent annual growth since the year

104
00:04:02.79 --> 00:04:08.700
2001 and importantly this country has no

105
00:04:05.94 --> 00:04:10.920
oil or other important natural resources

106
00:04:08.7 --> 00:04:11.340
so the big question is well how do they

107
00:04:10.92 --> 00:04:13.320
do it

108
00:04:11.34 --> 00:04:15.450
this has actually been mostly down to

109
00:04:13.32 --> 00:04:17.459
supporting business creation this is why

110
00:04:15.45 --> 00:04:19.290
Rwanda is the second easiest country to

111
00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.030
do business in in sub-saharan Africa

112
00:04:19.29 --> 00:04:22.740
according to the World Bank doing

113
00:04:21.03 --> 00:04:24.210
business report so the question you

114
00:04:22.74 --> 00:04:26.550
might be asking is this is a coincidence

115
00:04:24.21 --> 00:04:28.650
and we have visual politics we really

116
00:04:26.55 --> 00:04:30.330
don't think so we are now for example

117
00:04:28.65 --> 00:04:32.550
looking at the secondary cities the

118
00:04:30.33 --> 00:04:34.110
cities if they were organized if they

119
00:04:32.55 --> 00:04:35.580
were visited and you put everything

120
00:04:34.11 --> 00:04:38.640
that's needed and he's a little

121
00:04:35.58 --> 00:04:40.650
connected the portable growth now thanks

122
00:04:38.64 --> 00:04:42.900
to all of this nearly all children have

123
00:04:40.65 --> 00:04:44.669
primary education and the 98 percent of

124
00:04:42.9 --> 00:04:46.350
its people already have access to health

125
00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.380
care as a consequence child mortality

126
00:04:46.35 --> 00:04:51.960
has been reduced by 60 percent and AIDS

127
00:04:49.38 --> 00:04:54.270
and malaria have also seen significant

128
00:04:51.96 --> 00:04:56.400
reductions further Rwanda spreadin Paul

129
00:04:54.27 --> 00:04:58.440
Kagame claims to be a disciple of Lee

130
00:04:56.4 --> 00:04:59.520
Kuan Yew the legendary leader of

131
00:04:58.44 --> 00:05:00.120
Singapore here we're going to be

132
00:04:59.52 --> 00:05:01.740
discussing

133
00:05:00.12 --> 00:05:03.150
an upcoming episode so don't forget to

134
00:05:01.74 --> 00:05:04.560
subscribe if you haven't already so you

135
00:05:03.15 --> 00:05:06.240
were getting notified about that and

136
00:05:04.56 --> 00:05:07.760
also won't miss out on any of our other

137
00:05:06.24 --> 00:05:12.449
videos

138
00:05:07.76 --> 00:05:14.940
Ethiopia this is a much larger country

139
00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.580
with a population of nearly 100 million

140
00:05:14.94 --> 00:05:19.590
people in Ethiopia around 20 million

141
00:05:17.58 --> 00:05:20.910
people still have nutritional problems

142
00:05:19.59 --> 00:05:22.350
and that is not the only problem they

143
00:05:20.91 --> 00:05:24.330
have the government's also become more

144
00:05:22.35 --> 00:05:25.710
authoritarian recently however things

145
00:05:24.33 --> 00:05:28.530
are changing faster than today

146
00:05:25.71 --> 00:05:30.090
Ethiopia's capital addis ababa is always

147
00:05:28.53 --> 00:05:32.430
pursuing significant construction

148
00:05:30.09 --> 00:05:34.320
project in fact about a year ago at a

149
00:05:32.43 --> 00:05:36.360
salad bar opens the first modern tram

150
00:05:34.32 --> 00:05:38.430
system in all of sub-saharan Africa and

151
00:05:36.36 --> 00:05:39.600
to be honest they deserve it if the Opia

152
00:05:38.43 --> 00:05:41.699
is a country which has grown

153
00:05:39.6 --> 00:05:44.039
significantly in the last 10 years its

154
00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.410
economy is multiplied by a factor of 5

155
00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.510
in this period and its GDP has grown by

156
00:05:46.41 --> 00:05:51.449
over 10 percent every year

157
00:05:48.51 --> 00:05:54.630
tomah's very colorful run run run run

158
00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.060
run run in Busan so now you might be

159
00:05:54.63 --> 00:05:58.590
asking well how did they do it well they

160
00:05:57.06 --> 00:06:00.300
were simply trying to be more attractive

161
00:05:58.59 --> 00:06:02.280
to investors it's in their neighboring

162
00:06:00.3 --> 00:06:04.740
country in doing so the country has

163
00:06:02.28 --> 00:06:07.169
established two main priorities one

164
00:06:04.74 --> 00:06:09.330
achieved stable macroeconomics and to

165
00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.950
establish attractive taxation for

166
00:06:09.33 --> 00:06:12.690
example import of technological

167
00:06:10.95 --> 00:06:15.150
equipment such as machinery does not

168
00:06:12.69 --> 00:06:16.889
have any import charge further companies

169
00:06:15.15 --> 00:06:22.550
don't have any tags in their first 5

170
00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.550
years which is pretty nice but planner

171
00:06:23.1 --> 00:06:27.400
so we couldn't do this video without

172
00:06:25.42 --> 00:06:30.310
mentioning Botswana the country which

173
00:06:27.4 --> 00:06:32.320
recently celebrated in 2016 the 50th

174
00:06:30.31 --> 00:06:34.600
anniversary of its independence what

175
00:06:32.32 --> 00:06:36.790
SWANA has been the greatest economic

176
00:06:34.6 --> 00:06:38.200
success story in all of Africa in fact

177
00:06:36.79 --> 00:06:40.510
it is even one of the most successful

178
00:06:38.2 --> 00:06:43.330
worldwide at the time of Botswana

179
00:06:40.51 --> 00:06:45.160
independence in the year 1966 it was one

180
00:06:43.33 --> 00:06:47.020
of the poorest countries on the planet

181
00:06:45.16 --> 00:06:48.760
on top of that the country has suffered

182
00:06:47.02 --> 00:06:51.070
severe droughts and has suffered from

183
00:06:48.76 --> 00:06:53.410
the second largest AIDS epidemic in the

184
00:06:51.07 --> 00:06:55.210
world in spite of all these obstacles

185
00:06:53.41 --> 00:06:57.280
the country has experienced development

186
00:06:55.21 --> 00:06:58.900
so significant that its GDP in

187
00:06:57.28 --> 00:07:00.730
purchasing power pariah tea is

188
00:06:58.9 --> 00:07:03.520
equivalent to countries such as Colombia

189
00:07:00.73 --> 00:07:04.780
Brazil or Thailand this is obviously

190
00:07:03.52 --> 00:07:07.530
considering the different levels of

191
00:07:04.78 --> 00:07:11.440
prices among these countries

192
00:07:07.53 --> 00:07:14.170
[Music]

193
00:07:11.44 --> 00:07:15.640
here the key to success can be found in

194
00:07:14.17 --> 00:07:17.410
these strengths of its national

195
00:07:15.64 --> 00:07:19.870
institutions their healthy public

196
00:07:17.41 --> 00:07:22.300
finances and above all the country's

197
00:07:19.87 --> 00:07:24.340
legal certainty in fact in the last CPI

198
00:07:22.3 --> 00:07:26.680
corruption perception index for SWANA

199
00:07:24.34 --> 00:07:28.060
was ranked since 31st position this is a

200
00:07:26.68 --> 00:07:31.560
better position than countries like

201
00:07:28.06 --> 00:07:35.650
Spain Israel or Taiwan rule of law

202
00:07:31.56 --> 00:07:37.390
regulatory reform good governance those

203
00:07:35.65 --> 00:07:39.400
things matter even more because people

204
00:07:37.39 --> 00:07:40.840
should be able to start a business and

205
00:07:39.4 --> 00:07:43.000
ship their goods without having to pay a

206
00:07:40.84 --> 00:07:45.070
bribe or hire somebody's cousin but now

207
00:07:43.0 --> 00:07:46.810
how about some more surprising facts

208
00:07:45.07 --> 00:07:49.450
about Africa you should know that this

209
00:07:46.81 --> 00:07:51.670
continent is already home to 400

210
00:07:49.45 --> 00:07:54.070
companies with a turnover of more than a

211
00:07:51.67 --> 00:07:55.750
billion dollars a year so it really does

212
00:07:54.07 --> 00:07:58.060
seem that the end of Africa being a

213
00:07:55.75 --> 00:07:59.860
totally poor continent is coming to an

214
00:07:58.06 --> 00:08:02.050
end furthermore in Africa we can also

215
00:07:59.86 --> 00:08:04.120
find Nollywood the second largest film

216
00:08:02.05 --> 00:08:05.770
industry in terms of films produced in

217
00:08:04.12 --> 00:08:07.750
the world only two thousand five hundred

218
00:08:05.77 --> 00:08:10.210
films less than Bollywood so that in

219
00:08:07.75 --> 00:08:16.630
Nigeria loans the film industry employs

220
00:08:10.21 --> 00:08:18.760
around a million workers am I and now

221
00:08:16.63 --> 00:08:21.310
for just one final surprise Africa is

222
00:08:18.76 --> 00:08:23.770
the world leader in online banking and

223
00:08:21.31 --> 00:08:25.150
mobile phone payments yes you probably

224
00:08:23.77 --> 00:08:27.669
weren't expecting that but it is

225
00:08:25.15 --> 00:08:29.169
absolutely true today many farmers share

226
00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:31.030
information through SMS and in the

227
00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:33.640
strengths of Rwanda it is popular to use

228
00:08:31.03 --> 00:08:35.560
safemotos which is like a Rwandan

229
00:08:33.64 --> 00:08:37.690
version of either except this is more

230
00:08:35.56 --> 00:08:39.370
different instead of using cars they use

231
00:08:37.69 --> 00:08:41.380
motorcycles because there are very few

232
00:08:39.37 --> 00:08:43.570
cars available so the thing about Africa

233
00:08:41.38 --> 00:08:45.490
is that it is changing incredibly fast

234
00:08:43.57 --> 00:08:48.010
but the truth is that there are still

235
00:08:45.49 --> 00:08:49.810
many challenges and difficulties that

236
00:08:48.01 --> 00:08:51.640
the continent is going to face ahead for

237
00:08:49.81 --> 00:08:53.530
example consolidating the rule of law

238
00:08:51.64 --> 00:08:55.120
reducing poverty and improving their

239
00:08:53.53 --> 00:08:56.800
infrastructure and of course they need

240
00:08:55.12 --> 00:08:58.360
to put an end once and for all to all

241
00:08:56.8 --> 00:09:00.850
those terrible dictatorships in

242
00:08:58.36 --> 00:09:02.740
countries like Angola Eritrea or

243
00:09:00.85 --> 00:09:04.960
Equatorial Guinea however everything

244
00:09:02.74 --> 00:09:07.210
does seem to indicate that the future

245
00:09:04.96 --> 00:09:08.800
for Africa is brighter than it has ever

246
00:09:07.21 --> 00:09:10.390
been so I hope you found that video

247
00:09:08.8 --> 00:09:11.980
interesting and we would love to know

248

what you think do you think that Africa

249
00:09:11.98 --> 00:09:15.220
is going to become a major player in the

250
00:09:13.72 --> 00:09:16.690
coming decades student let us know in
