fumes they're everywhere they are the

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,030
latest problems in the spotlight and is

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,320
understandable because the health

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,329
effects of these problems are huge

14
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:42,860
they're linked to respiratory and

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,710
living in highly congested and polluted

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,839
cities can be harmful to us it's true

19
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:55,699
that cities have lots of advantages but

20
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,530
they can also pose very serious

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,049
inconveniences if they are not managed

22
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:04,009
correctly you see according to the World

23
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:06,140
Health Organization every year more than

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,240
4 million people in the world die due to

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
air pollution of course it's not all

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,380
from traffic industry and energy

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,780
production are also highly responsible

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,000
however traffic is the most worrying

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,920
source because we live with it it's all

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,840
around us every day it's in this streets

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,970
we walk down it's by our apartment

32
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,540
buildings it's just everywhere and it

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,610
follows logically that says the urban

34
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,800
population grows so does the number of

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,600
cars circulating the problem it just

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,940
keeps getting bigger and bigger this is

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,580
especially true in the large metropolis

38
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,370
of developing countries take for example

39
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:46,970
Mexico

40
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,590
since the 1900s the number of cars in

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,050
Mexican cities has almost quadrupled now

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,720
this doesn't only happen there not at

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,560
all in fact it's a global trends in

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,510
recent decades both the population in

45
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,550
the number of vehicles in cities has

46
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,520
skyrocketed but now politics has finally

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,290
turned its attention towards this

48
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,920
problem London Madrid Beijing Singapore

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,290
New York more and more cities across the

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,180
globe are implementing measures to limit

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,400
traffic and improve the air quality and

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,440
habitability of their cities and with

53
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,900
improved cities of course comes improved

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,700
we're talking about restrictions that

57
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,190
aim to balance the coexistence of cars

58
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,230
and people but now what are these

59
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,510
restrictions involve are they all the

60
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,850
same or are some models more effective

61
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,770
than others for reducing traffic and

62
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,050
improving cities also what strategies

63
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,180
have seen the most success well let's

liberal or conservative politicians of

all kinds are implementing strategies to

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,950
reduce traffic in cities but not all

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,460
measures are equal not at all there's a

74
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,220
huge inventory of restrictions of all

with everything without looking any

83
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,720
further than Europe one city has become

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120

capital is already world famous for

92
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,830
having launched one of the most

93
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,140
restrictive car policies in it's city

94
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,480
center named Central Madrid the city has

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,220
prohibited old vehicles that don't have

96
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,810
an environmental label issued by the

97
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,489
general traffic Directorate from

98
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,140
accessing a large part of the urban

99
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,239
center and not only that unless you live

100
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:14,860
in the center itself even if your car

101
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,900
has an environmental label if it isn't

102
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,370
hybrid or electric

103
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,560
you'll only gain limited access to the

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,250
center however this system has three

105
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,880
main drawbacks first it's a very rigid

106
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,830
system limiting the use of vehicles

107
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,660
regardless of why they want to access

108
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,090
the area could have undesirable economic

109
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,620
effects for example imagine that a

110
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,540
person with a not-so-new car wants to

111
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,880
access the area to visit an office and

112
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,590
do some paperwork he simply wouldn't be

113
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,550
able to

114
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,810
seconds in the long term it doesn't

115
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,880
really solve the traffic problem as the

116
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,100
car park fills with hybrid cars which

117
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,810
seems to be happening traffic problems

118
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,210
will return and thirdly it doesn't tax

119
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,250
the negative externality of pollution or

120
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,080
generate resources for the City Council

121
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,720
to invest in alternatives such as public

122
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,670
transport to avoid all of these

123
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,890
inconveniences London the city with the

124
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,750
worst air in Europe has opted for what

125
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,330
is known as a congestion fee it consists

126
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,130
basically of making you pay a specific

127
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,230
amount to ends at the restricted central

128
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,360
area Milan does something similar where

129
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
even the residents have to pay to enter

130
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,230
Zone C yes you had that right you need

131
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,330
to pay to be able to drive your car to

132
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,790
your own home but hold on a second even

133
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,930
though Europe is the most car

134
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,640
restrictive continent restrictions

135
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,530
aren't only a European matter let's

136
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,810
cross the ponds and visit New York the

137
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,110
Big Apple in Manhattan a congestion fees

138
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,970
system is about to be implements and

139
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,830
it's generating a lot of torque it

140
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,660
should be ready by 2021 and it could

141
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,430
change New York forever yes the heart of

142
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,170
the Big Apple is one of the most vibrant

143
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,940
and busy places in the world but it's

144
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,220
also one of the most congested and noisy

145
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,990
due to traffic now this new regulation

146
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,740
it could change all of that as you can

147
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,419
see this new regulation will affect a

148
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:06,430
very very large area which extends from

149
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,800
Battery Park to Central Park can you

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,930
imagine just half of Fifth Avenue being

151
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,640
empty but how much will it cost to enter

152
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,110
well folks it hasn't been set yet but

153
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,460
it's believed is going to be in between

154
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,220
10 and 15 dollars per entry question is

155
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,840
now is it gonna work

158
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,250
sure absolutely but to limit pollution

159
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,860
and congestion many times going to tell

160
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,660
but currently people have their doubts

161
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,729
first because of the United States is

162
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,289
car culture and because of all the

163
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,639
problems that the public transport

164
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,889
system has in the city and secondly

165
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,900
because just with taxis uber vehicles

166
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,340
and the average income of Manhattan

167
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,320
drivers results may not be very

168
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,150
promising I guess it'll all depends on

169
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:58,080
how large or small the toll will be but

170
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,310
the United States is not the only

171
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,590
country which has a deep-rooted car

172
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,780
culture the Chinese who have terrible

173
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,789
pollution also love to get around by car

174
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,110
and this has led to the implementation

175
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,270
of rather restrictive measures some of

176
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,229
which are really rather curious for

177
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,449
example the shanghai china's economic

178
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,430
capital we're talking about a place that

179
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,320
has quickly become a large city full of

180
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,560
office and residential skyscrapers and

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,990
of course this economic boom has led to

182
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,240
a huge explosion in car sales this is a

183
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,860
phenomenon that has spread throughout

184
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,370
the rest of china the facts is that to

185
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,320
limit traffic and curb congestion and

186
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,580
pollution in shanghai they have

187
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,070
established a system of monthly license

188
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,800
plate auctions the system has been

189
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,780
enforced since the year 2000 and the

190
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,550
truth is the results aren't that bad

191
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,180
of course as license plates are limited

192
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,099
to prevent an exorbitant increase in the

193
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,599
number of vehicles it can usually be

194
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,729
priced around fifteen thousand dollars

195
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,949
often being more expensive than the cars

196
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,720
being registered so why are they so

197
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,490
expensive well there's only one

198
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,500
explanation yes that is really hard to

199
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,280
get one for example in one of the

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,349
wildest auctions six thousand four

201
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,000
hundred and sixty license plates were

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,240
offered and 2.8 million people bid for

203
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,770
them it's almost easier to win the

204
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,599
lottery and speaking of lotteries in the

205
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,190
Chinese capital Beijing they have

206
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,229
established an actual license plate

207
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:22,740
lottery see where this lottery system

208
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,090
the city offers a certain number of

209
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,159
license plates every year and gives them

210
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,349
out randomly and for free licenses are

211
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,900
in theory non-transferable but in

212
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,070
practice a huge black market has emerged

213
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,839
the system is peculiar because it

214
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,430
doesn't generate economic benefits for

215
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,560
the City Council as it does in Shanghai

216
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,120
which uses the money obtained in the

217
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,979
auctions to improve roads or public

218
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,930
transport for its Bart Guangzhou wins

219
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,700
three other major Chinese cities have

220
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,829
opted for a hybrid model one part is

221
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,650
auctions and another is drawn basically

222
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,990
different cities have different models

223
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,860
[Music]

224
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,970
but at this point you might be wondering

225
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,040
out of all of these measures which one

226
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,230
is the most appropriate which is the

227
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,760
most effective and four which should be

228
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,230
bet on well I'm sorry to say that

229
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,300
there's no exact answer because it

230
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,550
depends on each case now one place has

231
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,930
combined several measures and it seems

232
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:19,540
to be doing really rather well

233
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,980
Singapore supply-and-demand

234
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,439
[Music]

235
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,420
you heard that right this microstate of

236
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,829
which we've already spoken in another

237
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,230
video has done things differently how

238
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,509
well the secret lies in the congestion

239
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,459
fee and you might be thinking well we

240
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,079
already talked about that in London's

241
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,420
case and also in the case of New York

242
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,060
and yes that's true but Singapore's rate

243
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,839
is different allow me to explain

244
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,149
Singapore has an electronic toll network

245
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,850
called ERP this network monitors traffic

246
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,699
and attentively this is the key it sets

247
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,439
the price of tolls based on traffic

248
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,420
congestion it's like a supply and demand

249
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,399
system the supply is the roads of

250
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,199
Singapore and the demand is traffic the

251
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,819
more drivers there are circulating the

252
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,170
city the more expensive the rate is

253
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,029
going to be therefore prices change

254
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,220
every hour and every half hour becoming

255
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,139
more expensive during peak hours it

256
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:12,889
makes a lot of sense right the system

257
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:14,750
discourages the use of private vehicles

258
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,000
traveling without arbitrarily limiting

259
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,589
the number of vehicles if you want to

260
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,540
pay you are free to go

261
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,160
thus traffic is regulated and congestion

262
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,050
is avoided through a price system

263
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,610
because and this is important traffic

264
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,279
jams have a huge economic cost on cities

265
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,079
a cost that goes far beyond pollution

266
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:35,240
itself and goes into things like delays

267
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,870
lost productivity stress etc but here's

268
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,759
a key question where does all the money

269
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:45,310
raised with these dynamic tolls go

270
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,079
well this is where it gets quite

271
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,699
interesting its reinvested in

272
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,410
Singapore's public transport system

273
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,600
which is already excellence in fact it's

274
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,319
one of the best in the world which if

275
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,639
you think about it leads to a double

276
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,529
disincentive to use the car you have to

277
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,389
pay and you also have an increasingly

278
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,249
better public transport system but

279
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,529
really how effective is this system how

280
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,540
has the congestion fee affected

281
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,009
Singapore's traffic but let's have a

282
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:13,490
look at some data

283
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,800
check this out the airless manual system

284
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,860
was implemented in 1975 and it's the

285
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,470
precursor to the ERP the system required

286
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,029
you to pay for accreditation to

287
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,100
circulate in the restricted area it was

288
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,259
a success and it decreased traffic by 44

289
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:29,029
percent during operational hours this

290
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,709
was much more than the initially plans

291
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,749
30 percent so yes really quite the

292
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:36,319
success it is due to the ascent

293
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,819
unsurprisingly due to technological

294
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,499
advances that Singaporean authorities

295
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,019
launched the current ERP system the

296
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:45,090
automated system which happens in 1998

297
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,209
[Music]

298
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,410
traffic in Singapore's business centre

299
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,910
during business hours has dropped even

300
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,110
more like 10 to 15 percent that's not

301
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,879
all additionally another measure is

302
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,470
applied in Singapore that may seem

303
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,179
controversial and leaves some a bit

304
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,369
speechless there's a 100 percent

305
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,920
surcharge or even more just to register

306
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,170
ones vehicle basically registering your

307
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,809
car can cost the same or more than the

308
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,329
car itself this of course discourages a

309
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:15,649
lot of car purchases obviously this is a

310
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,689
lot to do with the idiosyncrasies of the

311
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:20,170
place itself Singapore is a city-state

312
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,160
anyway as you can see from this video

313
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,420
there are a lot of different ways that

314
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,699
cities experiment with reducing number

315
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:27,319
of cars in their centres but now it's

316
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:29,360
your turn which model do you prefer is

317
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,189
it arbitrary limitation or discouraging

318
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:33,350
car use by hitting drivers pockets maybe

319
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,569
refer traffic based systems or variable

320
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:37,189
rates unlimited registrations or

321
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,079
auctions and lotteries but more

322
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,459
important than answering that question

323
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,949
is protecting yourself with a VPN and

324
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:46,929
that's where Nord VPN comes in

325
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,549
you haven't sit in a cafe with some open

326
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:51,019
Wi-Fi network and wanted to check your

327
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,670
internet banking or something like that

328
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,779
well don't even think about it with a

329
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,819
VPN because well you're just opening

330
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:58,339
yourself up to a whole bunch of problems

331
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,279
so or maybe you're a theoretical British

332
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,740
man living abroad and you're like gosh I

333
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,839
sure would love away to watch British

334
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,910
stuff while in that foreign country

335
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,459
well more VPN sorts that theoretical

336
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,319
person out they make content available

337
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,850
from one country available everywhere

338
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,129
Nord VPN is super fast so watching your

339
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,660
video is a breeze there's no lag

340
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,879
whatsoever if you've ever used VPNs and

341
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,980
thought they were slow well no more with

342
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,749
Nord VPN but you can use it on all your

343
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,819
devices very very easily also works on

344
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,129
Android Chrome Windows Linux and you can

345
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,079
use it on six of your devices with just

346
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,180
one account and I think if I even I've

347
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,230
got six devices also there are no logs

348
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,059
kept like other companies based in the

349
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,939
EU or the u.s. Panama is where Nord VPN

350
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,559
is base are they'll have to keep logs at

351
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,759
all that's nice

352
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,069
indeed Nord VPN is the only VPN to get a

353
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:48,439
perfect score from PC Mag Nord VPN is
