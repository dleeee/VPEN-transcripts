3
00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.340
have you ever asked yourself which is

4
00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.019
the best country to live in

5
00:00:11.34 --> 00:00:14.580
well when we want to know which country

6
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.490
that is we usually tend to look at the

7
00:00:14.58 --> 00:00:19.650
country's GDP but however important and

8
00:00:17.49 --> 00:00:21.930
relevant this indicator might be it does

9
00:00:19.65 --> 00:00:24.390
have certain limitations see this

10
00:00:21.93 --> 00:00:26.939
statistic is too wide and it can hide

11
00:00:24.39 --> 00:00:29.369
the influence of bubbles the actions of

12
00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.900
dishonest politicians and more complex

13
00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.940
issues like accounting for the online

14
00:00:30.9 --> 00:00:35.130
economy it is true though that wealth

15
00:00:32.94 --> 00:00:37.469
and comfort are closely related to the

16
00:00:35.13 --> 00:00:39.660
GDP that it is not an exact correlation

17
00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
let me explain we could be analyzing a

18
00:00:39.66 --> 00:00:43.739
country that has a higher GDP per capita

19
00:00:41.43 --> 00:00:45.690
than another but the Lasser could have a

20
00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.300
better welfare system despite having

21
00:00:45.69 --> 00:00:50.219
that lower GDP

22
00:00:48.3 --> 00:00:51.600
and there are also other factors to

23
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.180
consider that are not strictly economic

24
00:00:51.6 --> 00:00:56.579
but also affect the social well-being of

25
00:00:54.18 --> 00:00:57.660
people such as security and freedom all

26
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.070
right all right so I probably know where

27
00:00:57.66 --> 00:01:00.600
some of you are thinking right now and

28
00:00:59.07 --> 00:01:02.760
that's that well don't these things all

29
00:01:00.6 --> 00:01:04.890
result from having a higher GDP anyway

30
00:01:02.76 --> 00:01:06.690
well yeah they kind of do but it usually

31
00:01:04.89 --> 00:01:08.820
takes a while before any of this can be

32
00:01:06.69 --> 00:01:11.159
seen in terms of numbers and statistics

33
00:01:08.82 --> 00:01:12.600
for instance if you look at Kuwait GDP

34
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.700
per capita it's definitely higher than

35
00:01:12.6 --> 00:01:16.440
Germany's foot if given the choice most

36
00:01:14.7 --> 00:01:20.940
people would probably rather live in the

37
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:22.080
latter it's also more likely that

38
00:01:20.94 --> 00:01:23.970
Germany is going to be involved in

39
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:26.520
complex and high added value activities

40
00:01:23.97 --> 00:01:28.619
like creating patents and innovative

41
00:01:26.52 --> 00:01:29.970
companies in other words q8 that might

42
00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.830
become richer but at the same time

43
00:01:29.97 --> 00:01:33.539
Germany might be taking better advantage

44
00:01:31.83 --> 00:01:35.910
of its wealth in order to produce

45
00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.950
welfare sustainable wealth technology

46
00:01:35.91 --> 00:01:39.929
and knowledge and most people would

47
00:01:37.95 --> 00:01:41.520
regard doing that as a pretty sensible

48
00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.080
decision and this whole complicated

49
00:01:41.52 --> 00:01:44.940
thing that's why there are new

50
00:01:43.08 --> 00:01:46.950
indicators to try to make a more

51
00:01:44.94 --> 00:01:49.200
accurate approximation so that we can

52
00:01:46.95 --> 00:01:50.970
work out the prosperity and comfort of

53
00:01:49.2 --> 00:01:53.119
different nations one of them is the

54
00:01:50.97 --> 00:01:55.500
famous Lagarde and prosperity index

55
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.599
national success is about far more than

56
00:01:55.5 --> 00:02:00.000
just GDP it is about a healthy and happy

57
00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.920
life a good education for our children a

58
00:02:00.0 --> 00:02:03.959
clean and protected environment family

59
00:02:01.92 --> 00:02:06.000
and communities we can rely on a safe

60
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.590
place to live opportunities to start a

61
00:02:06.0 --> 00:02:09.690
business or get ahead and the freedom to

62
00:02:07.59 --> 00:02:11.760
be who we want to be this is true

63
00:02:09.69 --> 00:02:13.260
prosperity and you know what's at least

64
00:02:11.76 --> 00:02:16.260
according to these rankings the most

65
00:02:13.26 --> 00:02:18.440
prosperous nation on earth is well that

66
00:02:16.26 --> 00:02:22.379
would be New Zealand's

67
00:02:18.44 --> 00:02:26.540
[Music]

68
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:29.269
the most prosperous country

69
00:02:26.54 --> 00:02:31.069
to try to get a deeper knowledge of the

70
00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.569
prosperity of a country beyond the GDP

71
00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.340
then the Gaussian prosperity index

72
00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.260
considers tons of different factors

73
00:02:34.34 --> 00:02:37.969
economics business civil liberties

74
00:02:36.26 --> 00:02:40.040
government education environments

75
00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.469
honestly every aspect that accounts for

76
00:02:40.04 --> 00:02:44.629
quality of life in a country so in the

77
00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.150
latest ranking the result it was pretty

78
00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.609
clear nowadays new zealand land of the

79
00:02:47.15 --> 00:02:51.980
Kiwi is the most prosperous country on

80
00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.689
the planet and honestly this wasn't

81
00:02:51.98 --> 00:02:56.000
really much of a surprise New Zealand

82
00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:00.159
has taken this position six times in the

83
00:02:56.0 --> 00:03:00.159
last ten years not bad right

84
00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.150
and now you might be wondering which are

85
00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.919
the countries New Zealand is competing

86
00:03:05.15 --> 00:03:08.930
with in order to win the crown of the

87
00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.129
best country on earth well you wouldn't

88
00:03:08.93 --> 00:03:11.870
be surprised to find at the top of the

89
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.359
list countries like Norway Finland

90
00:03:11.87 --> 00:03:16.099
Switzerland Canada or Australia it's

91
00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.930
pretty tough competition I should also

92
00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.400
mention at this point that soon enough

93
00:03:17.93 --> 00:03:21.560
we're going to be explaining on this

94
00:03:19.4 --> 00:03:23.780
channel how New Zealand achieved so much

95
00:03:21.56 --> 00:03:25.459
of this after so much crisis if you want

96
00:03:23.78 --> 00:03:27.169
to catch that video be sure to you

97
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.939
subscribe to this channel for now let's

98
00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.200
move on now if you think New Zealand is

99
00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.569
just ranked number one for this

100
00:03:30.2 --> 00:03:34.400
indicator well you couldn't be more

101
00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.530
wrong if we consider the doing business

102
00:03:34.4 --> 00:03:37.909
ranking for instance this is a ranking

103
00:03:36.53 --> 00:03:39.319
by the way that classifies countries

104
00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.150
according to how easy it is to set up

105
00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.459
company and do business we can see that

106
00:03:41.15 --> 00:03:46.459
New Zealand is also in the number one

107
00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.799
spot in the latest ranking New Zealand

108
00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.900
dethrones Singapore as easiest place to

109
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.280
do business if we use the index of

110
00:03:50.9 --> 00:03:54.049
economic freedom from the Heritage

111
00:03:52.28 --> 00:03:55.699
Foundation we will see that New Zealand

112
00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.129
is in third position right after

113
00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.900
Singapore and Hong Kong then if we use

114
00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.669
the ranking of the Fraser Institute a

115
00:03:59.9 --> 00:04:03.799
ranking that considers both economic and

116
00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.079
civil freedom New Zealand's is also in

117
00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.699
the top three just behind Hong Kong and

118
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.810
Switzerland and if this is not enough

119
00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.849
for you and you want more specific

120
00:04:08.81 --> 00:04:12.919
information I can also tell you that New

121
00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.290
Zealand is the least corrupt country on

122
00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.760
earth according to Transparency

123
00:04:14.29 --> 00:04:17.810
International this is a position that it

124
00:04:16.76 --> 00:04:19.430
shares with Denmark

125
00:04:17.81 --> 00:04:21.349
yes unlike other countries that we

126
00:04:19.43 --> 00:04:22.729
happen to know very well it is very

127
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.490
uncommon for this country's government

128
00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.720
to you have their hands in the till

129
00:04:24.49 --> 00:04:29.150
furthermore this is also one of the

130
00:04:26.72 --> 00:04:30.500
safest countries in the world as well as

131
00:04:29.15 --> 00:04:32.479
being one of the most environmentally

132
00:04:30.5 --> 00:04:34.460
friendly and it also has the All Blacks

133
00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.820
the best national rugby team on the

134
00:04:34.46 --> 00:04:36.820
planet

135
00:04:39.8 --> 00:04:43.710
but let's move on from the rankings

136
00:04:42.06 --> 00:04:45.810
because honestly we could go on forever

137
00:04:43.71 --> 00:04:47.520
they do seem to make one thing there

138
00:04:45.81 --> 00:04:49.200
though and that is that on paper New

139
00:04:47.52 --> 00:04:54.000
Zealand it sure does look like one of

140
00:04:49.2 --> 00:04:55.650
the best places in the world to live by

141
00:04:54.0 --> 00:04:58.200
the way here is a surprising facts about

142
00:04:55.65 --> 00:04:59.610
our Tharoor busy Senen Maori which is an

143
00:04:58.2 --> 00:05:01.320
official language there the New

144
00:04:59.61 --> 00:05:03.060
Zealanders are really proud of the Maori

145
00:05:01.32 --> 00:05:04.860
culture and the integration of these

146
00:05:03.06 --> 00:05:06.600
Polynesian people that the British found

147
00:05:04.86 --> 00:05:08.970
when they arrived on these islands it is

148
00:05:06.6 --> 00:05:13.680
true no matter where you go the Maori

149
00:05:08.97 --> 00:05:16.860
culture is present alright so moving on

150
00:05:13.68 --> 00:05:23.010
on the 23rd of September 2017 elections

151
00:05:16.86 --> 00:05:25.500
took place in this country a record

152
00:05:23.01 --> 00:05:27.300
election

153
00:05:25.5 --> 00:05:29.250
the first thing we need to remember is

154
00:05:27.3 --> 00:05:31.200
that New Zealand is a constitutional

155
00:05:29.25 --> 00:05:32.910
monarchy that's right elizabeth ii is

156
00:05:31.2 --> 00:05:35.370
still the queen of this country but it's

157
00:05:32.91 --> 00:05:37.530
really just a symbolic position god

158
00:05:35.37 --> 00:05:39.150
save green in new zealand the government

159
00:05:37.53 --> 00:05:41.190
is elected by the Parliament and the

160
00:05:39.15 --> 00:05:42.990
term lasts for three years

161
00:05:41.19 --> 00:05:45.030
further when New Zealanders go to vote

162
00:05:42.99 --> 00:05:47.070
they have to vote twice one of the votes

163
00:05:45.03 --> 00:05:48.810
goes to a single candidate from one

164
00:05:47.07 --> 00:05:50.460
political party this will complete a

165
00:05:48.81 --> 00:05:52.260
part of the Parliament the other vote

166
00:05:50.46 --> 00:05:54.300
goes to an MP who will represent their

167
00:05:52.26 --> 00:05:56.040
district so as we said on the 23rd of

168
00:05:54.3 --> 00:05:58.020
September New Zealand held an election

169
00:05:56.04 --> 00:06:00.540
and it was a clear victory for the

170
00:05:58.02 --> 00:06:05.590
National Party of Bill English

171
00:06:00.54 --> 00:06:07.910

00:06:05.59 --> 00:06:09.050
they'll English already was the Prime

173
00:06:07.91 --> 00:06:10.850
Minister by the way since the

174
00:06:09.05 --> 00:06:13.310
resignation of John Key in December of

175
00:06:10.85 --> 00:06:14.720
2016 we are also going to talk about

176
00:06:13.31 --> 00:06:16.640
this former prime minister in an

177
00:06:14.72 --> 00:06:18.320
upcoming video so again please do hit

178
00:06:16.64 --> 00:06:19.970
that subscribe button so this victory

179
00:06:18.32 --> 00:06:21.830
for the National Party well it was

180
00:06:19.97 --> 00:06:23.720
historic in a way and this was for two

181
00:06:21.83 --> 00:06:25.340
reasons first because this party had

182
00:06:23.72 --> 00:06:27.650
never got so many votes in an election

183
00:06:25.34 --> 00:06:29.540
and second because if the new government

184
00:06:27.65 --> 00:06:31.550
is confirmed the National Party will

185
00:06:29.54 --> 00:06:33.920
have been in power since 2008 the

186
00:06:31.55 --> 00:06:36.410
longest period in office for a party in

187
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:38.150
New Zealand for more than 50 years and

188
00:06:36.41 --> 00:06:40.220
truth be told there are plenty of

189
00:06:38.15 --> 00:06:42.620
reasons why Bill English won as we have

190
00:06:40.22 --> 00:06:44.540
seen the country is in great shape in

191
00:06:42.62 --> 00:06:46.760
fact it is going through one of the best

192
00:06:44.54 --> 00:06:48.410
moments in its history the economy is

193
00:06:46.76 --> 00:06:50.990
growing unemployment is higher than the

194
00:06:48.41 --> 00:06:53.150
OECD average and unemployment is pretty

195
00:06:50.99 --> 00:06:56.300
scarce plus they also have healthy

196
00:06:53.15 --> 00:06:57.670
public finances during mr. English is

197
00:06:56.3 --> 00:07:00.080
eight years as finance minister

198
00:06:57.67 --> 00:07:02.240
unemployment fell the budget returned to

199
00:07:00.08 --> 00:07:03.620
a surplus and New Zealand enjoyed one of

200
00:07:02.24 --> 00:07:05.270
the highest growth rates in the

201
00:07:03.62 --> 00:07:06.590
developed world the National Party's

202
00:07:05.27 --> 00:07:08.060
intention is to continue with the

203
00:07:06.59 --> 00:07:10.280
politics that they've carried out since

204
00:07:08.06 --> 00:07:11.960
2008 and that's more trade balanced

205
00:07:10.28 --> 00:07:13.910
budget and also trying to keep

206
00:07:11.96 --> 00:07:15.200
immigration rates higher than ever this

207
00:07:13.91 --> 00:07:16.850
has actually been a very important

208
00:07:15.2 --> 00:07:20.120
aspect of their political campaign I

209
00:07:16.85 --> 00:07:22.010
mean if it's not broken don't fix it 181

210
00:07:20.12 --> 00:07:23.930
thousand jobs have been created in the

211
00:07:22.01 --> 00:07:25.580
last two years and the average annual

212
00:07:23.93 --> 00:07:27.470
wage is up thirteen thousand dollars

213
00:07:25.58 --> 00:07:29.060
under national someone working on the

214
00:07:27.47 --> 00:07:30.950
minimum wage has seen their annual

215
00:07:29.06 --> 00:07:32.690
income go up eight thousand dollars

216
00:07:30.95 --> 00:07:35.030
since 2008 bill English

217
00:07:32.69 --> 00:07:36.890
despite this all the campaign hasn't

218
00:07:35.03 --> 00:07:38.450
been as comfortable as some expected

219
00:07:36.89 --> 00:07:40.400
after all even than the most prosperous

220
00:07:38.45 --> 00:07:43.570
country there are challenges and

221
00:07:40.4 --> 00:07:43.570
unresolved issues

222
00:07:45.56 --> 00:07:52.260
Jass and mania and challenges when

223
00:07:50.52 --> 00:07:54.030
Jacinda Edurne was elected leader of the

224
00:07:52.26 --> 00:07:55.800
Labour Party the party wasn't exactly

225
00:07:54.03 --> 00:07:58.140
going through its best moment in the

226
00:07:55.8 --> 00:08:00.540
elections of 2014 the Labour Party

227
00:07:58.14 --> 00:08:02.490
barely got 25 percent of the vote about

228
00:08:00.54 --> 00:08:04.530
half the votes of John Key's National

229
00:08:02.49 --> 00:08:06.360
Party however shortly after they chose a

230
00:08:04.53 --> 00:08:08.430
new leader who was only 37 years old

231
00:08:06.36 --> 00:08:10.770
well things that they started to change

232
00:08:08.43 --> 00:08:13.740
the press they call this just cinder

233
00:08:10.77 --> 00:08:15.450
mania two things have been the keys of

234
00:08:13.74 --> 00:08:17.190
jacinta's campaign housing and

235
00:08:15.45 --> 00:08:19.200
immigration you see one of the problems

236
00:08:17.19 --> 00:08:20.820
in New Zealand is the price of houses

237
00:08:19.2 --> 00:08:22.920
something that has skyrocketed in the

238
00:08:20.82 --> 00:08:24.390
last few years here the price of housing

239
00:08:22.92 --> 00:08:27.170
has increased much more than in

240
00:08:24.39 --> 00:08:30.090
Australia Canada or the United States

241
00:08:27.17 --> 00:08:32.640
New Zealand tops world house price

242
00:08:30.09 --> 00:08:34.560
increase but why is the price of housing

243
00:08:32.64 --> 00:08:36.300
growing quite so much well that's for

244
00:08:34.56 --> 00:08:39.210
several reasons that there are three

245
00:08:36.3 --> 00:08:40.440
main causes first economy and salaries

246
00:08:39.21 --> 00:08:42.660
are increasing a lot in New Zealand

247
00:08:40.44 --> 00:08:44.010
second immigration rates are higher than

248
00:08:42.66 --> 00:08:45.720
ever this is one of the countries that

249
00:08:44.01 --> 00:08:47.430
receives the most immigrants every year

250
00:08:45.72 --> 00:08:48.900
relative to their population and more

251
00:08:47.43 --> 00:08:51.590
immigrants that means a greater demand

252
00:08:48.9 --> 00:08:51.590
for housing

253
00:08:53.02 --> 00:08:57.520
and third because many millionaires and

254
00:08:55.33 --> 00:08:59.110
investors especially from Asia but also

255
00:08:57.52 --> 00:09:00.670
from other parts of the world want to

256
00:08:59.11 --> 00:09:02.980
buy houses here to put their money in a

257
00:09:00.67 --> 00:09:04.450
safe place and also to enjoy the country

258
00:09:02.98 --> 00:09:07.089
one example of these people would be

259
00:09:04.45 --> 00:09:08.620
Jack Mar the CEO of Alibaba - the

260
00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:10.450
National Party they wanted to tackle

261
00:09:08.62 --> 00:09:12.610
this issue by making construction easy

262
00:09:10.45 --> 00:09:14.410
and fast the Labour Party of Jacinda

263
00:09:12.61 --> 00:09:16.570
Edurne came up with two suggestions

264
00:09:14.41 --> 00:09:18.730
first reducing the number of immigrants

265
00:09:16.57 --> 00:09:20.770
by half and seconds preventing foreign

266
00:09:18.73 --> 00:09:25.870
investors from buying houses in new

267
00:09:20.77 --> 00:09:27.250
zealand's it was this speech on housing

268
00:09:25.87 --> 00:09:29.020
and immigration that got him the support

269
00:09:27.25 --> 00:09:31.270
of the party and polls that seemed to

270
00:09:29.02 --> 00:09:33.310
indicate that at times was a very close

271
00:09:31.27 --> 00:09:33.850
race but once the elections arrived the

272
00:09:33.31 --> 00:09:40.270
Kiwis

273
00:09:33.85 --> 00:09:41.800
well they did not hesitate let's be

274
00:09:40.27 --> 00:09:43.690
clear New Zealand it's a great country

275
00:09:41.8 --> 00:09:44.140
but it does have some obstacles to

276
00:09:43.69 --> 00:09:46.360
overcome

277
00:09:44.14 --> 00:09:48.100
housing improving Maori integration and

278
00:09:46.36 --> 00:09:49.930
technical education are a few of these

279
00:09:48.1 --> 00:09:51.580
things but in the grand scheme of things

280
00:09:49.93 --> 00:09:52.899
they're pretty small problems now we're

281
00:09:51.58 --> 00:09:54.220
going to discuss some of these problems

282
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:55.810
in a future video but for now New

283
00:09:54.22 --> 00:09:57.370
Zealanders they can enjoy some of the

284
00:09:55.81 --> 00:09:59.410
best living standards in the world

285
00:09:57.37 --> 00:10:00.760
anyway now it's your turn we'd love to

286
00:09:59.41 --> 00:10:02.170
know what you think would you like to

287
00:10:00.76 --> 00:10:03.520
spend some time in New Zealand what do

288
00:10:02.17 --> 00:10:05.140
