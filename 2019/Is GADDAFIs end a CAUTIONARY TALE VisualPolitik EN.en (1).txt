00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,860
just before we get into today's video I

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,380
do want to give a random YouTube plug

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,850
sometimes I'm browsing around on YouTube

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,379
and I'll stumble across a channel that I

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,780
think is criminally under subscribes and

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,759
that channel that I'd like to tell you

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,219
about today is called dumb money we are

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,560
dumb money we quit our day jobs to do

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,859
this I'm going to check out the closest

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,720
canvas dispenser even to this sort of

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,760
stuff the political and economic thing

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,980
this is more business-focused channel

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,660
I'm not getting paid to say this or

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,220
anything like that it's just a channel

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,750
that I stumbled across I really like

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,550
it's got a few thousand subscribers and

17
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,920
I'd like to send them some more so that

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,750
is well this is about you'll find them

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,450
linked to below just go check it out and

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,070
let's get on with it

21
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,720
[Music]

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,490
nobody likes dictators but what happens

23
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,160
when the alternative is even worse well

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,680
this is the story of Libya this is the

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,600
story of former prime minister Gaddafi's

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,270
rise and his fall

27
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,819
[Applause]

28
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,229
[Music]

29
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:09,450
Lydia has more oil reserves than America

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,920
in fact they have the biggest oil

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,049
reserves in Africa then again production

32
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,330
wise they are far below most of the

33
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,330
famous oil countries even below Iran

34
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,740
despite Trump's sanctions

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,900
[Music]

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,510
why well maybe you've heard of the Arab

37
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,730
Spring after that period of uprisings

38
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,250
and general destabilization Olivia is

39
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,470
the country that ended up the worst off

40
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,300
basically there's a lesson to be learned

41
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,890
from Libya and that's that no matter how

42
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,750
bad you think a country might be doing

43
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,360
it can always be doing worse maybe

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
you've seen the movie The Dictator by

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,450
Sacha Baron Cohen

46
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,310
well this parody was pretty much

47
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,330
inspired by Gaddafi

48
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,740
[Music]

49
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,810
indeed here's one of the craziest

50
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,479
dictators of all time and he ruled in

51
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,119
Libya for decades Gaddafi was well known

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,070
for having his own harem of about 30

53
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,290
women this harem was known as the

54
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,810
Amazonian guard

55
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,280
from the early 1970s onwards they

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,160
remained close at his side at all times

57
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,420
sometimes the women even took bullets

58
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,790
figgered aathi one woman died and two

59
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,319
were injured when the Libyan leader was

60
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,569
attacked in 1998 some of the conditions

61
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,550
do become part of the guard were to make

62
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,620
an oath of virginity dress in camouflage

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,140
and maintain perfect nail polish and

64
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,030
makeup of course there are thousands of

65
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,010
reports of rape and abuse that came to

66
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,349
light after Gaddafi's death surprisingly

67
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,940
during his lifetime Gaddafi always

68
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,190
congratulated himself as a protector of

69
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:45,420
women's rights in the Arab world

70
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,130
but not only that the self-proclaimed

71
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,709
brother leader had a massive fear of

72
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,480
heights and could not fly more than

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,490
eight hours over water he also had some

74
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,290
peculiar demands when he stayed in

75
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,880
hotels he always had to stay on the

76
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,530
first floor and he would not climb more

77
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,280
than 35 steps so yes if we make a video

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,410
ranking the most extravagant dictators

79
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,450
of all time Gaddafi would certainly be

80
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,880
in our top ten diplomacy wise Gaddafi is

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,350
one of those dictators though when from

82
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,660
being America's worst enemy to a friend

83
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,270
of the US before becoming yet again the

84
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,310
man America loved to hate and today

85
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,160
Libya is a chaotic state where even

86
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,170
foreign oil companies have to make deals

87
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,209
with warlords in order to keep pumping

88
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,910
oil don't believe me well just have a

89
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,020
look at this news

90
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,030
Repsol oil fields in Libya go back to

91
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,520
business after deal with Raiders in this

92
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,560
case a Spanish oil company Repsol has

93
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,390
and agreements with the Libyan National

94
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,000
Oil Corporation in 2008 back then they

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,530
just had to agree with the dictatorship

96
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,870
in order to do business then during the

97
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,580
Libyan Civil War a different warlord

98
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,890
took over Repsol facilities and finally

99
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,290
after a lot of struggle in 2018 there

100
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,459
all the company had to make an agreement

101
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,370
with a local tribe so what happens here

102
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,980
what's going on in Libya today and why

103
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,930
would an oil company make a deal with a

104
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,519
warlord well today we're going to answer

105
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,319
all of these questions but before we do

106
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,269
let's take a look back at the history

107
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:15,640
the man you love to hate have you ever

108
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,250
seen the movie naked gun it starts with

109
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,139
the scene where Gaddafi appears next to

110
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,759
the other bad guys at the moment they

111
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,009
are men Ayatollah Khomeini Gorbachev

112
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,590
Yasser Arafat Fidel Castro they're all

113
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,270
gathered in this room and they're making

114
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,250
a plan to defeat the United States

115
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,350
yes dear viewer that was a time when

116
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,240
Gaddafi was considered to be one of the

117
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
worst evils on the planet why well let's

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,360
take a look back in time

119
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,759
[Music]

120
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:45,009
Libya was an Italian colony for several

121
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,749
decades in the early 1900s then it

122
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:50,319
became a monarchy until in 1969 Gaddafi

123
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,910
rose to power

124
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,580
he believed in so-called Arab socialism

125
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,500
a strange cocktail of centralized

126
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,720
economy secularism and cult of

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,610
personality he even developed his own

128
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,320
political philosophy writing an

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,690
extremely influential book the Green

130
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,110
Book

131
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,090
he made countless appearances at Arab

132
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,070
and international gatherings standing

133
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,780
out not just with his outlandish

134
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,210
clothing but also because of his blunt

135
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,400
speeches and odd behavior even some

136
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,870
socialist parties in Europe Webb

137
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,370
sponsored by him the reality was that

138
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,370
oil could pay for a lot of influence in

139
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:31,460
the rest of the world but unlike other

140
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,870
countries like Egypt he didn't

141
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,580
nationalize oil he bit harder conditions

142
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,010
on foreign oil companies but that was

143
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,780
all he challenged our executives by

144
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,070
stating people who have lived without

145
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,500
oil for 5000 years can live without it

146
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,200
again for a few years in order to attain

147
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,270
their legitimate rights that was a bold

148
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,160
move a move that helped him secure a

149
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,320
majority share of oil company revenues

150
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,180
while at the same time maintaining an

151
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,890
effective oil industry in the country

152
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,630
despite the socialism and the

153
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,340
dictatorship Libya was still open for

154
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,170
business

155
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,170
but Saul says Libyan oil nationalization

156
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,420
unlikely and let's be honest here the

157
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,340
Ferger worked many European companies

158
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,860
like Eni total and drabs all kept doing

159
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,870
business with Libya money came on money

160
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,330
went in oil came out and the country

161
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,490
citizens they benefited for years Libya

162
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,990
had the highest Human Development Index

163
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,840
of any African country at certain points

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,000
it even surpassed South Africa this

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,650
always accompanied by a very

166
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,690
controversial foreign policy during the

167
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,120
1980s and 1990s Gaddafi aligned himself

168
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,400
with the Eastern Bloc Fidel Castro's

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,920
Cuba and openly supported movements like

170
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,630
the Irish Republican Army and the

171
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,820
Palestinian Liberation Front but none of

172
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,770
this would have been a big deal if it

173
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,540
wasn't for the Terrorism

174
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,170
[Music]

175
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,370
the LEAs government was known to

176
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,030
participate or

177
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,460
aid in terrorist attacks many Marxist

178
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,050
inspired guerrilla groups or even

179
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,270
terrorist groups were funded by Gaddafi

180
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,010
but the defining moments was the bombing

181
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,960
of a nightclub in Berlin where American

182
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,970
soldiers used frequence many Libyan

183
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,560
spies were involved in this since

184
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,020
America it didn't wait to answer 7

185
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,090
o'clock this evening Eastern Time air

186
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,010
and naval forces of the United States

187

but let's press on forward with our

207
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,170
story in 2001 9/11 happened since this

208
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,030
was a turning point for Gaddafi's

209
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,480
foreign policy

inspired by socialism not by radical

Islam

214
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,020
therefore Osama bin Laden was a common

215
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,420
enemy both of America and many socialist

216
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,550

217
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,560
collaborating with America he signs a

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,420
nuclear disarmament agreements in which

219
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,100
the leader agreed to eliminate his

220
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,750
country's nuclear weapons the US

221
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,210
declared victory and everything else was

222
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,610
good again in 2006 they even took Libya

223
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,290
off the list of terrorist countries

224
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,200
Gaddafi he was a son of a bit but you

225
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,390
know at least he was now our son of the

226
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,140

sacrifice would spark a revolution all

234
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,950

was so desperate to cling on to but

massive rates of defection the rebels

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,540
tried organizing even further but they

267
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,070
were being hit pretty hard by the

Colonel's forces as you can imagine

269
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,150
Gaddafi had an army much bigger than

270
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,340
those thirty women from his Amazon Guard

271
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,500
Libyan oil has also helped pay for a lot

272
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,300
of modern weaponry and this was pretty

273
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,920
helpful in repressing protesters but so

274
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,690
many people lost their lives the urge of

275
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,640
Gaddafi outside of Libya it simply

cannot be a power vacuum Gaddafi was

remove him from power and intervene

318
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,980
militarily in order to cut off the Arab

319
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,380
Revolution that had flared up in Tunisia

320
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,050
and Egypt it also provided powers such

321
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,610
as France and Britain a chance to

322
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,170
reassert themselves on the world stage

323
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,840
after Gaddafi's death Libya was torn up

324
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,250
and divided without a national

325
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,990
government to claim control then what

326
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,400
that meant at the time was that local

327
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,620
militias had the power of life and death

328
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,200
over the population the economy was also

329
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
pretty messed up as on might expect

330
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,790
after a revolution the GDP collapsed in

331
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,060
2014 and in 2015 the production of crude

332
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,400
oil fell to the lowest levels since the

333
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:55,260
1970s ex NATO boss Libya is still a

334
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,420
model intervention you see unlike the

335
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,310
Iraq or Afghanistan war the Libyan one

336
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,930
was a different animal in this case it

337
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,570
was not led by America but instead by

338
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,400
France and the French military style it

339
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,280
couldn't be more different

340
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,360
usually the Americans invade a country

341
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,010
kill the dictator and then stay there

342
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,620
for a few years we've seen this in Japan

343
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,510
and in Germany after World War two but

344
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,910
also later in Iraq and Afghanistan the

345
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,920
military tries to make sure that they

346
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,690
can form a post-war governments and

347
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,760
fight the last groups that supported the

348
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,110
former one the French they're pretty

349
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,700
much the opposites they strike they kill

350
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,230
the bad guy and they get out of there

351
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,670
this is what happened in Mali for

352
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,770
example and this is what happened in

353
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,260
Libya so effectiveness wise the Libyan

354
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,090
war was a complete success in fact if

355
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,310
you look at this chart you can see that

356
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,780
it was one of the cheapest wars in

357
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,310
modern history it took only a little

358
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,840
more than a month to complete compared

359
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,670
with Iraq or Afghanistan the Libyan war

360
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,600

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,680
Turkey and Qatar the government of

368
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,110
Tobruk supported namely by Egypt and the

369
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,150
United Arab Emirates and last but not

370
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,310
least die ash forces war rage wants more

371
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,650

372
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,410
expanded rapidly the elections in 2014

373
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,720
were marred by violence and low turnout

374
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,240
eventually a compromise was found and a

375
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,520
government of national agreements it was

376
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,250
formed supported by the UN a group that

377
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,050
monitors violence using media reports

378
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,810
estimated that more than 4600 people

379
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,760
have died in the fighting since the

380
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,850
beginning of 2014 and the UN estimates

381
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,280
that 2.4 million people about a third of

382
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,840
Libya's population have been affected by

383
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,610
the fighting which has led to shortages

384
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,580
of food water electricity and medical

385
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,530
supplies and it's also reduced access to

386
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,089
health care and public services

387
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,339
Forgotten War a crisis deepens in Libya

388
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,380
but where are the cameras as you might

389
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,360
have noticed Libya isn't doing much

390
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
better today the government installed in

391
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,190
2016 only has a partial hold on the

392
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,930
country given this instability there are

393
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,790
no facilities and desert patrols to

394
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,589
tackle trafficking networks there are

395
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,870
also no funds for Libya's Coast Guard to

396
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,089
monitor sea crossings and this is why in

397
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,800
this dangerous power vacuum oil

398
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,570
companies are even starting to make

399
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,120
deals with local tribes in order to keep

400
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,690
their businesses going

401
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,420
the Repsol camp in Libya resume activity

402
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,820
after agreement with the assailants

403
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,220
despite all the turmoil Repsol is still

404
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,230
going strong in Libya and is currently

405
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,790
preparing to increase production even

406
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,080
more money

407
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,209
it seems really does talk now the

408
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,339
question is if even big oil companies

409
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,350
are making deals with rebels does a

410
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,480
unified Libyan government's really have

411
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,700
a chance I mean will we ever see a

412
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,529
democratic and stable government in this
